"The Yoga Yajnavalkya Sanskrit , Yoga Yajnavalkya is a classical Hindu yoga text in the Sanskrit language. The text is written in the form of a male female dialogue between the sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi. The text consists of 12 chapters and contains 504 verses. Yoga Yajnavalkya Like Patanjali's Yogasutras, the Yoga Yajnavalkya describes the eight components of yoga however, it has different goals. The text contains additional material that is not found in Yogasutras, such as the concept of kundalini. The Yoga Yajnavalkya contains one of the most comprehensive discussion of yoga components such as the Pranayama, Pratyahara Dhyana, and Dharana. The text was influential in the development and practice of the yoga traditions of India before the 12th century. The text is attributed to Yajnavalkya, a revered Vedic sage in Hinduism. He is estimated to have lived in around the 8th century BCE, and is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named Yajnavalkya Smrti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya. He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, as well as in ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim. These references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya, may be to different sages with the same name. The actual author of Yoga Yajnavalkya text was probably someone who lived many centuries after the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya, and is unknown. Ian Whicher, a professor of Religion at the University of Manitoba, writes that the author of Yoga Yajnavalkya may be an ancient Yajnavalkya, but this Yajnavalkya is not to be confused with the Vedic era Yajnavalkya who is revered in Hinduism for Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . David White, a professor of Comparative Religion at the University of California, suggests that the author a 9th to 12th century South Indian with the name of Yajnavalkya was the author of two works that combined the eight part practice with teachings on Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy the Yoga Yajnavalkya and the Yogi Yajnavalkya smriti. This issue has since been clarified in a 2017 study of the two works. According to Dominik Wujastyk a scholar of Sanskrit literature, Indology and the history of Yoga philosophy and practice, the Yoga Yajnavalkya is an early text on yoga. Many versions of its manuscripts have been discovered, with two pre 10th century CE palm leaf manuscripts in Sanskrit, while many more versions have been found in other regional languages of the Indian subcontinent. The original text is likely many centuries older. The variations between the manuscripts suggest that this text was compiled and revised by multiple authors. Yoga Yajnavalkya 1.43 The composition date of Yoga Yajnavalkya is unclear. Prahlad Divanji, an Indologist and Sanskrit scholar, states that the text was composed between the second century BCE and fourth century CE, because Yoga Upanishads and Hatha Yoga texts contain verses from Yoga Yajnavalkya. Divanji cites Tantra texts, Ayurveda tradition texts, and literature of Advaita Vedanta from the 4th century CE, which mention the Yoga Yajnavalkya, thereafter concluding that the text or some version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya text must have been in existence by the 4th century CE. However, adds Divanji, the text is likely to have been composed after Patanjali's Yogasutra, which itself is variously estimated to have composed sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE. Divanji premises his dating proposal from the observation that Yoga Yajnavalkya expands on ideas in Patanjali's text, such as its list of Yamas, which includes the Patanjali's five plus five additional ones. A. G. Mohan, an author and yoga teacher, states that the text was likely completed before the 4th century CE. David White, in contrast, suggests the date of composition to be much later, between the 10th and 12th centuries. White states that the 13th century Dattatreya Yoga shastra acknowledges Yajnavalkya, and describes its teachings as supplementary to the eight part practice as taught by Yajnavalkya , which means that the text was already established and accepted by then. Other manuscripts with devotional, non mental and mental yoga texts in the Hindu tradition also refer to teachings of the text, suggesting the text originated before many other yoga texts. Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune version of a manuscript of the text to about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that this version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text. According to Dominik Wujastyk, two of its manuscripts MS Kathmandu NAK 5 696 now preserved in Nepal , MS London BL Or. 3568 preserved in the British Library are amongst the oldest surviving Sanskrit manuscripts found on the Indian subcontinent. The first is dated to the early 10th century or late 9th century, while the one discovered in Nepal is dated to 1024 CE from its colophon. The original text is likely much older than these palm leaf manuscript copies. Several versions of the Yoga Yajnavalkya manuscripts are known. The earliest published manuscript of Yoga Yajnavalkya was discovered in Bengal in 1893. Since then, other manuscripts have been discovered with differing numbers of verses. The text published by Divanji in 1954, for example, has over 500 verses, while the manuscript translated by Krishnamacharya and Desikachar, writers and teachers of yoga books, has 460 verses. A study of the manuscripts reveals that there are two quite different works that are often both called Yogayajnavalkya. The work discussed in this Wikipedia page is often called the Yogayajnavalkyagita in the manuscripts. A much older, and quite different work that does not discuss yoga postures, is called the Yogiyajnavalkyasmrti or the Sarasamuccaya of the Yogayajnavalkya in manuscripts. The Yoga Yajnavalkya or Yogayajnavalkya text is structured as a conversation between a man Yajnavalkya and a woman Gargi , in the presence of an audience. It is organized into twelve chapters, and cumulatively contains 504 verses. The text opens with a discussion of virtues and lifestyle of a yogi, with 70 verses in the first chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas. The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body. Meditation discussions start in the eighth chapter of the text, where 40 verses discuss how to start and develop meditative practices with the help of Om and resonating sounds, followed by 44 verses in the ninth chapter for advanced meditation that is reflective on one's mind, Vedana feelings and nature of one's Atman self, soul . The text dedicates 23 verses in the tenth chapter on samadhi concentration to become aware of the equality of one's Atman and Brahman Universal Ultimate Reality, God . The final sections of the text discuss the need for a Guru teacher along with the duties of a yogin, and what to do when one realizes one has made a mistake. The last chapter briefly discusses the kundalini, the benefits of yoga and the nature of calmness, contentedness in one's mind and consciousness. The text opens with reverence and introduction for Yajnavalkya and Gargi, and then gives its purpose to disclose the nature of yoga . In verses 10 to 19, Gargi remarks that yoga has been called the best karma, and asks Yajnavalkya to explain yoga to her. Yajnavalkya agrees, but first attributes his knowledge to the Hindu god Brahma who taught him this jnana knowledge and karma works . Yajnavalkya states that there are two paths to attain knowledge. One path is Pravritti karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth. Yoga Yajnavalkya 1.441.47 Verses 1.2740 are a non yoga commentary on the duties of four social classes this section is missing in manuscripts of Yoga Yajnavalkya that contain 460 verses. The commentary presents two theories on the duties of the four Varna in terms of ashrama dharmas of Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. One theory allows only the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to enter Brahmacharya and study the Vedas, and the other states that Shudras can also enter Brahmacharya. Neither theory is recommended, and according to Bhattacharya's translation it adds that all four varnas are required to pay off the debts owed to the sages, men and gods by practicing Brahmacharya, procreating offspring and performing karma. All four social classes should strive for Nivritti karma work without craving for rewards . According to Desikachar's translation, yoga is open to all, without restrictions to varna or gender. Verses 1.4149 state that karma with knowledge is the means to liberation . Yoga is the essence of this knowledge, and it has eight components Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. To never cause suffering to other beings by thought, word or deed. That is non harmfulness. To always say what is, and by that create good for all living beings that is the practice of truthfulness. Relinquishing the desire for the possessions of others, in deed, word and thought that is non covetousness thus say the sages who have realized the ultimate truth. Yoga Yajnavalkya 1.521.54, The Yoga Yajnavalkya starts its description of yoga practice with a statement of virtuous self restraints that a yogi or yogini needs to adhere to. This list is longer than the five yamas listed by Patanjali in Yogasutra, but similar to those found in other Hindu texts such as the Shandilya Upanishad and other ancient and medieval era Yoga texts. Verses 1.5051 of Yoga Yajnavalkya list the following ten Yamas the restraints , while verses 1.5270 explain what these virtues mean and why they are necessary Verse 1.69 asserts that in a cleansed body resides a peaceful mind, and when this mind achieves purity, Atmavidya knowledge of soul becomes feasible. The chapter 2 begins with a list of ten Niyamas the Observance, Do these list, positive duties , followed by an explanation of each in the rest of the chapter. The list is again longer than the list of five found in Patanjali's Yogasutras, but similar to those found in the Shandilya and Varaha Upanishads, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and verses 552 to 557 in Book 3 of the Tirumandhiram of Tirumular, in the sense of positive duties, desirable behaviors and discipline. The list of the ten niyamas are Richard Rosen, yoga teacher and a contributing editor at Yoga Journal, states that the first two chapters provides the moral foundations of its yoga teachings, and are more detailed than many other yoga texts in the Indian traditions. Chapter 3 is short, and opens with a list of eight asanas postures , followed by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.35 and 3.1314 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas. Cleansing asanas are those that when practiced for short periods of time help the body prevent or correct internal imbalances and tone inner organs while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi blood vessels through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana lotus position is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation. Gargi inquires in chapter 4 about the nature of Nadis, the human body and how vital airs function in it. Yajnavalkya begins his reply by asserting that the height of every adult human being is about 96 times the width of his or her Angula thumb . The Prana breath, vital air of the body is dispersed within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part of the body, and he calls it the Nabhi center and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her. Verses 4.2635 state that the human body has fourteen nadis blood vessels , of which three are primary. Sushumna Sanskrit is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining the whole body. Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On both sides of the Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Gunas forces behind the innate character of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva goodness , Pingala driving the Rajas action , and Ida driving the Tamas destructiveness . These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the whole body, and nourish it. When one inhales or exhales, according to verses 4.4765, the Nadis are loaded with vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts. The body interacts with nature, and removes liquids and excretes waste through nine holes. The aim of pranayama breath control is to purify the channels and nourish the inner body with vital airs. This benefits a yogi and yogini in preventing and curing diseases, as well as preparing the mind for meditation. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the means of cleansing the body and mind. The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self restraints Yamas , observances Niyamas , avoiding anger against anyone or anything, truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru teacher , and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for rewards of one's action. Solitary places are the best venues for yoga. A matha hut in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense sunshine is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, with the help of a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years. The text dedicates the largest number of verses to the discussion of breath and breath exercises. Yoga Yajnavalkya 6.1 Yajnavalkya dedicates significant amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is discussed in terms of its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava Om , Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras. The text classifies three levels of breath regulation, namely Puraka , satisfying , Kumbhaka , prominent and Rechaka , purging . The Puraka exercise is shortest and counts twelve moments matras, music beats the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas for the purposes of energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind. Chapter 7 discusses the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which it says is of five forms. This stage is one where the focus of the mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness. The theory of Marma joints is presented, and 18 vital points inside one's body are listed that can be used as focal points to help initial stages of the meditative exercises. Verses 110 of chapter 8 elaborate on the practice of Dharana or meditation to train the mind in the consciousness of the self. The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems, and that systems are gods residing within the human body. The next level of meditation is to fix one's undistracted attention to these five, while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step. The five deities are addressed by chanting the five letters or syllables Bijamantra which are the sounds of the Chakras which are lam , vam , ram , yam , and ham to become one with Parameshvara God . Verses 8.1115 state that a yogin should practice meditating on these respective body systems as deities, with the help of Om mantra, as this leads to dissolution, and realization of the Brahman Purusha. After mastery is achieved with the aid of envisioning the five deities within one's body, the text mentions that the yogin overcomes three Dosha , faults . The chapter ends by reminding the yoga student to not forget the daily duties and works, the virtuous self restraints yamas and virtuous observances niyamas as he gains mastery to this level of yoga. Chapter 9 discusses Dhyana limb of yoga. Dhyana can lead to freedom or bondage, depending on how and what one concentrates on. Freedom comes from realizing the oneness of individual self with the universal self. The Nirguna non qualified, attribute less form of meditation is best suited for those who have mastered the vital airs as well as all the Asanas with inner awareness of Marmans vital points and Nadis blood vessels . These yogins and yoginis can abstract, feel the Self within, and should meditate on I am Brahman, who is all pervasive, all embracing, all perceiving and full of bliss . Yoga Yajnavalkya 9.13 The Saguna meditation, that is qualified and with attributes, is for those who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is the path to the state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana. The text suggests variations to the Saguna meditation, such as perceiving the union of a golden disc with four faced golden Purusha, imagining a lustrous inner self inside oneself and then oneness with it, and other variations. Verses 9.4344 state that the inner self, whether meditated upon as Nirguna or Saguna, is one and the same. Yoga Yajnavalkya 10.15 Chapter 10 states meditation practice perfects one's ability to concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes the one of attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.615 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation. Verses 10.1923 advise that those who seek liberation in life or after death, should do yoga and reach the stage of Samadhi wherein one fixes one's mind on the supreme self. This is recommended for those in their advanced years and seekers of inner liberation and peace. Yajnavalkya suggests to Gargi that she should meditate on the self in her through yoga, and thus attain nirvana. Gargi, in chapter 11 asks Yajnavalkya whether a yogin in the state of Samadhi needs to perform Vedic duties. He replies, No, any one in the state of yoga need not do Vedic duties , because that state is the goal. However, anyone who leaves the state of Samadhi must perform Dharmic duties because no living being can survive without performing any actions . All duties should be performed until the end of one's life, when the self unites with the supreme self. Gargi then asks Yagnavalkya to summarize the eight components of yoga. In the first 47 verses of chapter 12, Yajnavalkya elucidates Siddha yoga and Kundalini. The aim of these yogic exercises, according to verses 12.14, is to reach the internal fire with Prana life force, breath energy these should be performed three times daily for ten days. With the vital air under control through the yoga, the yogin realizes signs of progress such as a relaxed state of body, manifested divine sound or nada inside. Verses 12.1014 state that this Kundalini fire is situated in the navel, and should be meditated upon by breathing exercises. This warms up the Kundalini, awakening her, and the warmth glows through the entire body, and at this stage the yogin must draw the breath above the navel. Yoga Yajnavalkya 12.22 Yagnavalkya explains that warm air inhaled passes to the Brahmarandhra via the navel which helps in curing diseases. When hot air is retained in the heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand petaled lotus, that then emerges in an inverted form. When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman Atman , which is the heart, according to verses 12.1522, the fire located in the region of Susumna, which is between the eyebrows glows. These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead to the perception of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta mind . Verses 12.2331 state that the lingasharira, which is the subtle body that is not visible, glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead. This shining Shakti force, energy, power , translates Bhattacharya, is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision. Atman is perceived when the mind located in the space between the eyebrows, becomes free of all distractions and activities. In this state, the yogin becomes aware of self within, and in the sages, in siddhas and others. If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye brows does not occur, the yogin should envision absolute bliss, alternatively the full moon inside the mouth. This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity, helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha sky , and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation. This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge, the goal of the practice of yoga. Brahman is the origin of all, it is all that exists and all that into which it will dissolve back, and the Vedas teach that this Brahman resides in the heart of a person. It is, translates Bhattacharya, subtler than the subtle, greater than the great and is perceived with the cleansing of one's mind and intellect, one achievable with breathing exercises, sacred sound exercises and yoga. Following the complete exposition of all the principles of yoga, Yagnavalkya leaves for a secluded place to continue his meditative contemplation, while Gargi forsakes her world, retires to a forest hermitage, and seeks refuge in the practice of yoga. Two English translations of the complete text are known, one by Desikachar and the other by Mohan, while Bhattacharya has published a condensed summary of the twelve chapters. Divisions Sama vedic Yajur vedic Atharva vedic Vaishnava puranas Shaiva puranas According to Desikachar's translation In the 1960s only two versions of this valuable text were available Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society BBRAS and Trivandrum editions , and both were incomplete or inaccurate. He took the pains of writing the whole manuscript. Desikachar further states in his introduction However many verses of this twelve chapter text are missing in both versions... He even corrected those manuscripts that were incomplete. In The Heart of Yoga, Desikachar indicates There is one critical edition of the Yoga Yajnavalkya written by Sri Prabhad C. Divanji . According to A. G. Mohan's English translation However, a comparative reading shows that the Desikachar edition is a faithful reproduction of the 1938 Trivandrum publication. The only edits made are to fill in a negligible number of missing words around 60 words out of 6000 in mostly obvious contexts. There are no significant corrections to existing verses. The Divanji publication is easily more complete and error free, containing copious footnotes comparing different versions of the text from sixteen manuscripts and five printed editions including the Trivandrum publication ... The Trivandrum publication offered by the Desikachar misses 39 12 verses that appear in the Divanji publication. According to David White, Yoga Yajnavalkya was more significant in practice than the Patanjali's Yogasutras before the 12th century. Among the texts on asanas and meditation, it dominated the Indian yoga scene. Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha, chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga, Pashupata Yoga and Tantric Yoga, the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions. Secondary Sanskrit language texts from the 9th to 12th centuries incorporate the ideas of Yoga Yajnavalkya into their own traditions. These include the bhasya commentary of Lakshmidhara and manuscripts of Vedanta schools such as Advaita Vedanta that discuss and incorporate yoga philosophy and practices as essential for their traditions. The presence of Gargi in Yoga Yajnavalkya is significant in a historical sense, as encouraging yoga to women. According to Divanji, the text includes some yoga related verses exclusively addressed to women, such as those in verses 1.2140, 2.89 and 6.1120. The text was influential on many later yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga kundalini Upanishad and Yogatattva Upanishad, because they make frequent references to it. The philosophical premises of Yajnavalkya and Patanjali are different, according to Richard Rosen. Patanjali accepts the dualism premise, and defines yoga as cessation of mental activity associated with sensory interaction with nature, leading to Kaivalya aloneness of the self and a state of self awareness. Yajnavalkya accepts the Advaita Vedanta premise of non dualism, essential oneness of self and nature , and defines yoga as path to intense interconnectedness between Jiva and Paramatman, where the union of self and supreme self is realized.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga%20Yajnavalkya
"The Yogatattva Upanishad Sanskrit , IAST Yogatattva Upanishad , also called as Yogatattvopanishad , is one of the important Upanishads of Hinduism. A Sanskrit text, it is one of eleven Yoga Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda, and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. It is listed at number 41 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. Two major versions of its manuscripts are known. One has fifteen verses but attached to Atharvaveda, while another very different and augmented manuscript exists in the Telugu language which has one hundred and forty two verses and is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda. The text is notable for describing Yoga in the Vaishnavism tradition. The Yogatattva Upanishad shares ideas with the Yogasutra, Hatha Yoga, and Kundalini Yoga. It includes a discussion of four styles of yoga Mantra, Laya, Hatha yoga and Raja. As an expounder of Vedanta philosophy, the Upanishad is devoted to the elaboration of the meaning of Atman Soul, Self through the process of yoga, starting with the syllable Om. According to Yogatattva Upanishad, jnana knowledge without yoga cannot secure moksha emancipation, salvation , nor can yoga without knowledge secure moksha , and that those who seek emancipation should pursue both yoga and knowledge . Yoga from the Sanskrit root yuj means to add , to join , to unite , or to attach in its most common literal sense. According to Dasgupta a scholar of Sanskrit and philosophy, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga to yoke or yuj samadhau to concentrate . Yogatattva is compound word of Yoga and 'tattva', the latter meaning Truth , or Reality, That ness . Paul Deussen a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy translates the term Yogatattva as the essence of Yoga . The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or hidden doctrine text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas. The text, states Mircea Eliade, was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads Brahmabindu probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad , Ksurika, Tejobindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu, and Amritabindu. The Yogatattva, adds Eliade, was composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma. Alternate chronological estimates include those by Michael Whiteman a professor of Mathematics and a writer on Yoga in Hinduism and Buddhism, who states it is possibly dated to about 150 CE. David White a professor of Comparative Religion, in contrast, suggests that the text derives its ideas and images from the heritage of classical Vedanta , and it is likely a medieval era text composed between 11th to 13th century CE. Gavin Flood dates the Yogatattva text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. In the collection of Upanishads under the title Oupanekhat , put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Yogatattva is listed at number 21. Dara Shikoh's collection was in the same order as found in Upanishad anthologies popular in north India. In the 52 Upanishads version of Colebrooke this Upanishad is listed at 23. In the Bibliothica Indica edition of Narayana an Indian scholar who lived sometime after the 14th century Vedanta scholar Sankarananda, the Upanishad is also listed at 23 in his list of 52. The Telugu version of the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses, while the shortest surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses. Both versions open by hailing Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme Purusha or supreme spirit, the great Yogin, the Supreme Being, the great Tapasvin meditator , and a lamp in the path of the truth. This links the text to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism. The meaning and message in verses 3 to 15 of the Sanskrit version mirror those of the last 13 verses of the Telugu version of the text. The Yogatattva Upanishad is among the oldest known texts on yoga that provide detailed description of Yoga techniques and its benefits. For the first time, an Upanishad gives numerous and precise details concerning the extraordinary powers gained by practice and meditation. The four chief asanas siddha, padma, simha and bhadra are mentioned, as are the obstacles encountered by beginners sloth, talkativeness, etc. A description of pranayama follows, together with the definition of the matra unit of measurement for the phases of respiration , and important details of mystical physiology the purification of the nadis is shown by external signs lightness of body, brilliance of complexion, increase in digestive power, etc. On Hindu god Brahma's request Vishnu explains that all souls are caught up in the cycle of worldly pleasures and sorrow created by Maya changing reality . and Kaivalya can help overcome this cycle of birth, old age and disease. Knowledge of the shastras are futile in this regard, states Vishnu, and the description of the indescribable state of liberation eludes them and even the devas. It is only the knowledge of ultimate reality and supreme self, the Brahman, which can lead to the path of liberation and self realization, states Yogatattva Upanishad. This realization of the supreme self is possible to the yoga student who is free from passion, anger, fear, delusion, greed, pride, lust, birth, death, miserliness, swoon, giddiness, hunger, thirst, ambition, shame, fright, heart burning, grief and gladness . In the early verses of the Yogatattva Upanishad, the simultaneous importance of yoga and jnana knowledge are asserted, and declared to be mutually complimentary and necessary. I relate to you the means to be employed for destruction of errors Without the practice of yoga, how could knowledge set the Atman free Inversely, how could the practice of yoga alone, devoid of knowledge, succeed in the task The seeker of Liberation must direct his energies to both simultaneously. The source of unhappiness lies in Ajnana ignorance Knowledge alone sets one free. This is a dictum found in all Vedas. Yogatattva verses 1416 The text defines knowledge , translates Aiyar a Sanskrit scholar, as through which one cognizes in himself the real nature of kaivalya moksha as the supreme seat, the stainless, the partless, and of the nature of Sacchidananda truth consciousness bliss . This knowledge is of the Brahman and its non differentiated nature with that of the Atman, of Jiva and Paramatman. Yoga and knowledge jnana both go together to realise Brahman and attain salvation, according to the Upanishad. In the Upanishad, Vishnu states to Brahma that Yoga is one, in practice of various kinds, the chief are of four types Mantra Yoga is the practice through chants, Laya Yoga through deep concentration, Hatha Yoga through exertion, and Raja Yoga through meditation. There are four states which are common to all these yogas, states the text, and these four stages of attainment are Arambha beginning, the stage of practicing ethics such as non violence and proper diet, followed by asana , Ghata second integration stage to learn breath regulation and relationship between body and mind , Parichaya the third intimacy stage to hold, regulate air flow, followed by meditation for relationship between mind and Atman , and Nishpatti fourth stage to consummate Samadhi and realize Atman . The emphasis and most verses in the text are dedicated to Hatha Yoga, although the text mentions Raja yoga is the culmination of Yoga. The Mantra yoga is stated by the Yogatattva as a discipline of auditory recitation of mantras but stated to be an inferior form of yoga. It is the practice of mantra recitation or intonations of the sounds of alphabet, for 12 years. This gradually brings knowledge and special powers of inner attenuation, asserts the text. This mantra based method of yoga, asserts Yogatattva, is suited for those with dull wit and incapable of practicing the other three types of yoga. Laya yoga is presented as the discipline of dissolution where the focus is on thinking of the Lord without parts all the times while going through daily life activities. The Laya Yoga, the second in the order of importance, is oriented towards assimilation by the chitta or mind, wherein the person always thinks of formless Ishvara God . Yogatattva Upanishad 2829 The Hatha Yoga, to which Yogatattva Upanishad dedicates most of its verses, is discussed with eight interdependent practices ten yamas self restraints , ten niyamas self observances , asana postures , pranayama control of breath , pratyahara conquering the senses , dharana concentration , dhyana, and samadhi that is the state of meditative consciousness. The text discusses meditation and thereafter through verse 128, twenty stages of Hatha Yoga practice such as of Maha mudra, Maha Bandha, Khechari mudra, Mula Bandha, Uddiyana bandha, Jalandhara Bandha, Vajroli, Amaroli and Sahajoli. Thereafter, the Upanishad asserts Raja yoga to be the means for Yogin to detach himself from the world, translates Ayyangar a Sanskrit scholar. The tool for meditation, states the text, is Pranava or Om mantra, which it describes in verses 134140, followed by a statement of the nature of liberation and the ultimate truth. The Upanishad mentions many asanas, but states four postures of the yoga for the beginner commencing on pranayama breathing exercises Siddhasana, Padmasana, Simhasana and Bhadrasana. The detailed procedure and the setting for these are described in the text. Sitting in Padmasana lotus posture, the text states that the pranayama or breathing must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures matras, musical beats to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras digits , holding the air deep within for sixty four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty two Matras is suggested as the goal of the breathing exercise. Yogatattva Upanishad 6972 The Upanishad suggests breathing exercises in a variety of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis blood vessels , improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee clarified butter , cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 4649. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga. The next stage of Yoga practice, states the text, is termed Ghata Sanskrit with the goal of bringing union of Prana breath , Apana hydration and aeration of body , Manas mind and Buddhi intellect , as well as between Jivatma life soul force and Paramatman supreme soul . This practice is a step, asserts the text, for Pratyahara withdrawal from distraction by sensory organs and Dharana concentration . The aim of Dharana, states Yogatattva, is to conceive everyone and everything one perceives with any of his senses as same as his own self and soul Atman . In verses 72 to 81, the text describes a range of mystical powers that develop within those who have mastered Ghata stage of yoga. The Upanishad adds that perfection requires practice, the yogin must never revel in what he achieves, never be vain, never be distracted by trying to comply with demonstration requests, remain oblivious to others, yet be always intent on achieving the goals he sets for himself . The Upanishad, in verse 82 and onwards, elaborates on the third stage of Yogic practice, calling it the paricaya Sanskrit , intimacy state. It is the stage where the yogin awakens the Kundalini, asserts the text. Kundalini, states James Lochtefeld a professor of Religion and Asian Studies, refers to the latent spiritual power that exists in every person . The premise mentioned in Yogatattva, is also a fundamental concept in Tantra, and symbolizes an aspect of Shakti that is typically dormant in every person, and its awakening is a goal in Tantra. In Yogatattva text, this stage is described as where the Yogin's Chitta mind awakens and enters the Sushumna and the chakras. Yogatattva Upanishad 107 The five elements of Prthivi, Apas, Agni, Vayu and Akash are called as the five Brahmans corresponding to five gods within Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishvara and Sada Shiva , and reaching them is described by the text as a process of meditation. The meditation on each, asserts Yogatattva, is assisted by colors, geometry and mantras prthivi with yellow gold, quadrilateral and Lam, apas with white, crescent and Vam, agni with red, triangle and Ram, vayu with black, satkona hexagram and Yam, akash with smoke, circle and Ham. The Upanishad dedicates verses 112 through 128 on a variety of Hatha yoga asanas. The procedure and benefits of yoga practices of Sirsasana standing on the head for 24 minutes , Vajroli and Amaroli are explained briefly by the text. With these practices the Yogin attains the Raja Yoga state, realizes the facts of the life cycle of mother son wife relationship. Yogatattva Upanishad 135136 The Upanishad expounds the principles behind Om mantra as part of the yogic practice asserting that A , U and M are three letters that mirror the three Vedas, three Sandhyas morning, noon and evening , three Svaras sounds , three Agnis and three Gunas . Metaphorically this practice is compared to realizing the hidden smell of a flower, reaching the ghee clarified butter in milk, reaching the oil innate in sesame seeds, effort to extract gold from its ore, and finding the Atman in one's heart. The letter A represents the flowering of lotus, U represents the blooming of the flower, M reaches its nada tattva or truth inside, sound , and ardhamatra half metre indicates the Turiya, or bliss of silence. The Upanishad states that following the yogic practices prescribed, once the yogin has mastered the functioning of nine orifices of the body and awakened the Sushumna inwards, he awakens his Kundalini, he becomes self aware, knows the Truth and gains the conviction of his Atman. Yogatattva Upanishad 15 Sanskrit Yogatattva Upanishad is one of the most important text on Yoga. It is the Yogatattva that appears to be most minutely acquainted with yogic practices it mentions the eight angas and distinguishes the four kinds of yoga Mantra yoga, Laya yoga, Hatha yoga and Raja yoga. The text, states Whiteman, discusses a variety of Yoga systems, including the Hatha yoga, a system of practices developed intensively', with the basic objective of health and cleanliness of the physical body and perfection of voluntary control over all its functions. A notable feature of this Upanishad is definition of four types of yoga and a comparison. The Yogatattva Upanishad and the Brahma Upanishad are also known as one of the early sources of tantric ideas related to chakras, which were adopted in Tibetan Buddhism. However, states Yael Bentor, there are minor differences between the location of inner fires as described in the texts of Tibetan Buddhism and in Yogatattva text of Hinduism.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogatattva%20Upanishad
"U.S Third Fleet The attack on Yokosuka was an air raid conducted by the United States Navy on 18 July 1945 during the last weeks of the Pacific War. The Japanese battleship Nagato was the raid's main target, though anti aircraft positions and other warships at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal were also attacked. Other U.S. Navy and Royal Navy aircraft struck airfields in the Tokyo area. While Nagato was only lightly damaged, the American aircraft sank a destroyer, a submarine and two escort vessels and damaged five small vessels. The Allied pilots also claimed the destruction of several locomotives and 43 Japanese aircraft as well as damage to another 77 aircraft. Japanese anti aircraft guns shot down twelve American and two British aircraft. During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, which was led by Admiral William Halsey, conducted a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's striking force, Task Force 38 TF 38 , which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain and included nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers. On 10 July TF 38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air. No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large scale suicide attacks on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945. Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15 July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground. The American warships then sailed south and on 16 July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's BPF's main striking force, which was designated Task Force 37 TF 37 , and comprised three aircraft carriers and their escorts. By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's IJN's remaining large warships were unable to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagato's secondary armament and about half her anti aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No. 7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby in a position where she was able to protect the battleship with her 25 mm anti aircraft guns. Nagato's presence at Yokosuka was revealed to the Allies by photographs taken during the 10 July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16 July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF 37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink the remnants of the IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited. On 17 July the American and British fleet attempted to strike the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and other targets in the Tokyo area. While two waves of aircraft were dispatched, the attack was frustrated by heavy cloud over the region and further attacks were canceled. The aircraft which reached the Tokyo area struck airfields north of the city and caused little damage. While the naval base was not attacked, it was overflown by an American fighter and its defenders were readied to respond to attacks. On the night of 1718 July American and British warships bombarded the city of Hitachi. The next day, the Allied fleet sailed south looking for weather which was better suited to conducting flight operations. Conditions improved during the morning, and at 11 30 am the day's air strikes began to launch. The British aircraft of TF 37 were dispatched against airfields in the Tokyo area. The size of this attack was considerably reduced from what was planned, however, as the fuel system on board HMS Victorious had become contaminated with water and the carrier could only launch six Vought F4U Corsair fighters. TF 38's main effort was directed against Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, with Nagato being designated the raid's primary target. A smaller number of American aircraft were also dispatched to raid Japanese air fields. The attack on Yokosuka began at about 3 30 pm on 18 July. The first wave of American aircraft attacked the anti aircraft batteries around the naval base, and succeeded in neutralizing them. Following this, the aircraft of VF 88 attacked Nagato with bombs. A 500 pound general purpose bomb struck the battleship's bridge, killing her commanding officer, Rear Admiral Otsuka Miki as well as the executive officer and at least nine other men. Another 500 pound bomb later struck Nagato and detonated near her officer's mess, killing about 22 sailors and knocking out four 25 mm guns. The only other direct hit on the ship was made by a 5 inch 130 mm shell or rocket which did not explode. In addition, 60 bombs landed in the harbor near Nagato, causing breaches to her double hull which let 2,000 tons of water into the ship. By the time the attack concluded at 4 10 pm, 35 of the battleship's 967 officers and men had been killed. The overall damage to the ship was later assessed as being light. American aircraft also attacked several other ships docked at Yokosuka. The unfinished Matsu class destroyer Yaezakura broke in two and sank after being bombed, and the submarine I 372 was destroyed by another bomb at the time the submarine's crew was ashore and did not suffer any fatalities. Two escort vessels and a torpedo boat were also sunk. In addition to these losses, five other ships, including the obsolete destroyer Yakaze and training ships Fuji and Kasuga were damaged. Despite their proximity to Nagato, Fukugawa Maru No. 7 and Ushio were not damaged. The British and United States aircraft dispatched against airfields claimed to have destroyed 43 Japanese aircraft and damaged another 77. The pilots of these aircraft also claimed the destruction of several railway locomotives. Allied losses in the attacks made on 18 July were 12 U.S. Navy aircraft, two Royal Navy aircraft and 18 aircrew. The Allied pilots were disappointed they had not sunk Nagato. Following its attacks on the Tokyo Bay area on 18 July, the Allied fleet sailed away from Japan to be refueled. Its next attacks were made against the main body of the IJN in Kure and the Inland Sea on 24, 25 and 28 July. These raids sank three battleships, an aircraft carrier and several other warships but cost the Allies 133 aircraft and 102 aircrew killed. The Third Fleet and elements of the BPF continued strikes against targets in Japan until the end of the war on 15 August 1945. After the attack on Yokosuka, the Nagato's crew removed all casualties from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's ballast tanks were also flooded to give the impression that she had been sunk. During the early hours of 2 August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to be false. On 30 August the ship was surrendered to the U.S. Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28 July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 2930 July.

"United Nations The Battle of Yongdong was an engagement between United States and North Korean forces early in the Korean War. It occurred on July 2225, 1950, in the village of Yongdong in southern South Korea. The newly arrived US Army 1st Cavalry Division was ordered there to cover the retreat of the US 24th Infantry Division after the Battle of Taejon. The 1st Cavalry Division soldiers, however, were untried in combat, and the North Korean Korean People's Army's KPA 3rd Division was able to outmaneuver them and force them back. Though the Americans lost the town, their artillery inflicted substantial casualties on the North Koreans and delayed them for several crucial days, allowing the United Nations Command time to set up the Pusan Perimeter. Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the United Nations committed troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial shock of North Korean advances, delaying much larger KPA units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive. The division's delaying actions allowed the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position. Republic of Korea Army ROK forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea's east coast, with entire divisions being overrun by the KPA's superior firepower and equipment. Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and KPA forces. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the KPA's superior numbers and equipment. The division's regiments were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon and was almost completely destroyed, but delayed KPA forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's combat troops were roughly equal to KPA forces attacking the region at around 70,000 for each side, with new UN units arriving every day. On July 6, Major General Hobart R. Gay, Commanding General of the 1st Cavalry Division, was ordered by UN commander General Douglas MacArthur to prepare the 1st Cavalry Division to move into Korea. Between July 12 and 14 the division was moved from its garrisons in central Honshu, Japan and loaded onto ships in the Yokohama area. It was then ordered to land on the east coast of Korea at P'ohang dong, a fishing town 60 miles 97 km northeast of Pusan, in order to immediately reinforce the faltering 24th Infantry Division. From P'ohang dong the division could moved promptly toward the Taejon area. The command ship USS Mount McKinley and first elements of the division sailed for Korea on July 15. The 1st Cavalry Division's transportation was provided by Task Force 90, commanded by Rear Admiral James H. Doyle. Lead elements of the division's first regiment, the 8th Cavalry Regiment were ashore by 06 10 on July 18, and the first troops of the division's US 5th Cavalry Regiment came in at 06 30. Typhoon Helene swept over the Korean coast and prevented landing of the third regiment, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion until July 22. For three days ships could not be unloaded at Pusan and Eighth Army rations dropped to one day's supply. However, the landings were entirely unopposed by North Korean forces. The transfer of 750 noncommissioned officers NCOs from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It had been stripped of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 of them from the Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks. On July 19, the 5th Cavalry Regiment started toward Taejon. The next day the 8th Cavalry Regiment followed by railroad and in trucks, and reformed in an assembly area east of Yongdong that evening. Brigadier General Charles D. Palmer, the division artillery commander, took charge of these two forward regiments. On July 22 the 8th Cavalry Regiment relieved the US 24th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division from its positions at Yongdong. At that point, the 1st Cavalry Division assumed responsibility for blocking the KPA along the main TaejonTaegu corridor to Pusan. The 24th Division's troops retreated through the 1st Cavalry Division's lines as the newly arrived soldiers advanced to their new defensive positions that day. Protect Yongdong. Remember there are no friendly troops behind you. You must keep your own back door open. You can live without food but you cannot last long without ammunition, and unless the YongdongTaegu road is kept open you will soon be without ammunition. Lieutenant General Walton Walker's orders to Gay Once it was fully assembled in the city, the 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to move north of Yongdong and set up defensive positions. The division moved one battalion of the 8th Cavalry 4 miles 6.4 km northwest of Yongdong on the south side of the Kum River, and another battalion 2 miles 3.2 km southwest of Yongdong. The first would cover the approach along the main TaejonTaegu highway, the second the approach on the Chosan niMujuKumsan road. Gay placed the 5th Cavalry Regiment on the high ground east of the town in a blocking position. By July 19, the division numbered 10,027 men in Korea. This move coincided with a reorganization of the ROK consolidating their lines and making room for the new division. On July 22, the 1st Cavalry Division had finished preparing its defensive positions north of Yongdong, as the battered 24th Infantry Division was moved to the Naktong Bulge area along the Naktong River. At the same time, the 25th Infantry Division moved to Sangju where it was caught in a battle with KPA forces in that town. The KPA quickly advanced after the Battle of Taejon, with four of their divisions attacking south from the city along four different roads. The KPA 3rd Division departed the city on July 22, advancing down the main highway toward Taegu and Yongdong, to where the 1st Cavalry Division was emplaced. The next morning, July 23, the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, in front of Yongdong, reported it had destroyed three KPA T 34 tanks with 3.5 inch rocket launchers in its first use of that weapon. On July 23 the 7th and 9th Regiments of the KPA 3rd Division began their attack on the Yongdong defensive positions held by the 1st Cavalry Division. They made their first penetration southwest of Yongdong, establishing a roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, and at the same time other KPA units heavily engaged the 1st Battalion northwest of Yongdong in frontal attack. The next day, American M24 tanks attacked the roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion four times in an attempt to break it, but all were unsuccessful, and Lieutenant Colonel Eugene J. Field, the 2nd Battalion commander, was wounded at the roadblock. Palmer sent the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment and the 16th Reconnaissance Company toward the cut off battalion. By 12 00, KPA troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating that the KPA infiltration had been extensive by that point. On the other main approach to Yongdong, a road northwest of the city, heavy machine gun fire and 37 mm fire from A Battery of the 92nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion, and artillery fire from the 77th Field Artillery Battalion helped the 1st Battalion there to repel KPA attacks. However, the large numbers of civilian refugees crowding the Yongdong area trying to move south helped the KPA infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division's positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean National Police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes. The KPA continued to move into the city in civilian clothing with concealed weapons, and US troops started shooting any Koreans moving through their lines at night. The chain of command which issued these orders is not clear as they were generally not put on paper. However, these orders are thought to have contributed to war crimes committed against civilians by the 1st Cavalry Division, namely the No Gun Ri massacre, which took place around the time of the fighting at Yongdong. In the No Gun Ri incident, US soldiers are alleged to have killed a number of Korean civilians, believing them to be military infiltrators. By the morning of July 25 KPA forces had infiltrated the positions of the 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats KPA troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable. Meanwhile, the KPA intensified their attack on the 2nd Battalion on the road southwest of Yongdong. Concentrated artillery support, with the shells falling so close to the 2nd Battalion positions that they wounded four US troops, together with an attack by the 2nd Battalion, briefly opened the KPA roadblock at 04 30 July 25, and the bulk of the battalion escaped to Yongdong. However, F Company of the 8th Cavalry, the 16th Reconnaissance Company, and the 1st Platoon of A Company, 71st Tank Battalion, at the rear of the column were cut off. Only four of 11 light tanks broke through the KPA positions. Crews abandoned the other seven tanks and walked over the hills in a two days' journey as part of a group of 219 men, most of them from F Company. All equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group. Other groups of US troops escaped in the same manner. The KPA had flanked the 1st Cavalry Division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw. In the process, the division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions. On this same road, closer to Yongdong, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, which was trying to help the cutoff units of the 8th Cavalry, was itself attacked by strong KPA units. Through some error, the US battalion's F Company advanced to the wrong hill and stumbled into a concentration of KPA soldiers. Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed or captured in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25. The KPA 3rd Division used essentially the same tactics it employed against the 24th Infantry Division at Taejon against the 1st Cavalry Division at Yongdong. In both fights, the KPA opened with a direct frontal attack to hold the US division's elements in combat, and then the bulk of the KPA force enveloped the American left flank and established strongly held roadblocks behind the front positions and forced the Americans in them to retreat from the untenable positions. The KPA 3rd Division entered Yongdong the night of July 25. At least one KPA unit was in the town by 20 00. The KPA expected a counterattack and immediately took up defensive positions at the eastern edge of the town. However, the US troops had withdrawn. The 1st Cavalry Division troops set up another delaying action around Hwanggan and hit the KPA advance a second time in the Battle of Hwanggan several days later. North Korean prisoners of war captured by the US troops during the battle reported that the KPA 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 2425. This brought it down to a strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the KPA advance for several days, giving the UN forces valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit by the time it was placed on Pusan Perimeter.

"United Nations 187 Airborne RCT 27th Com Bde The Battle of Yongju, also known as the Battle of the Apple Orchard, took place from 21 to 22 October 1950 as part of the United Nations Command UN offensive towards the Yalu River, against the North Korean forces which had invaded South Korea during the Korean War. The battle was fought between the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and the Korean People's Army KPA 239th Regiment which was encircled east of Yongju, where it was attacking the US US 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team 187 RCT . On 20 October the 187 RCT had parachuted ahead of the advancing UN spearheads into drop zones in Sukchon and Sunchon, 40 kilometres 25 mi north of the capital Pyongyang, with the objectives of cutting off the retreating KPA forces that were withdrawing up the west coast of the Korean Peninsula and releasing US and South Korean prisoners of war. Although the airborne drop itself was a success, the operation came too late to intercept any significant KPA elements and the US landings initially met little resistance. However, on 21 October as the 187 RCT began to advance south to the clear the Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang they came under heavy attack from the KPA 239th Regiment, and requested assistance. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was leading the US Eighth Army general advance, was subsequently ordered forward to assist the 187 RCT. The British and Australians crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, and moved north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task of reaching the Chongchon River. The 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment 1 ASHR , subsequently pushed up the road until fired upon by KPA forces in the hills to the south of Yongju. By nightfall the hills were cleared by the Argylls, while the 3rd Battalion, 187 RCT occupied Yongju. Cut off, about midnight the KPA 239th Regiment attempted to break out, resulting in heavy fighting. The KPA attacks drove the 187 RCT from Yongju, forcing them back onto the battalion's main defensive position to the north. 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment 3 RAR was ordered to take the lead the following morning. By dawn the Americans again requested assistance. At first light on 22 October, two companies of Argylls advanced into Yongju, before the Australians passed through them riding on US M4 Sherman tanks. Now leading the brigade, at 09 00 the Australians came under fire from a KPA rearguard position in an apple orchard on their right flank. An encounter battle developed as 3 RAR carried out an aggressive quick attack off the line of march from the road, with US tanks in support. Despite fire support from mortars and artillery being unavailable due to the location of the 3 187 RCT being unknown, the Australian attack succeeded and the KPA were forced to withdraw from the high ground, having suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, 3 RAR's tactical headquarters came under attack and was forced to fight off a group of KPA. Having been forced off the high ground, the KPA were now caught between the advancing Australians and the 187 RCT to the north. Attacking the KPA from the rear, 3 RAR subsequently relieved the 187 RCT, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade linked up with them by 11 00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday however, many of the KPA that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. The Australians then proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the KPA soldiers they found hiding in them as they attempted to flee. The KPA 239th Regiment was practically destroyed.

Numerically superior and better equipped, the KPA crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming the inferior Republic of Korea Army ROK . In response, the United Nations decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the South Koreans from collapsing, however they too were understrength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the KPA to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter. Key US alliesBritain, Canada and Australiaalso committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces. Australia was one of the first nations to commit units to the fighting, playing a small but sometimes significant part in the UN effort, which was initially led by General Douglas MacArthur. Forces deployed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force formed the basis of the Australian response, with P 51 Mustang fighter bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF flying their first missions on 2 July, while the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven and the destroyer HMAS Bataan were also committed to naval operations. During this time the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment 3 RAR , which had been preparing to return to Australia prior to the outbreak of the war, remained in Japan, however on 26 July the Australian government announced that it would also commit the under strength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to the fighting, following a period of preparation. Training and re equipment began immediately, while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in Australia as part of K Force they soon began arriving to fill out the battalion. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh, was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green. An officer with extensive operational experience fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, Green took over from Walsh due to the latter's perceived inexperience. On 23 September 1950, 3 RAR embarked for Korea, concentrating at Pusan on 28 September. There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade, a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker. Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad, the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment 1 ASHR , the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment 1 MR and 3 RAR. Understrength, the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks, while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment, and had no integral artillery support, for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951. As such, with a strength of nearly 1,000 men, the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment, rather than being attached to a US formation. Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units, including 155 mm howitzers from the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion, M4 Sherman tanks from the US 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the US 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion. By the time 3 RAR arrived in the theatre, the North Koreans had been broken and were in rapid retreat, with MacArthur's forces conducting a successful amphibious assault at Inchon and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula. A steady advance began, driving the North Koreans northwards towards the 38th Parallel. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was airlifted from Taegu to Kimpo Airfield north of Seoul on 5 October, however its vehicles had to move by road, driving 420 kilometres 260 mi , and did not arrive until 9 October. It was subsequently attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division, under the command of Major General Hobart R. Gay. On 16 October the brigade took over from the US 7th Cavalry Regiment as the vanguard of the UN advance into North Korea, its axis intended to take it through Kaesong, Kumchon and Hungsu ri to Sariwon, then through Hwangju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Although the North Koreans had suffered heavily in the preceding weeks, they continued to resist strongly, while a lack of accurate maps and the narrowness of the roads made rapid movement difficult for the advancing UN forces. During this time 3 RAR had a platoon of US M4 Sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in direct support. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade subsequently moved 70 kilometres 43 mi from Kumchon, with the Argylls capturing Sariwon, an industrial town 54 kilometres 34 mi south of Pyongyang, on 17 October. Supported by 3 RAR and US tanks, the Highlanders killed 215 KPA and took several thousand prisoners for the loss of one man killed and three wounded in a one sided action. Prior to the attack the Australians had moved through the town to establish a blocking position 8 kilometres 5.0 mi to the north. During the evening 3 RAR encountered a KPA force withdrawing north. Using the same road and moving in the same direction, the KPA mistook the Australians and Argylls for Russians in the poor light and were bluffed into surrendering, with the Australians capturing thousands of KPA and their weapons and equipment following a brief exchange. Mounted on a tank, the 3 RAR second in command, Major Ian Ferguson, captured over 1,600 KPA soldiers with just an interpreter. Australian involvement had been limited, however, and they regarded their first exposure to the fighting in Korea as a relatively minor incident. Pyongyang fell to US and South Korean troops on 19 October. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade then passed to the command of the US 24th Infantry Division on 21 October, under the overall command of Major General John H. Church, while the US 1st Cavalry Division remained in Pyongyang to complete its capture. Coad had hoped to rest his men at Pyongyang however, the advance continued north with little respite and the brigade moved through the village of Sangapo. The British and Australians were subsequently ordered to seize Chongju. The previous day the 187 RCT had parachuted ahead of the advancing UN spearheads into drop zones around Sukchon and Sunchon, 40 kilometres 25 mi north of the capital. Commanded by Colonel Frank S. Bowen, the paratroopers were tasked with the objectives of cutting off the retreating KPA forces that were withdrawing up the west coast of the Korean Peninsula and releasing US and South Korean prisoners of war. The plan envisioned the 1st and 3rd Battalions, 187th RCT dropping southeast of Sukchon to seize the town, before establishing blocking positions on the two main highways and the railway to Pyongyang. The 2nd Battalion, 187 RCT would then be dropped near Sunchon, 24 kilometres 15 mi to the east to block another highway and railway line. The US paratroopers would then hold their positions while the US Eighth Army pushed northwards to link up with them, a task which was expected to be complete within two days. US intelligence indicated that a trainload of US prisoners of war was moving north by night from Pyongyang, and Bowen hoped to intercept their train and release the men. As the Eighth Army crossed the 38th Parallel MacArthur had held 187th RCT at Kimpo Airfield near Seoul as the theatre reserve, with the intent of using them as a blocking force to prevent the anticipated KPA withdrawal. Yet anxious not to expose the lightly equipped paratroopers by projecting them too far forward of the advance, MacArthur kept them back, and after changing the date twice, they were not dropped until 20 October. By this time the bulk of the KPA had succeeded in withdrawing safely behind the Chongchon River. Only the KPA 239th Regiment remained, having been ordered to delay the UN forces as they attempted to follow up. With a strength of 2,500 men the regiment subsequently occupied positions on the high ground astride the road and rail lines east of Yongju, 12 kilometres 7.5 mi south of the US drop zones at Sukchon. Beginning at 14 00 on 20 October, 1,470 men from Lieutenant Colonel Harry Wilson's 1 187 RCT, Regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company, as well as supporting engineer, medical and logistic elements, were flown by C 119 Flying Boxcar and C 47 Skytrain transport aircraft from Kimpo Airfield. After forming up over the Han River, the force was parachuted into a drop zone southeast of Sukchondesignated Drop Zone Williamsupported by US fighter aircraft which rocketed and strafed the ground in preparation for the landing. The Americans subsequently met occasional sniper fire, experiencing only limited resistance. US casualties included 25 men injured in the jump, while one group which landed 2.4 kilometres 1.5 mi east of the drop zone lost a man killed in his parachute after being attacked by the KPA. The heavy equipment subsequently followed the initial airdrop, including seven 105 mm M2A1 howitzers and their ammunition from A and C Battery, 674th Field Artillery Battalion. One of the guns was damaged in the drop, however, and was unable to be used. 1 187 RCT subsequently moved west, capturing Hill 97 east of Sukchon and Hill 104 to the north, before clearing the town itself and setting up a roadblock. Wilson dispatched patrols to the river in the vicinity of Naeman ni, and prepared to move south towards Pyongyang. A platoon of engineers reached Songnani ni at 15 30 but was delayed for 45 minutes by KPA fire. Capturing 15 prisoners, the platoon then moved to Namil ni where it was further engaged, killing five KPA and capturing another 16. Meanwhile, Bowen established his command post at Chany ni on Hill 97, along the dykes of the Choeyong River, and was dug in by 16 00. 3 187th RCTunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Delbert Munsonjumped into Drop Zone William shortly afterwards, before turning south and adopting a defensive position on the low hills 3 kilometres 1.9 mi south of Sukchon, where they established roadblocks across the highway and railway. Seizing their objectives by 17 00, the US paratroopers killed five KPA and captured 42 others without loss. Preparing to attack south along the railway and highway, Munson subsequently dispersed his battalion along the high ground south of Sukchon, with Company I on the left and Company K on the right, where they set up a blocking position on the SukchonPyongyang Road. 2 187 RCTunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. Boylejumped into Drop Zone Easy, 3 kilometres 1.9 mi southwest of Sunchon at 14 20 and although the battalion suffered 20 men injured in the drop, it secured its objectives by nightfall almost unopposed. B Battery, US 674th Field Artillery Battalion was also dropped in support. Two companies then established roadblocks to the south and west of the town, while a third company married up with elements of the ROK 6th Infantry Division at Sunchon, which was pushing towards the Chongchon River. MacArthur had flown from Japan to watch the drop from the air, and after observing the landing aboard a US bomber accompanied by a number of war correspondents, he subsequently flew to Pyongyang where he announced to the press that the operation had achieved complete surprise. Estimating that 30,000 KPA troopsperhaps half of those remaining in North Koreahad been caught between the 187 RCT in the north and the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Infantry Division to the south at Pyongyang, he predicted that they would soon be destroyed or captured by the UN advance. Yet, while the air drop itself had been a success, despite MacArthur's optimistic predictions the operation came too late to intercept any significant KPA elements and the US landings initially met little resistance. Indeed, most of the KPA had succeeded in withdrawing north, and had crossed the Chongchon River, or were in the process of doing so, while the government and most important officials had moved to Kanggye in the mountains 32 kilometres 20 mi southeast of Manpojin on the Yalu River. Most of the US and ROK prisoners had also been moved to more remote parts of North Korea, and were unable to be rescued. In total, during the operation approximately 4,000 men and more than 600 tons of equipment and supplies were dropped by the Americans at Sukchon and Sunchon on 20 October and the days that followed, including twelve 105 mm howitzers, 39 jeeps, 38 1 4 ton trailers, four 90 mm antiaircraft guns, four 3 4 ton trucks, as well as ammunition, fuel, water, rations, and other supplies. Although sound in concept, the operation may have had more chance of success had a complete airborne division been employed. The following morning 1 187 RCT captured the high ground north of Sukchon and established a blocking position on the main highway running north. However, strong KPA rearguard forces held the next line of hills to the north. While at Sunchon, 2 187 RCT had heard reports that a number of US prisoners had been murdered nearby by their North Korean captors as the KPA retreated. It became apparent that the train carrying the prisoners north from Pyongyang had halted in a railway tunnel on the 20th to conceal itself as 187 RCT jumped into the area, and that while there, many of the men aboard had been shot by the KPA guards them as they waited for their evening meal. Sixty six bodies were later recovered, as well as those of seven more who were found to have died of disease or malnutrition. Twenty three starving and emaciated US survivors were found nearby however, many were badly wounded and two later died. The US paratroopers were subsequently ordered to return to Pyongyang. At 09 00 on 21 October, 3 187 RCT began to advance south to clear the Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang. The US paratroopers advanced on two fronts, with I Company moving along the railway line and K Company along the highway. At 13 00 I Company reached Opa ri, where it encountered a strong KPA force estimated as a battalion, equipped with 120 mm mortars and 40 mm guns. I Company was caught in an ambush. The KPA subsequently attacked the paratroopers and after a battle lasting two and a half hours, they overran two US platoons. I Company was forced to withdraw west of the railway to Hill 281 having suffered 90 men missing. Despite their success, the KPA subsequently withdrew to their own defensive positions in the high ground around Opa ri. Amid the fighting, a US medic attached to I Company, Private First Class Richard G. Wilson, was killed while attempting to reach a wounded man who had been left behind, and he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Wilson had repeatedly exposed himself to KPA fire to render aid to the wounded, and later helped many to safety following the order to withdraw. On hearing that one of the Americans previously thought to be dead had been seen attempting to crawl to safety, he went back to the battlefield to search for him and had disappeared. Two days later a patrol found Wilson lying dead beside the man he had returned to rescue, having been shot while trying to shield him from further injury. Meanwhile, during its advance along the highway, K Company encountered a battalion sized KPA force, 1.6 kilometres 0.99 mi north of Yongju. Following a sharp fight the Americans forced the KPA to withdraw to defensive positions on the high ground to the south and east of the town, as K Company continued into Yongju, where they established a position on Hill 163, immediately to the north, digging in. The distance separating the highway and the railway which ran north either side of Yongju was larger at that point than anywhere else between Pyongyang and Sukchon. The US companies now occupied positions roughly opposite each otherat Yongju on the highway and Opa ri on the railwayyet these positions were now almost 5 kilometres 3.1 mi apart and they were unable to mutually support each other. Elsewhere, elements of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 187 RCT successfully linked up at Sunchon that afternoon. The KPA 239th Regiment had subsequently established defensive positions on a line of hills extending southwest to northeast across the highway at Yongju and the railway at Opa ri, on ground which offered the best defensive terrain between the capital and the Chongchon River. The last KPA unit to leave Pyongyang, the Regiment had been tasked with fighting a delaying action against UN troops as they advanced north. Yet as a result of the unexpected US airborne assault, the KPA 239th Regiment was subsequently encircled and found itself unexpectedly attacked from the rear. Already under threat from the UN advance north from Pyongyang, the KPA subsequently reacted vigorously to the Americans as 3 187 RCT began to move south, and heavy fighting ensued 3 kilometres 1.9 mi north of Yongju. The US paratroopers subsequently requested assistance from the US 24th Infantry Division, to which it was temporarily attached. Meanwhile, as the fighting at Yongju continued, 2 187 RCT had remained out of contact at its drop zone at Sunchon as the ROK 6th Division completed the clearance of the town and its surrounds of KPA stragglers. In the days prior, US I Corps had continued its movement northward as part of the general advance of the US Eighth Army. Following the capture of Pyongyang, the corps commander, Major General Frank W. Milburn, ordered the advance to continue to the MacArthur Line, running approximately 35 kilometres 22 mi south of the Yalu River. The US 24th Division, to which the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was then attached, was ordered to lead this attack. On the division's right flank three ROK divisions, the ROK 1st Division, under US I Corps, and the ROK 6th and 8th Divisions under the control of ROK II Corps, were deployed to the east and would also be committed to the attack northwards. The British and Australians had covered 122 kilometres 76 mi in the previous two days, advancing rapidly until slowed by rain. A Company, 3 RAR was subsequently engaged by snipers from a nearby village without suffering casualties. The Sherman tanks proceeded to heavily engage the KPA positions in the village, which was then cleared by the Australian infantry who killed five KPA and took three prisoners. As the rain ceased a KPA T 34 tank, which had remained concealed during the earlier fighting, engaged D Company, 3 RAR and was subsequently knocked out by the US tanks. An unmanned SU 76 self propelled gun was also located nearby, and neither it nor the tank were found to have any petrol. Meanwhile, 187 RCT's request for reinforcement had been received by the headquarters of the US 24th Infantry Division in Pyongyang. Yet, with the US division still well to the rear, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was the closest formation, and it was subsequently ordered forward to assist the US paratroopers. Now the vanguard of the Eighth Army, the British and Australians crossed the Taedong River using a sand bag bridge at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, moving north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task of reaching the Chongchon River. Meanwhile, elements of 3 187 RCT occupied Yongju. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Nielson, 1 ASHR subsequently pushed up the road until fired upon by KPA forces in the hills to the south of the town, with snipers engaging the column as it turned west out of the river valley around 16 00. Encountering only light resistance from a small KPA force of approximately 75 men which was then scattered by tank fire, the Argylls successfully cleared the foothills by last light on 21 October. Approaching Yongju, Coad decided to halt for the night. The Argylls subsequently sent a patrol into the town, establishing initial contact with 3 187 RCT, marrying up with K Company which was established in a number of houses on the northern edge of Yongju and on Hill 163 immediately above their position. A strong KPA force was believed to be nearby, however, with at least 300 men thought to remain in the town. Cut off, about midnight the KPA 239th Regiment attempted to break out to the north, launching a number of attacks against the Americans. During the first attack a small group of KPA succeeded in infiltrating the K Company command post at Yongju. In the close quarter fighting that ensured Captain Claude K. Josey, the US company commander, tackled a KPA machine gunner, and despite being wounded twice he succeeded in disarming him before collapsing from his injuries. Josey was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. As the fighting continued the K Company executive officer was also wounded, yet the Americans eventually drove off the KPA, many of whom were subsequently killed. Nearby, the British and Australians could hear the sounds of heavy fighting between the Americans and KPA 1.6 to 3.2 kilometres 1 to 2 mi to the north. Half an hour later a small group of KPA attacked A Company, 1 ASHR with grenades, killing two men and wounding two more before being repulsed having suffered one killed and one wounded. A large concentration of around 300 KPA were subsequently observed assembling in Yongju by the K Company forward observer, however the US artillery had relocated during the fighting and was unable to engage the target. Two guns from C Battery, 674th Artillery Battalion were ordered to reposition south of Sukchon to support 3 187 RCT. Following two more KPA attacks the Americans near Hill 163 were forced to abandon the roadblock after running out of ammunition. Detecting the withdrawal, the KPA attacked again at 04 00. Meanwhile, after forcing their way through heavy KPA machine gun and rifle fire the two US howitzers were successfully redeployed, coming into action at 04 15. To the south, the British and Australians could hear the sounds of renewed fighting, and they began to fear that the Americans had been overrun. The KPA attacks drove K Company from Yongju that night, forcing them back towards the battalion's main defensive position 3.2 kilometres 2.0 mi to the north. Yet the paratroopers managed to reform into a tight perimeter on the northern edge of Yongju. Renewing their attack at 05 45, the KPA then assaulted the command post of 3 187 RCT and the L Company perimeter, but suffered heavy casualties from US enfilade and direct fire. During this action a column of KPA had moved towards L Company just before daybreak, singing as they approached. Dug in on the forward slopes facing the road, the 3 Platoon position gave the Americans a good field of fire overlooking the rice paddies and they began to engage the KPA with machine guns. Meanwhile, 1 Platoon and Company Headquarters also began to fire in support. Yet in the darkness the attackers claimed to be ROK and the Americans subsequently held their fire until the light became sufficient to confirm their identity. An US 57 mm recoilless rifle subsequently destroyed a KPA truck at the head of another column as it moved up the road. The KPA then attempted to move a machine gun forward, but were thwarted as the Americans killed a number of men and took over the weapon. Under heavy fire the KPA attack was broken up, with many of the survivors attempting to take cover behind the raised road. Meanwhile, the howitzers had continued to support the paratroopers, and by 05 50 the two guns had fired 145 rounds. During a single fire mission 54 KPA were killed, while by the time 3 187 RCT was finally relieved later that day C Battery, 674th Artillery Battalion had accounted for more than 200 KPA. In spite of these losses the KPA assaulted the US positions again, with a force of 300 men falling on L Company and a further 450 men assaulting Headquarters Company. At the bottom of the slope the KPA knocked out a US machine gun, hitting three of the crew in quick succession. The Americans responded with .50 caliber heavy machine guns, while a 3.5 inch bazooka engaged the KPA in a culvert as they attempted to overrun the L Company position. Master Sergeant Willard W. Ryals subsequently moved forward down the hill under heavy fire to man the now silenced machine gun, and proceeded to engage the attackers. For his actions he was later awarded the US Silver Star. Hard pressed, the beleaguered Americans again requested assistance. Overnight Coad had ordered 3 RAR to take the lead the following morning and Green subsequently decided to send a company through Yongju to advance north as rapidly as possible, intending to push through the Argylls which were tasked with clearing the town. By dawn, the KPA and Americans had fought each other to a standstill after heavy fighting overnight and the previous day the KPA 239th Regiment was almost exhausted, yet, in danger of being destroyed, it prepared for a final attempt to break out. At first light on 22 October, A and C Company, 1 ASHR advanced into Yongju, before the Australians passed through them. Elsewhere, the Middlesex battalion took up defensive positions to the north of Yongju. The Argylls then moved through the town, using high explosive and white phosphorus grenades to flush out the remaining KPA snipers, setting fire to many of the buildings. As planned, at 07 00, 3 RAR was ordered to move through Yongju towards Sukchon to link up with 187 RCT and close the gap between the two forces. C Company, 3 RAR under Captain Archer Denness subsequently passed through the burning town mounted on M4 Sherman tanks from D Company, 89th Tank Battalion. Now leading the brigade, at 09 00 the Australians came under small arms and light mortar fire from a KPA rearguard position in an apple orchard on their right flank, having moved just 1.5 kilometres 0.93 mi . The Australians had driven into the rear of the KPA 239th Regiment as it was forming up for a final assault on 3 187 RCT. The strong KPA force of approximately 1,000 men subsequently allowed C Company, 3 RAR and the battalion's tactical headquarters group to pass before engaging them. The KPA held features lay between the advancing Australians and the US paratroopers, blocking any relief attempt. Yet rather than preparing a deliberate attack and potentially allowing the KPA time to organise their defences, Green chose to force his leading company through at once in order to seize the initiative and continue the pursuit. An encounter battle developed as 3 RAR carried out an aggressive quick attack from the road, with US tanks in support. Preparing for the assault, Green informed brigade headquarters of his plans and was advised that 187 RCT was believed to be about 1,500 metres 1,600 yd further north however, as the exact location of the Americans was unclear the indirect fire available to support the attack would be limited. The US tanks were also initially under orders not to fire for fear of hitting their own men. With mortars and artillery unavailable the Australians proceeded to attack regardless, with the tanks carrying C Company turning east towards the KPA positions in the apple orchard. 7 and 8 Platoons were subsequently committed to the attack, while 9 Platooncommanded by Lieutenant David Butlerwas left near the road to protect the Australian flank. Supported by 18 Sherman tanks, the Australians dismounted close to their objective, charging the position with bayonets, Bren light machine guns, Owen guns, rifles and grenades as the tanks opened up with their main armament and machine guns. In the face of this determined attack many of the KPA left their pits in an attempt to move to safety, only to suffer heavy casualties after exposing themselves to the fire of the two assaulting platoons and the US tanks and flanking platoon in support. The speed and ferocity of the attack surprised the defenders, and the Australians quickly overcame the KPA outposts despite the lack of indirect fires. The KPA, many of whom were recently trained conscripts, were then forced to withdraw for the loss of only four Australians wounded. For his leadership in co ordinating the assault Denness was later awarded the Military Cross, while Private Charles McMurray received the Military Medal for bravery. More than 70 KPA were killed in the initial attack, while a further eight or nine were killed as the Australians cleared the position, setting fire to the KPA dug outs and forcing the remaining defenders to flee. As the KPA broke, Green pushed A and B Company onto the higher ground to the right of C Company with the intention of clearing the ridge overlooking the highway, while D Company moved forward on the left of the road towards 9 Platoon. Meanwhile, the battalion tactical headquarters, which had followed closely behind C Company as they assaulted, came under attack in the apple orchard east of the road and was forced to fight off a group of KPA, with the regimental police and the battalion signallers fighting back to back to defend themselves. Withstanding the attack, the Australians eventually killed 34 KPA for the loss of three men wounded. Yet despite becoming personally involved in the heavy fighting, Green continued to skilfully control the battle throughout. D Company was subsequently ordered to clear the KPA threatening battalion headquarters, as well as sending a platoon forward to re establish contact with the Americans. Running low on ammunition, 3 187 RCT had been in contact throughout the morning and continued to suffer casualties. However, having been forced off the high ground, the KPA were now caught between the advancing Australians and the US paratroopers to the north. Unable to move north, the KPA attempted to breakout across the open rice fields to the west, through the gap between the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and 187 RCT. The KPA again suffered heavy casualties, with many cut down by tank and rifle fire from C Company, 3 RAR. Some of the survivors took refuge among a number of haystacks and rice stooks in front of 9 Platoon, from where they engaged the Australians with sniper fire. Others fled east, escaping to the higher ground where they dispersed. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently ordered to clear pockets of resistance remaining within the battalion position. Meanwhile, the Middlesex battalion passed through the Australians and, with the tanks, linked up with 187 RCT at 11 00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday however, many of the KPA that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. After clearing their objectives 7 and 8 Platoon had moved forward towards 9 Platoon, which then clashed with a number of KPA stragglers in the paddy fields. C Company, 3 RAR subsequently deployed in an extended line and a substantial action soon developed. In a scene Coad later likened to driving snipe, the Australians subsequently proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the KPA soldiers they found hiding in them as they attempted to flee. For his leadership Butler was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star, while Private John Cousins received the US Bronze Star for his role in the action. Despite the uncertain situation and the lack of indirect support, Green's tactical handling of the Australian battalion had been bold, and his decision to move quickly through Yongju and to attack off the line of march proved decisive. Preoccupied with fighting the Americans to their north, the KPA were unprepared for the Australians to attack from the rear. Caught between the US paratroopers and the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, the KPA 239th Regiment was practically destroyed. KPA casualties in the apple orchard were 150 killed, 239 wounded and 200 captured, while Australian casualties numbered just seven men wounded. Including those engaged by the Argylls, total KPA losses during the fighting with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade exceeded 200 killed and 500 captured. The survivors subsequently fled westwards. In their first major battle in Korea the Australians had distinguished themselves, and the battalion was later praised for its performance. The action became known as the Battle of the Apple Orchard , while the Royal Australian Regiment was later granted the battle honour Yongju . Boosting their confidence, the success prepared the Australians for the battles which they were to face in the months that followed. Meanwhile, 3 187 RCT reported killing 805 KPA and capturing 681 in the fighting around Yongju. Altogether, US casualties during the Sukchon Sunchon operation were 48 killed in action and 80 wounded, and a further one killed and 56 injured in the jump. 3 187 RCT and the 2nd Section, Antitank Gun Platoon, Support Company were both awarded the US Distinguished Unit Citation. That afternoon 3 187 RCT returned to Sukchon. The Middlesex battalion was subsequently ordered to push on to Sukchon, and after successfully relieving the Americans in place by nightfall, the battalion occupied a defensive position 1.6 kilometres 0.99 mi north. 187 RCT returned to Pyongyang by road on 23 October, moving through Sunchon. Shortly after they went back into theatre reserve. Meanwhile, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and US 24th Division continued their advance up the highway. Intending to defeat the KPA and bring the war to a close, the UN forces pushed towards the Yalu River, on the Chinese border. However, resistance continued to be met as the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade crossed the Chongchon River, and they now moved towards Pakchon. On 24 October, MacArthur had removed all restrictions on the movement of his forces south of the Yalu River and prepared for the final phase of the UN advance, defying a directive of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and risking Chinese intervention on behalf of North Korea. An intense period of fighting followed and the Australians were involved in a number of major battles over the coming days. On the afternoon of 25 October a platoon from 3 RAR was fired on by two companies of KPA as they crossed the Taeryong River to conduct a reconnaissance of the west bank, and although they were subsequently forced to withdraw, the Australians took 10 prisoners with them. Acting as the forward elements of the brigade, that evening Green sent two companies across the river to establish defensive positions, and they subsequently broke up a frontal assault on their positions with mortars while the KPA were in the process of forming up. Sixty KPA supported by a T 34 tank then attacked the forward Australian companies at Kujin early the following morning, resulting in Australian losses of eight killed and 22 wounded. However, the KPA suffered heavy casualties including over 100 killed and 350 captured, and the Australians subsequently succeeded in defending the bridgehead after the KPA withdrew. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the KPA 17th Tank Brigade, which was preparing a last line of defence at Chongju, 70 kilometres 43 mi away. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the KPA towards Chongju however, the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance as they approached the Manchurian border.

"United Nations The Battle of Yongsan was an engagement between United Nations Command UN and North Korean forces early in the Korean War from September 15, 1950, at Yongsan in South Korea. It was part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army US repelled a strong Korean People's Army KPA attack. During the nearby Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA broke through the US 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the KPA 9th and 4th Divisions attacked to Yongsan, a village east of the river and the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between KPA and US forces for Yongsan. The KPA were able to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the penetrations at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing the danger of the attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days of fierce fighting, the Army and Marine forces were able to push the KPA out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge. From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army ROK and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA tactics were to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used these tactics to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division, engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang dong during the Battle of P'ohang dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their tactics were not working. In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it this was considered to be the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware of the UN forces building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that they must conduct an offensive soon or they could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 9th, 4th, 2nd and 10th Divisions to break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan. On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the KPA 9th Division, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the US line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong. As the KPA 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76 mm artillery battalion from the KPA I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the KPA 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured KPA document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of KPA I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1. On the morning of September 1, with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, moved to the south side of the Yongsan Naktong River road D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road. Approximately 2 miles 3.2 km west of Yongsan an estimated 300 KPA troops engaged A Company in a fire fight. M19 Gun Motor Carriages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action, which lasted several hours. Meanwhile, with the approval of the Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking Yongsan. A platoon of infantry went into position behind it. A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Yongsan on the left flank of D Company. There, A Company went into position along the road on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion, and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company. The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. The KPA had also approached Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in an intense fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven KPA machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy KPA fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, remained on the tank until he was killed. That night KPA soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south. The KPA now attempted a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, they were unable to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11 00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5 inch and old 2.36 inch rocket launchers Bazookas against the KPA infantry. The fire of the 18 Bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the KPA, who desperately tried to clear the way for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with KPA dead and destroyed equipment. While this battle raged during the morning at Yongsan, commanders reorganized about 800 men of the 9th Infantry who had arrived in that vicinity from the overrun river line positions. Among them were F and G Companies, which were not in the path of major KPA crossings and had succeeded in withdrawing eastward. They had no crew served weapons or heavy equipment. In midafternoon September 2, tanks and the reorganized US 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, attacked through A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, into Yongsan, and regained possession of the town at 15 00. Later, two Bazooka teams from A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, knocked out three T 34 tanks just west of Yongsan. US ground and air action destroyed other KPA tanks during the day southwest of the town. By evening the KPA had been driven into the hills westward. In the evening, the 2nd Battalion and A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, occupied the first chain of low hills 0.5 miles 0.80 km beyond Yongsan, the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town. For the time being at least, the KPA drive toward Miryang had been halted. In this time, the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean Augmentees KATUSAs However, the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions. At 09 35 September 2, while the KPA were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that UN commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13 15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the KPA east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished. A conference was held that afternoon at the US 2nd Division command post attended by leaders of the Eighth Army, US 2nd Division, and 1st Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08 00 on September 3 astride the Yongsan Naktong River road the 9th Infantry, B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and D Battery of the 82d AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry Regiment the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division. Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan ni area, 8 miles 13 km south of Miryang and 15 miles 24 km east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River. There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone. The troops holding this line on the first hills west of Yongsan were G Company, 9th Infantry, north of the road running west through Kogan ni to the Naktong A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, southward across the road and, below the engineers, F Company, 9th Infantry. Between 03 00 and 04 30 September 3, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines south of it. The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction. During the night, A Company of the engineers had considerable fighting with KPA and never reached its objective. At dawn September 3, A Company attacked to gain the high ground which was part of the designated Marine line of departure. The company fought its way up the slope to within 100 yards 91 m of the top, which was held by the firmly entrenched KPA. At this point the company commander caught a KPA thrown grenade and was wounded by its fragments as he tried to throw it away from his men. The company with help from Marine tank fire eventually gained its objective, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack. The Marine attack started at 08 55 across the rice paddy land toward KPA held high ground 0.5 miles 0.80 km westward. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, south of the east west road, gained its objective when KPA soldiers broke under air attack and ran down the northern slope and crossed the road to Hill 116 in the 2nd Battalion zone. Air strikes, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught KPA reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion advanced to Hill 91. North of the road the 2nd Battalion had a harder time, encountering heavy KPA fire when it reached the northern tip of Hill 116, 2 miles 3.2 km west of Yongsan. The KPA held the hill during the day, and at night D Company of the 5th Marines was isolated there. In the fighting west of Yongsan Marine armor knocked out four T 34 tanks, and KPA crew members abandoned a fifth. That night the Marines dug in on a line 2 miles 3.2 km west of Yongsan. The 2nd Battalion had lost 18 killed and 77 wounded during the day, most of them in D Company. Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north. Just before midnight, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, received orders to pass through the 2nd Battalion and continue the attack in the morning. That night torrential rains made the troops miserable and lowered morale. The KPA were unusually quiet and launched few patrols or attacks. The morning of September 4, the weather was clear. The counterattack continued at 08 00 September 4, at first against little opposition. North of the road the 2nd Battalion quickly completed occupation of Hill 116, from which the KPA had withdrawn during the night. South of the road the 1st Battalion occupied what appeared to be a command post of the KPA 9th Division. Tents were still up and equipment lay scattered about. Two abandoned T 34 tanks in excellent condition stood there. Tanks and ground troops advancing along the road found it littered with KPA dead and destroyed and abandoned equipment. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another 3 miles 4.8 km . That night was quiet until just before dawn. The KPA then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the Marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling KPA force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close up KPA positions and, in hand to hand fighting, he bayoneted four more KPA soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed a mortar crew. US artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the KPA in this night and day battle. That morning, September 5, after a 10 minute artillery preparation, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see KPA troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the KPA held high ground. At 14 30 approximately 300 KPA infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T 34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5 inch Bazookas rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The KPA infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and Marine 81 mm mortars helped repel it. September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded, and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed, 91 wounded, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total American battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men. It is unknown how many KPA were killed or wounded on that day, but they likely suffered heavy casualties. During the previous night, at 20 00 September 4, General Walker had ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea if he were to stop the KPA offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00 15, September 6, the Marines began leaving their lines at Obong ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the US 17th Infantry Regiment and later the US 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold. The American counteroffensive of September 35 west of Yongsan, according to prisoner statements, resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a KPA division. Even though remnants of the KPA 9th Division, supported by the low strength KPA 4th Division, still held Obong ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack. The KPA 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive. The KPA 4th and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the KPA troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of KPA casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat. The US casualty count at Yongsan is also difficult to know, as the division's scattered units were engaged all along the Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan. Once again the fatal weakness of the KPA had cost it victory after an impressive initial success its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the KPA attacks in the area had been repulsed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Yongsan
"SMS Yorck His Majesty's Ship Yorck was the second and final member of the Roon class of armored cruisers built for the German Kaiserliche Marine Imperial Navy as part of a major naval expansion program aimed at strengthening the fleet. Yorck was named for Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, a Prussian field marshal. She was laid down in 1903 at the Blohm Voss shipyard in Hamburg, launched in May 1904, and commissioned in November 1905. The ship was armed with a main battery of four 21 cm 8.3 in guns and had a top speed was 20.4 knots 37.8 km h 23.5 mph . Like many of the late armored cruisers, Yorck was quickly rendered obsolescent by the advent of the battlecruiser as a result, her career was limited. Yorck spent the first seven years of her career in I Scouting Group, the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet, initially as the group flagship. During this period, the ship was occupied with training exercises and made several cruises in the Atlantic Ocean. Yorck was involved in a number of accidents, including an accidental explosion aboard the ship in 1911 and a collision with a torpedo boat in 1913. In May 1913, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She was thereafter mobilized and assigned to III Scouting Group. On 3 November, she formed part of the screen for the High Seas Fleet as it sailed to support a German raid on Yarmouth on the return of the fleet to Wilhelmshaven, the ships encountered heavy fog and anchored in the Schillig Roads to await better visibility. Believing the fog to have cleared sufficiently, the ship's commander ordered Yorck to get underway in the early hours of 4 November. The ship entered a German minefield in the haze, struck two mines, and sank with heavy loss of life. The wreck was dismantled progressively between the 1920s and 1980s to reduce the navigational hazard it posed. The two Roon class cruisers were ordered in 1902 as part of the fleet expansion program specified by the Second Naval Law of 1900. The two ships were incremental developments of the preceding Prinz Adalbert class cruisers, the most significant difference being a longer hull the additional space was used to add a pair of boilers, which increased horsepower by 2,000 indicated horsepower 1,500 kW and speed by .5 knots 0.93 km h 0.58 mph . The launch of the British battlecruiser HMS Invincible in 1907 quickly rendered all of the armored cruisers that had been built by the world's navies obsolescent. Yorck was 127.8 m 419 ft long overall and had a beam of 20.2 m 66 ft 3 in and a draft of 7.76 m 25 ft 6 in forward. She displaced 9,533 t 9,382 long tons 10,508 short tons as built and 10,266 t 10,104 long tons 11,316 short tons fully loaded. The ship had a crew of 35 officers and 598 enlisted men, though this was frequently augmented with an admiral's staff during periods where the ship served as a flagship. She was propelled by three vertical triple expansion steam engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal fired water tube boilers. The ship's propulsion system developed a total of 17,272 metric horsepower 12,704 kW and yielded a maximum speed of 20.4 knots 37.8 km h 23.5 mph on trials, falling short of her intended speed of 22 knots 41 km h 25 mph . She carried up to 1,570 t 1,550 long tons 1,730 short tons of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to 5,080 nautical miles 9,410 km 5,850 mi at a cruising speed of 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph . She was armed with four 21 cm 8.3 in SK L 40 guns arranged in two twin gun turrets, one on either end of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of ten 15 cm 5.9 in SK L 40 guns four were in single gun turrets on the upper deck and the remaining six were in casemates in a main deck battery. For close range defense against torpedo boats, she carried fourteen 8.8 cm 3.5 in SK L 35 guns, all in individual mounts in the superstructure and in the hull. She also had four 45 cm 17.7 in underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. The ship was protected with Krupp cemented armor, with the belt armor being 100 mm 3.9 in thick amidships and reduced to 80 mm 3.1 in on either end. The main battery turrets had 150 mm 5.9 in thick faces. Her deck was 4060 mm 1.62.4 in thick, connected to the lower edge of the belt by 4050 mm 1.62.0 in thick sloped armor. Yorck was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Deutschland and built at the Blohm Voss shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 167. Her keel was laid down on 25 April 1903 and she was launched on 14 May 1904. General Wilhelm von Hahnke gave a speech at the launching ceremony and the vessel was christened Yorck after Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, a Prussian general during the Seven Years' War by Josephine Yorck von Wartenburg, one of his descendants. Fitting out work was completed by late 1905, when the ship began builder's trials, after which a shipyard crew transferred the vessel to Kiel, where she was commissioned into the fleet on 21 November. After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in I Scouting Group, which she formally joined on 27 March 1906. On 2 April, she replaced the armored cruiser Friedrich Carl as the group flagship, under the command of Vizeadmiral VAdmVice Admiral Gustav Schmidt. Over the next several years, Yorck took part in the peacetime routine of training exercises with the fleet reconnaissance forces and with the entire High Seas Fleet, including major fleet exercises every autumn in late August and early September. On 29 September, Konteradmiral KAdmRear Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced Schmidt as the group commander. After 1907's autumn maneuvers, Yorck went into drydock for an extensive overhaul from 11 September to 28 October, during which time Friedrich Carl temporarily replaced her as the flagship. While she was out of service, Pohl was replaced by KAdm August von Heeringen, who raised his flag aboard Yorck upon her return from the shipyard. The ship went on a major cruise into the Atlantic Ocean from 7 to 28 February 1908 with the other ships of the scouting group. During the cruise, the ships conducted various tactical exercises and experimented with using their wireless telegraphy equipment at long distances. They stopped in Vigo, Spain, to replenish their coal for the voyage home. On 1 May, the new armored cruiser Scharnhorst joined I Scouting Group, replacing Yorck as the group flagship. Another Atlantic cruise followed in July and August this time, the cruise was made in company with the battleship squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. Yorck stopped in Funchal in Madeira and A Coruna, Spain during the cruise. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Yorck won the Kaiser's Schiepreis Shooting Prize for excellent shooting among armored cruisers for the 19071908 training year. During this period, Erich Raeder served as the ship's navigation officer. In October, Kapitan zur See KzSCaptain at Sea Arthur Tapken took command of the ship he served as the ship's commander until September 1909. In February 1909, I Scouting Group went on another training cruise in the Atlantic Yorck again stopped in Vigo from 17 to 23 February. After the ships' return to Germany, Scharnhorst was detached to the East Asia Squadron on 11 March, vacating the flagship role, which Yorck again filled. Heeringen and the command staff returned to the ship the same day. The cruisers joined the High Seas Fleet for another Atlantic cruise in July and August, and Yorck visited Vilagarcia de Arousa from 18 to 26 July. On the way back to Germany, the fleet stopped in Spithead, Britain, where it was received by the Royal Navy. By early 1910, the new armored cruiser Blucher was ready for service with the fleet, and so now VAdm Heeringen hauled down his flag from Yorck on 25 April and transferred to the new vessel two days later. Yorck thereafter became the flagship of KAdm Reinhard Koch, the deputy commander of the group. Already on 16 May, Koch was replaced by KAdm Gustav Bachmann, who was in turn replaced by KAdm Maximilian von Spee on 15 September when Bachmann succeeded Heeringen as the group commander. Yorck won the Schiepreis for the 19091910 year. KzS Ludwig von Reuter served as the ship's commander from September 1910. While in the shipyard for maintenance on 31 March 1911, a benzene explosion in the ship's aft most boiler room killed one man and injured several, preventing Yorck from taking part in unit maneuvers. On 1 October, KzS and Kommodore Commodore Franz von Hipper replaced Spee, after which the ship joined a cruise to Norway and Sweden in November. She visited Uddevalla, Sweden from 3 to 6 November during the cruise. Yorck did not take part in the unit maneuvers conducted in February 1912. In March, Yorck and four light cruisers filled I Scouting Group's role during fleet exercises, and during the maneuvers now VAdm Bachmann came aboard Yorck to direct their participation. During the exercises, Hipper temporarily transferred his flag to the new battlecruiser Von der Tann, but returned thereafter until 28 August. In September, Fregattenkapitan Frigate Captain Max Kothner replaced Reuter as the ship's captain, though he served in the role only briefly before departing in November. The ship suffered an accident on 2 November when one of her pinnaces accidentally detonated a naval mine, killing two men and injuring two more. Yorck was involved in another serious accident on 4 March 1913 during training exercises off Helgoland. The torpedo boat S178 attempted to pass in front of the ship but failed to clear her in time Yorck's bow tore a hole into S178 that flooded her engine and boiler rooms. S178 sank within a few minutes of the accident and 69 men were killed in the accident. Yorck, the battleship Oldenburg, and the torpedo boat S177 were only able to pull fifteen men from the sea. Yorck was only slightly damaged in the accident and continued with the maneuvers. KAdm Felix Funke and Bachmann alternated periods aboard Yorck, with Funke flying his flag from 7 to 14 March, followed by Bachmann from 14 March to 1 May, and finally Funke from 1 to 17 May. Yorck thereafter steamed to Kiel, where on 21 May she was decommissioned, the last armored cruiser to serve with I Scouting Group. She thereafter underwent an overhaul and was placed in reserve. Most of her crew transferred to the newly completed battlecruiser Seydlitz. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Yorck was mobilized for wartime service she was recommissioned on 12 August. Initially assigned to IV Scouting Group, on 25 August she was transferred to III Scouting Group, under the command of KAdm Hubert von Rebeur Paschwitz. Beginning on 20 September, she was tasked with guarding the German Bight. The ships of III Scouting Group transferred temporarily to the Baltic Sea two days later for a sortie into the central Baltic, as far north as Ostergarn, from 22 to 29 September. They then returned to the North Sea and rejoined the High Seas Fleet. On 3 November, Yorck participated in the first offensive operation of the war conducted by the German fleet. I Scouting Group, by now commanded by RAdm Hipper, was to bombard Yarmouth on the British coast while the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sailed behind, providing distant support in the event that the raid provoked a British counterattack. Yorck and the rest of III Scouting Group provided the reconnaissance screen for the main fleet. Hipper's ships inflicted little damage and minelayers laid minefields off the coast, which later sank the British submarine D5. Upon returning to Wilhelmshaven late that day, the German ships encountered heavy fog that prevented them from safely navigating the defensive minefields that had been laid outside the port. Instead, they anchored in the Schillig roadstead. Yorck's commander, KzS Pieper, believed the fog to have cleared sufficiently to allow the vessel to return to port, so he ordered the ship to get underway. The pilot refused to take responsibility for maneuvering the ship owing to the great danger of trying to pass through the minefields under the foggy conditions. At 04 10, Yorck struck a mine and began to turn to exit the minefield, striking a second mine shortly thereafter. She quickly sank with heavy loss of life, though sources disagree on the number of fatalities. The naval historian V. E. Tarrant states that 127 out of a crew of 629 were rescued, while Erich Groner indicates that there were only 336 deaths. The naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Rohr, and Hans Otto Steinmetz concur with Groner on the number of fatalities and note that 381 men, including Pieper, were rescued by the coastal defense ship Hagen. For his reckless handling of the ship, Pieper was tried in a court martial, convicted, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment for negligence, disobedience of orders, and homicide through negligence. The wreck, located between Horumersiel and Hooksiel, was initially marked to allow vessels to pass safely. Beginning in 1926, the wreck was partially scrapped to reduce the navigational hazard to deeper draft vessels. More work was done in 19361937 for the same reason. During a series of construction programs to expand the entrance to the Jade after World War II, the ship's turrets were removed in 1969 and the remaining parts of the hull were demolished in 1983 to further clear the sea floor.

"York is a city and unitary authority area in North Yorkshire, England, the population of the council area which includes nearby villages was 208,200 as of 2017 and the population of the Urban area was 153,717 at the 2011 census. Located at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss, it is the county town of the historic county of Yorkshire. The city is known for its famous historical landmarks such as York Minster and the city walls, as well as a variety of cultural and sporting activities, which makes it a popular tourist destination in England. The local authority is the City of York Council, a single tier governing body responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout the city. The City of York local government district includes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries. It is about 20 miles north east of Leeds. The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD. It became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria and Jorvik. In the Middle Ages, York grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, York became a major hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre, a status it maintained well into the 20th century. During the Second World War, York was bombed as part of the Baedeker Blitz. Although less affected by bombing than other northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration efforts continued into the 1960s. In 2000, York suffered very severe flooding as the River Ouse rose, affecting over 300 homes. The economy of York is dominated by services. The University of York and National Health Service are major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy. In 2016, York became sister cities with the Chinese city of Nanjing, as per an agreement signed by the Lord Mayor of York, focusing on building links in tourism, education, science, technology and culture. Today, the city is a popular tourist attraction, especially for international visitors from China and Asia. In 2017, York became UK's first human rights city, which formalised the citys aim to use human rights in decision making. The word York Old Norse Jorvik is derived from the Brittonic name Eburakon Latinised variously as Eboracum, Eburacum or Eburaci , a combination of eburos yew tree compare Old Irish ibar yew tree Irish iobhar, iubhar, iur Scottish Gaelic iubhar , Welsh efwr alder buckthorn , Breton evor alder buckthorn and a suffix of appurtenance ako n belonging to , place of compare Welsh og meaning either place of the yew trees efrog in Welsh, Old Irish iubrach grove of yew trees, place with one or more yew trees , iurach in Irish Gaelic and iubhrach in Scottish Gaelic the city itself is called Eabhrach Irish and Eabhraig in those languages, from the Latin Eboracum or alternatively, the settlement of a man named Eburos a Celtic personal name is mentioned in different documents as E, Eburus and Eburius and, when combined with the Celtic possessive suffix ako n , could be used to denote his property . The name Eboracum became the Anglian Eoforwic in the 7th century a compound of Eofor , from the old name, and wic a village, probably by conflation of the element Ebor with a Germanic root eburaz 'boar' by the 7th century the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jorvik. The Old French and Norman name of the city following the Norman Conquest was recorded as Everwic modern Norman Everoui in works such as Wace's Roman de Rou. Jorvik, meanwhile, gradually reduced to York in the centuries after the Conquest, moving from the Middle English Yerk in the 14th century through Yourke in the 16th century to Yarke in the 17th century. The form York was first recorded in the 13th century. Many company and place names, such as the Ebor race meeting, refer to the Latinised Brittonic, Roman name. The 12thcentury chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of Britain, Historia Regum Britanniae, suggests the name derives from that of a pre Roman city founded by the legendary king Ebraucus. The Archbishop of York uses Ebor as his surname in his signature. Archaeological evidence suggests that Mesolithic people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000 BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory. The city was founded in 71 AD, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the River Ouse close to its confluence with the River Foss. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of 50 acres 20 ha and was inhabited by 6,000 legionary soldiers. The site of the principia HQ of the fortress lies under the foundations of York Minster, and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns. The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207211 AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a 'colonia' or city. Constantius I died in 306 AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 314 AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province. While the Roman colonia and fortress were on high ground, by 400 AD the town was victim to occasional flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced. York declined in the post Roman era, and was taken and settled by the Angles in the 5th century. Reclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under King Edwin of Northumbria, and York became his chief city. The first wooden minster church was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede. Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor Oswald. In the following century, Alcuin of York came to the cathedral school of York. He had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York now known as St Peter's School, founded in 627 AD, and later as Charlemagne's leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs. In 866, Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and captured York. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe. The last ruler of an independent Jorvik, Eric Bloodaxe, was driven from the city in 954 AD by King Eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England. In 1068, two years after the Norman conquest of England, the people of York rebelled. Initially they were successful, but upon the arrival of William the Conqueror the rebellion was put down. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the Harrying of the North where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse. See Peter Rex's The English Resistance, The Underground War Against the Normans, 2006. The first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site. Around the year 1080, Archbishop Thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster. In the 12th century York started to prosper. In 1190, York Castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its Jewish inhabitants, in which at least 150 Jews died although some authorities put the figure as high as 500 . The city, through its location on the River Ouse and its proximity to the Great North Road, became a major trading centre. King John granted the city's first charter in 1212, confirming trading rights in England and Europe. During the later Middle Ages, York merchants imported wine from France, cloth, wax, canvas, and oats from the Low Countries, timber and furs from the Baltic and exported grain to Gascony and grain and wool to the Low Countries. York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. Edward I further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so called Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of Richard II in 1396. The city underwent a period of economic decline during Tudor times. Under King Henry VIII, the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the end of York's many monastic houses, including several orders of friars, the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the Pilgrimage of Grace, an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the Council of the North in York in the dissolved St Mary's Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period. Guy Fawkes, who was born and educated in York, was a member of a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its aim was to displace Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside. In 1644, during the Civil War, the Parliamentarians besieged York, and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The barbican at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but the plot was discovered. On the arrival of Prince Rupert, with an army of 15,000 men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some 6 miles 10 km from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the Battle of Marston Moor. Of Rupert's 15,000 troops, 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed and the city surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax on 15 July. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre eminent position as a trading centre, but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising. York's many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse. During this period, the American city of New York and the colony that contained it were renamed after the Duke of York later King James II . mak all t'railways cum to York The railway promoter George Hudson was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839. Although Hudson's career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy, his promotion of York over Leeds, and of his own railway company the York and North Midland Railway , helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late 19th century. The introduction of the railways established engineering in the city. At the turn of the 20th century, the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway, which employed more than 5,500 people. The railway was instrumental in the expansion of Rowntree's Cocoa Works. It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree, who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist Joseph. Another chocolate manufacturer, Terry's of York, was a major employer. By 1900, the railways and confectionery had become the city's two major industries. In 1942, the city was bombed during the Second World War part of the Baedeker Blitz by the German Luftwaffe and 92 people were killed and hundreds injured. Buildings damaged in the raid included the Railway Station, Rowntree's Factory, Poppleton Road Primary School, St Martin le Grand Church, the Bar Convent and the Guildhall which was left in total disrepair until 1960. With the emergence of tourism, the historic core of York became one of the city's major assets, and in 1968 it was designated a conservation area. The existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the National Railway Museum in York in 1975, the Jorvik Viking Centre in 1984 and the York Dungeon in 1986. The opening of the University of York in 1963 added to the prosperity of the city. In March 2012, York's Chocolate Story opened. York was voted European Tourism City of the Year by European Cities Marketing in June 2007, beating 130 other European cities to gain first place, surpassing Gothenburg in Sweden second and Valencia in Spain third . York was also voted safest place to visit in the 2010 Conde Nast Traveller Readers Choice Awards. In 2018, The Sunday Times deemed York to be its overall 'Best Place to Live' in Britain, highlighting the city's perfect mix of heritage and hi tech and as a mini metropolis with cool cafes, destination restaurants, innovative companies plus the fastest internet in Britain . The result was confirmed in a YouGov survey, reported in August 2018, with 92 of respondents saying that they liked the city, more than any of 56 other British cities. York was a centre of early photography, as described by Hugh Murray in his 1986 book Photographs and Photographers of York The Early Years, 184479. Photographers who had studios in York included William Hayes, William Pumphrey, and Augustus Mahalski who operated on Davygate and Low Petergate in the 19th century, having come to England as a refugee after serving as a Polish lancer in the Austro Hungarian war. For a detailed history of local government in the City of York, see City of York Council. The City of York is governed by the City of York Council. It is a unitary authority that operates on a leader and cabinet style of governance, having the powers of a non metropolitan county and district council combined. It provides a full range of local government services including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority. The city council consists of 47 councillors representing 21 wards, with two or three per ward serving four year terms. Its headquarters are at the Guildhall and West Offices in the city centre. York is divided into 21 administrative wards Acomb, Bishopthorpe, Clifton, Copmanthorpe, Dringhouses and Woodthorpe, Fishergate, Fulford and Heslington, Guildhall, Haxby and Wigginton, Heworth, Heworth Without, Holgate, Hull Road, Huntington and New Earswick, Micklegate, Osbaldwick and Derwent, Rawcliffe and Clifton Without, Rural West York, Strensall, Westfield, and Wheldrake. The members of the cabinet, led by the Council Leader, makes decisions on their portfolio areas individually. Following the Local Government Act 2000, the Council Leader commands the confidence of the city council the leader of the largest political group and head of the City of York Council. The Leader of the Council and the cabinet consisting of all the executive councillors are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the city council. The current Council Leader, Liberal Democrats' Cllr Keith Aspden, was appointed on 22 May 2019, following the 2019 City of York Council election. York's first citizen and civic head is the Lord Mayor, who is the chairman of the City of York Council. The appointment is made by the city council each year in May, at the same time appointing the Sheriff, the city's other civic head. The offices of Lord Mayor and Sheriff are purely ceremonial. The Lord Mayor carries out civic and ceremonial duties in addition to chairing full council meetings. The incumbent Lord Mayor since 22 May 2019 is Councillor Janet Looker, and the Sheriff is Jo Trythall. York Youth Council consists of several young people who negotiate with the councillors to get better facilities for York's young people, and who also elect York's Member of Youth Parliament. As a result of the 2019 City of York Council election the Conservative Party was reduced to two seats. The Liberal Democrats had 21 councillors. The Labour Party had 17 councillors and the Green Party had four with three Independents. Due to no overall control, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party agreed to form a coalition on 14 May 2019. York is the traditional county town of Yorkshire, and therefore did not form part of any of its three historic ridings, or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370. York is an ancient borough, and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough. It gained the status of a county borough in 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, and existed so until 1974, when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became a non metropolitan district in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor, its Sheriff and Aldermen. As a result of 1990s UK local government reform, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts, and about half the population of the Ryedale district. The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council's own proposal. From 1997 to 2010, the central part of the district was covered by the City of York constituency, while the remainder was split between the constituencies of Ryedale, Selby, and Vale of York. These constituencies were represented by Hugh Bayley, John Greenway, John Grogan, and Anne McIntosh respectively. Following their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in North Yorkshire, the Boundary Commission for England recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York, in time for the general election in 2010. These are York Central, which covers the inner urban area, and is entirely surrounded by the York Outer constituency. The whole of the city and local council area lies within the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency of the European Parliament. York is within the ceremonial territorial jurisdiction of the Dukedom of York which is presently held by Prince Andrew, the incumbent Duke of York. The city is 22 miles 35 km north east of Leeds, and is part of the Leeds Region. York lies in the Vale of York, a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last Ice Age. During Roman times, the land surrounding the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive and until 2015 mostly effective network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years more than 300 homes were flooded. In December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood prone for development other than agriculture. The ings are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city. York Minster, a large Gothic cathedral, dominates the city. York Castle, a complex of buildings ranging from the medieval Clifford's Tower to the 20th century entrance to the York Castle Museum formerly a prison has had a chequered history. York's centre is enclosed by the city's medieval walls, which are a popular walk. These defences are the most complete in England. They have the only walls set on high ramparts and they retain all their principal gateways. They incorporate part of the walls of the Roman fortress and some Norman and medieval work, as well as 19th and 20th century renovations. The entire circuit is approximately 2.5 miles 4 km , and encloses an area of 263 acres 106 ha . The north east section includes a part where walls never existed, because the Norman moat of York Castle, formed by damming the River Foss, also created a lake which acted as a city defence. This lake was later called the King's Fishpond, as the rights to fish belonged to the Crown. A feature of central York is the Snickelways, narrow pedestrian routes, many of which led towards the former market places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, although it is not located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, at the edge of the churchyard of Holy Trinity church. As well as the Castle Museum, the city contains numerous other museums and historic buildings such as the Yorkshire Museum and its Museum Gardens, Jorvik Viking Centre, York Art Gallery, the Richard III Experience, Merchant Adventurers' Hall, the reconstructed medieval house Barley Hall owned by the York Archaeological Trust , the 18th century Fairfax House, the Mansion House the historic home of the Lord Mayor and the so called Treasurer's House owned by the National Trust . The National Railway Museum is situated just beyond the station, and is home to a vast range of transport material and the largest collection of railway locomotives in the world. Included in this collection are the world's fastest steam locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard and the world famous LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman, which has been overhauled in the Museum. Although noted for its Medieval history, visitors can also gain an understanding of the Cold War through visiting the York Cold War Bunker, former headquarters of No 20 Group of the Royal Observer Corps. York is noted for its numerous churches and pubs. Most of the remaining churches in York are from the medieval period. St William's College behind the Minster, and Bedern Hall, off Goodramgate, are former dwelling places of the canons of the York Minster. York has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the Vale of York the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the Yorkshire and Humberside region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring and very early summer. Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. As with much of the British Isles, the weather is changeable. York experiences most sunshine from May to July, an average of six hours per day. With its inland location, summers are often warmer than the Yorkshire coast with temperatures of 27 C or more. Extremes recorded at the University of York campus between 1998 and 2010 include a highest temperature of 34.5 C 94.1 F and a lowest temperature of 16.3 C 2.7 F Monday 6 December 2010 . The most rainfall in one day was 88.4 millimetres 3.5 in . York is bounded by a green belt area, which more rigorously manages development around the rural area of the district and portions of surrounding districts, primarily to preserve the setting and historic character of York. The belt covers nearly all of the city district including all its outer villages, and extends into the surrounding North Yorkshire districts of Hambleton, Harrogate, Ryedale, and Selby. The York urban area built up area had a population of 153,717 at the time of the 2011 UK census, compared with 137,505 in 2001. The population of the City of York Local Authority was 198,051 and its ethnic composition was 94.3 White, 1.2 Mixed, 3.4 Asian and 0.6 Black. York's elderly population those 65 and over was 16.9 , however only 13.2 were listed as retired. Also at the time of the 2001 UK census, the City of York had a total population of 181,094 of whom 93,957 were female and 87,137 were male. Of the 76,920 households in York, 36.0 were married couples living together, 31.3 were one person households, 8.7 were co habiting couples and 8.0 were lone parents. The figures for lone parent households were below the national average of 9.5 , and the percentage of married couples was also close to the national average of 36.5 the proportion of one person households was slightly higher than the national average of 30.1 . In 2001, the population density was 4,368 km2 11,310 sq mi . Of those aged 1674 in York, 24.6 had no academic qualifications, a little lower than 28.9 in all of England. Of York's residents, 5.1 were born outside the United Kingdom, significantly lower than the national average of 9.2 . White British form 95 of the population the largest single minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.9 of the population. The number of theft from a vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 8.8 and 2.7, compared to the English national average of 6.9 and 2.7 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 0.9, in line with the national average. The national average of violence against another person was 16.2 compared to the York average of 17.5. The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 200607 financial year. The table below details the population change since 1801. Christianity is the religion with the largest following in York, with 59.5 residents reporting themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. The percentages following each non Christian religion were all below the national average for England, but those responding as No Religion were higher than the national average.

York's economy is based on the service industry, which in 2000 was responsible for 88.7 of employment in the city. The service industries include public sector employment, health, education, finance, information technology IT and tourism that accounts for 10.7 of employment. Tourism has become an important element of the economy, with the city offering a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural activities. As a holiday destination York was the 6th most visited English city by UK residents 201416 and the 13th most visited by overseas visitors 2016 . A 2014 report, based on 2012 data, stated that the city receives 6.9 million visitors annually they contribute 564 million to the economy and support over 19,000 jobs. In the 2017 Conde Nast Traveller survey of readers, York rated 12th among The 15 Best Cities in the UK for visitors. Unemployment in York was low at 4.2 in 2008 compared to the United Kingdom national average of 5.3 . The biggest employer in York is the City of York Council, with over 7,500 employees. Employers with more than 2,000 staff include Aviva formerly Norwich Union Life , Network Rail, Northern, York Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of York. Other major employers include British Telecom, CPP Group, Nestle, NFU Mutual and a number of railway companies. Today's economic position is very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30 of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75 of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage works known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB at the time of closure , which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people, but closed in the mid 1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestle York formerly Nestle Rowntrees and home to the KitKat and eponymous Yorkie bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the Chocolate Orange, was located in the city but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse. On 20 September 2006, Nestle announced that it would cut 645 jobs at the Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came after a number of other job losses in the city at Aviva, British Sugar and Terry's chocolate factory. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began to be felt. Since the closure of the carriage works, the site has been developed into offices. York's economy has been developing in the areas of science, technology and the creative industries. The city became a founding National Science City with the creation of a science park near the University of York. Between 1998 and 2008 York gained 80 new technology companies and 2,800 new jobs in the sector. Regional gross value added figures for York, at 2005 basic prices in millions of pounds sterling, are Under the requirements of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, York City Council appointed a watch committee which established a police force and appointed a chief constable. On 1 June 1968 the York City, East Riding of Yorkshire and North Riding of Yorkshire police forces were amalgamated to form the York and North East Yorkshire Police. Since 1974, Home Office policing in York has been provided by the North Yorkshire Police. The force's central headquarters for policing York and nearby Selby are in Fulford. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, whose headquarters is at Northallerton. The city's first hospital, York County Hospital, opened in 1740 in Monkgate funded by public subscription. It closed in 1976 when it was replaced by York Hospital, which opened the same year and gained Foundation status in April 2007. It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient, daycase and outpatient services. It is also known as York District Hospital and YDH. The Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust was formed on 1 July 2006 bringing together South Yorkshire Ambulance Service, West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the North and East Yorkshire parts of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service to provide patient transport. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by clinics and surgeries. The city's first subscription library opened in 1794. The first free public library, the York Library, was built on Clifford Street in 1893, to mark Queen Victoria's jubilee. A new building was erected on Museum Street in 1927, and this is still the library today it was extended in 1934 and 1938. Since 1998 waste management has been co ordinated via the York and North Yorkshire Waste Partnership. York's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is CE Electric UK there are no power stations in the city. Yorkshire Water, which has a local water extraction plant on the River Derwent at Elvington, manages York's drinking and waste water. The city has a magistrates' court, and venues for the Crown Court and the County Court. The Crown Court House was designed by the architect John Carr, next to the then prison including execution area . Between 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr's elegant Court House for the Assizes of the whole county. The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the Eye of the Ridings , or the Eye of York . 1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. Horse theft was a capital offence. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a common informer whose task was to bring criminals to justice. The former prison is now the Castle Museum but still contains the cells. York's location on the River Ouse and in the centre of the Vale of York means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal. Until the end of the 20th century, the Ouse was used by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull. The last significant such traffic was the supply of newsprint to the local newspaper's Foss side print works, which continued until 1997. Today navigation is almost exclusively leisure oriented. Like most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the A19 road from Doncaster to Tyneside, the A59 road from Liverpool to York, the A64 road from Leeds to Scarborough, and the A1079 road from York to Hull. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the A1 M and the M1 motorways at a distance of about 10 miles 15 km from the city. The transpennine M62 motorway is less than 20 miles 30 km away providing links to Manchester and Liverpool. The city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some 3 miles 5 km from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as car free during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, six bus based park and ride sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road, and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus. York has been a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839 at the beginning of the railway age. For many years the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway. York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh. It takes less than two hours to get to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long distance trains on CrossCountry services linking Edinburgh and Newcastle with destinations in south and west England via Birmingham. TransPennine Express provide a frequent service of semi fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Leeds, Manchester, Manchester Airport, and Liverpool. Local stopping services by Northern connect York to Selby, Harrogate, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and many intermediate points, as well as many other stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. York has an airfield at the former RAF Elvington, some 7 miles 11 km south east of the city centre, which is the home of the Yorkshire Air Museum. Elvington is used for private aviation. In 2003 plans were drafted to expand the site for business aviation or a full commercial service. York is linked to Manchester Airport by an hourly direct TransPennine Express train, giving access to the principal airport serving the north of England, with connections to many destinations in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. Leeds Bradford Airport is closer to York but the hourly York Air Coach service operated by First York was withdrawn as of April 2009. Leeds Bradford Airport provides connections to most major European and North African airports as well as Pakistan and New York City. Public transport within the city is largely bus based. First York operates the majority of the city's local bus services, as well as the York park and ride services. York was the location of the first implementation of FirstGroup's experimental and controversial FTR bus concept, which sought to confer the advantages of a modern tramway system at a lower cost. The service was withdrawn following an election manifesto pledge by the Labour Group at the 2011 local government election. Transdev York also operates a large number of local bus services. Open top tourist and sightseeing buses are operated by Transdev York on behalf of City Sightseeing. Rural services, linking local towns and villages with York, are provided by a number of companies with Transdev York, EYMS, and Reliance operating most of them. Longer distance bus services are provided by a number of operators, including Arriva Yorkshire services to Selby, East Yorkshire Motor Services routes to Hull, Beverley, Driffield, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and Harrogate Bus Company services to Knaresborough and Harrogate. Yorkshire Coastliner links Leeds via York with Scarborough, Filey, Bridlington and Whitby. English local authorities are required to produce Local Transport Plans LTPs , strategies for developing local integrated transport as part of a longer term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 20062011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for the first five years of the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the bus network including park and ride services, provision of off road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures. The University of York's main campus is on the southern edge of the city at Heslington. The Department of Archaeology and the graduate Centres for Eighteenth Century Studies and Medieval Studies are located in the historic King's Manor in the city centre. It was York's only institution with university status until 2006, when the more centrally located York St John University, formerly an autonomous college of the University of Leeds, attained full university status. The city formerly hosted a branch of the University of Law before it moved to Leeds. The University of York also has a medical school, Hull York Medical School. The city has two major further education institutions. York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College. Students there study a very wide range of academic and vocational courses, and range from school leavers and sixth formers to people training to make career moves. Askham Bryan College offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as horticulture, agriculture, animal management and even golf course management. There are 70 local council schools with over 24,000 pupils in the City of York Council area. The City of York Council manages most primary and secondary schools within the city. Primary schools cover education from ages 511, with some offering early years education from age 3. From 1116 education is provided by 10 secondary schools, four of which offer additional education up to the age of 18. In 2007 Oaklands Sports College and Lowfield Comprehensive School merged to become one school known as York High School. York also has several private schools. St Peter's School was founded in 627. The scholar Alcuin, who went on to serve Charlemagne, taught there. It was also the school attended by Guy Fawkes. Two schools have Quaker origins Bootham School is co educational and The Mount School is all girls. On the outskirts of the city is Queen Margaret's School. Pupils from The Minster School, York sing in York Minster choir. The Theatre Royal, which was established in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences from around the country to see its veteran star, Berwick Kaler. The Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to the Riding Lights Theatre Company, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances. The York Mystery Plays are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the Building of Noah's Ark and the fish sellers and mariners the Landing of Noah's Ark . The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the Festival of Britain, when York was one of the cities with a regional festival. They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open air theatre within the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead actors have included Christopher Timothy and Robson Green in the role of Christ and Dame Judi Dench as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. She remains a Patron of the plays . The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the Dean's Park, or at the Eye of York. They go around the streets, recreating the original productions. In 2012, the York Mystery Plays were performed between 2 and 27 August at St. Mary's Abbey in the York Museum Gardens. The Academy of St Olave's, a chamber orchestra which gives concerts in St Olave's Church, Marygate, is one of the music groups that perform regularly in York. A former church, St Margaret's, Walmgate, is the National Centre for Early Music, which hosts concerts, broadcasts, competitions and events including the York Early Music Festival. Students, staff and visiting artists of York St John University music department regularly perform lunchtime concerts in the University chapel. The staff and students of the University of York also perform in the city. One of the notable local products is York ham, a mild flavoured ham with delicate pink colouring. It is traditionally served with Madeira Sauce. As a lightly smoked, dry cured ham, York ham is saltier but milder in flavour than other European dry cured hams. Folklore has it that the oak construction for York Minster provided the sawdust for smoking the ham. Robert Burrow Atkinson's butchery shop, in Blossom Street, is the birthplace of the original York Ham and the reason why the premises became famous. Each September since 1997, York has held an annual Festival of Food and Drink. The aim of the festival is to spotlight food culture in York and North Yorkshire by promoting local food production. The Festival attracts up to 150,000 visitors over 10 days, from all over the country. In the centre of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Cafe Tea Rooms. Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant cafe in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them. The Assize of Ale is an annual event in the city where people in medieval costume take part in a pub crawl to raise money for local charities. It has its origins in the 13th century, when an Assize of Bread and Ale was used to regulate the quality of goods. The current version was resurrected in the 1990s by the Sheriff of York and is led by the Guild of Scriveners. In June 2015 York CAMRA listed 101 pubs on its map of the city centre, some of which are hundreds of years old. These include the Golden Fleece, Ye Olde Starre Inne, noted for its sign which has spanned the street since 1733, and The Kings Arms, often photographed during floods. On 18 June 2016, York CAMRA undertook a Beer Census and found 328 unique real ales being served in over 200 pubs in York, reinforcing the city's reputation as a top UK beer destination. The Knavesmire, home of York Racecourse, plays host to Yorkshire's largest beer festival every September run by York CAMRA York Beer Cider Festival. It is housed in a marquee opposite the grandstand of the racecourse in the enclosure and in 2016 offered over 450 real ales and over 100 ciders. In 2010 York's city council and a number of heritage organisations submitted a bid for York's entire city centre to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This nomination, to the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport would have included York on a list of tentative sites to be reviewed by UNESCO itself. York's bid failed, leading to 'disappointment' from the team involved. This indirectly led to the city making a successful bid to be part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of Media Arts. It is the fourth of these cities, following Lyon, France Enghien les Bains, France and Sapporo, Japan. The York area is served by a local newspaper, The Press known as the Evening Press until April 2006 , The York Advertiser newspaper based at The Press on Walmgate , and three local radio stations Minster FM, Vale Radio and BBC Radio York.

"HMS York was the first of two York class heavy cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the late 1920s. She mostly served on the North America and West Indies Station before World War II. Early in the war the ship escorted convoys in the Atlantic and participated in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940. York was transferred to the Mediterranean theatre in late 1940 where she escorted convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was wrecked in an attack by Italian explosive motorboats of the 10th Flotilla MAS at Suda Bay, Crete, in March 1941. The ship's wreck was salvaged in 1952 and scrapped in Bari. York's design was based on the earlier County classes but was intended to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, Exeter, as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were angled to the rear. In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring 'B' gun turret forward. York displaced 8,250 long tons 8,380 t at standard load and 10,620 long tons 10,790 t at deep load. The ship had an overall length of 575 feet 175.3 m , a beam of 57 feet 17.4 m and a draught of 20 feet 3 inches 6.2 m . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four shafts, which developed a total of 80,000 shaft horsepower 60,000 kW and gave a maximum speed of 32.25 knots 59.73 km h 37.11 mph . Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3 drum water tube boilers. York carried a maximum of 1,900 long tons 1,900 t of fuel oil that gave her a range of 13,300 nautical miles 24,600 km 15,300 mi at 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph . The ship's complement was 628 officers and men. The ship mounted six 50 calibre 8 inch 203 mm guns in three twin turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of four QF 4 inch 102 mm Mk V anti aircraft AA guns in single mounts. York mounted two single 2 pounder 40 mm light AA guns pom poms . The ship carried two triple torpedo tube above water mounts for 21 inch 533 mm torpedoes. York lacked a full waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms were protected by 3 inches 76 mm of armour and sides of the magazines were protected by 4.375 inches 111.1 mm of armour. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were 3.5 inches 89 mm thick. The top and ends of the magazines were three inches thick. The lower deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches 38 mm . Space and weight was reserved for one catapult and its seaplane, but they were not fitted until after she was completed. A second catapult, intended to be mounted on 'B' turret, was deleted from the design during construction. York was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow, on 18 May 1927, launched on 17 July 1928 and was completed on 1 May 1930. She became the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon commissioning. Between 1931 and 1934 she was commanded by Captain Richard Bevan. She served with the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station, and was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 and 1936 for the Second Italo Abyssinian War, before returning to the American Station until the outbreak of war in September 1939. The ship was transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia that same month for convoy escort duties. In October 1939, York was assigned to Force F at Halifax, which was active in hunting for commerce raiders and protecting convoys. She was briefly refitted in Bermuda between 31 October and 22 November before she returned to Great Britain for a more thorough refit in December. Upon its completion on 9 February York was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet. On 3 March 1940 the ship intercepted the German blockade runner Arucas in the Denmark Strait near Iceland, but she was scuttled by her own crew before she could be captured. In early April 1940, York, and the rest of her squadron, were assigned to carry troops under Plan R 4, the British plan to invade Norway. The troops were disembarked on 8 April when the British learned of the imminent German invasion of Norway and the squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral John Cunningham, joined the bulk of the Home Fleet already at sea. On 10 April the destroyer HMS Eclipse was badly damaged by air attack and York was detailed to tow her to Lerwick for repairs. The ship, and the light cruisers HMS Manchester and HMS Birmingham, ferried the 1st Battalion of the Green Howards and other troops from Rosyth to Andalsnes and Molde on 2425 April. York returned home on 26 April. York was one of the ships used to evacuate British and French troops from Namsos, along with three French transports and a number of British destroyers, on the evening of 1 2 May. In August 1940 York was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, joining the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in Alexandria in late September, after escorting a convoy around the Cape of Good Hope. Two days later she participated in Operation MB.5, where the Mediterranean Fleet escorted the light cruisers HMS Liverpool and HMS Gloucester as they ferried troops to Malta. During the Battle of Cape Passero, York sank the disabled and abandoned destroyer Artigliere on 13 October after the destroyer's engagement with the light cruiser HMS Ajax the previous evening. A month later York and the Mediterranean Fleet executed Operation MB8, a complex series of manoeuvers, including Operation Judgement, where the ship escorted the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious as her aircraft attacked the Italian Fleet at Taranto on the evening of 11 12 November. A few days later York ferried British troops from Alexandria, Egypt, to Piraeus, Greece. On 26 November, York, and the rest of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, covered a small convoy to Malta. The Mediterranean Fleet, including York, sortied on 16 December to conduct air strikes on Italian shipping, airbases on Rhodes and to bombard Valona. In early January 1941 the ship escorted the tanker RFA Brambleleaf and four Flower class corvettes to Suda Bay, Crete, and covered operations in the Eastern Mediterranean during Operation Excess. She arrived back at Alexandria on 16 January. York returned to Suda Bay in early February for operations against Italian shipping. During Operation Lustre in March, she protected troop convoys from Egypt to Greece. York was disabled at Suda Bay in Crete by two Italian explosive motorboats of the Italian Regia Marina assault Flotilla Decima Flottiglia MAS, launched by the destroyers Crispi and Sella on 26 March 1941 the two old destroyers were fitted with special cranes to operate assault craft. Six motorboats entered the bay, led by Tenente di vascello Luigi Faggioni, and attacked three targets in pairs the first was York, second the tanker Pericles and last another ship at anchor. Three of the attacking boats had various problems, either mechanical or human, due to the extreme temperature conditions, but the other three successfully attacked their targets. Two motorboats, packed with 330 kilogram 730 lb charges in the bows, struck York amidships, flooding both boiler rooms and one engine room. Two British seamen were killed. All Italian sailors survived the attack and fell into British hands. The ship was run aground to prevent her from sinking. The submarine HMS Rover was used to supply electrical power to operate the cruiser's guns for anti aircraft defence, until Rover was severely damaged by air attack and had to be towed away for repairs. On 18 May, further damage was inflicted by German bombers and the ship was damaged beyond repair. Her main guns were wrecked by demolition charges on 22 May 1941 when the Allies began to evacuate Crete. York's wreck was salvaged in February 1952 by an Italian shipbreaker and towed to Bari to be broken up, beginning on 3 March.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20York%20%2890%29
"York Castle is a fortified complex in the city of York, England. It has comprised a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings, which were built over the last nine centuries on the south side of the River Foss. The now ruined keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford's Tower. Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of Jorvik, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929. The first motte and bailey castle on the site was built in 1068 following the Norman conquest of York. After the destruction of the castle by rebels and a Viking army in 1069, York Castle was rebuilt and reinforced with extensive water defences, including a moat and an artificial lake. York Castle formed an important royal fortification in the north of England. In 1190, 150 local Jews were killed in a pogrom in the castle keep most of them committed suicide in order not to fall into the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone in the middle of the 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations. York Castle fell into disrepair by the 15th and 16th centuries, becoming used increasingly as a jail for both local felons and political prisoners. By the time of Elizabeth I the castle was estimated to have lost all of its military value but was maintained as a centre of royal authority in York. The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw York Castle being repaired and refortified, playing a part in the Royalist defence of York in 1644 against Parliamentary forces. York Castle continued to be garrisoned until 1684, when an explosion destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower. The castle bailey was redeveloped in a neoclassical style in the 18th century as a centre for county administration in Yorkshire, and was used as a jail and debtors' prison. Prison reform in the 19th century led to the creation of a new prison built in a Tudor Gothic style on the castle site in 1825 used first as a county and then as a military prison, this facility was demolished in 1935. By the 20th century the ruin of Clifford's Tower had become a well known tourist destination and national monument today the site is owned by English Heritage and open to the public. The other remaining buildings serve as the York Castle Museum and the Crown Court. York was a Viking capital in the 10th century, and continued as an important northern city in the 11th century. In 1068, on William the Conqueror's first northern expedition after the Norman Conquest, he built a number of castles across the north east of England, including one at York. This first castle at York was a basic wooden motte and bailey castle built between the rivers Ouse and Foss on the site of the present day York Castle. It was built in haste contemporary accounts imply it was constructed in only eight days, although this assertion has been challenged. The motte was originally around 200 feet 61 metres wide at the base. As it was built in an urban environment, hundreds of houses had to be destroyed to make way for the development. William Malet, the sheriff of Yorkshire, was placed in charge of the castle and successfully defended it against an immediate uprising by the local population. In response to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill on the west bank of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes. William conducted a widespread sequence of punitive operations across the north of England in the aftermath of the attacks in 1069 and 1070. This Harrying of the North restored sufficient order to allow the rebuilding of the two castles, again in wood. The bailey at York Castle was enlarged slightly in the process buildings believed to have been inside the bailey at this time include halls, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges workshops . By the time Domesday Book was written in 1086, York Castle was also surrounded by a water filled moat and a large artificial lake called the King's Pool, fed from the river Foss by a dam built for the purpose. More property, including two watermills, had to be destroyed to make way for the water defences. Over time the Baile Hill site was abandoned in favour of the first castle site, leaving only the motte, which still exists. Henry II visited York Castle four times during his reign. The royal chambers at the time were inside the keep for safety, and Henry paid 15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid 12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired. In 1190, York Castle was the location of one of the worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans had introduced the first Jewish communities into England, where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death. Richard I was crowned king in 1189 and announced his intention to join the Crusades this inflamed anti Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, the leader of the Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet 4 metres at a cost of 207. King John used York Castle extensively during his reign, using the keep as his personal quarters for his own security. The castle was kept in good repair during that time. During this period, the first records of the use of the castle as a jail appeared, with references to prisoners taken during John's Irish campaigns being held at York Castle. By the 13th century there was a well established system of castle guards in place, under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist in protecting the castle. Henry III also made extensive use of the castle, but during his visit at Christmas 1228 a gale destroyed the wooden keep on the motte. The keep was apparently not repaired, and a building for the king's use was built in the bailey instead. In 1244, when the Scots threatened to invade England, King Henry III visited the castle and ordered it to be rebuilt in white limestone, at a cost of about 2,600. The work was carried out between 1245 and 1270, and included the construction of a towered curtain wall, a gatehouse of considerable size with two large towers, two smaller gatehouses, a small watergate, a small gateway into the city, a chapel, and a new stone keep, first known as the King's, later Clifford's, Tower. Clifford's Tower is of an unusual design. The two storey tower has a quatrefoil plan with four circular lobes. Each lobe measures 22 feet 6.5 metres across, with walls 9 feet 6 inches 3 metres thick at its widest, the tower is 79 feet 24 metres across. A square gatehouse, 21 feet 6.5 metres wide, protected the entrance on the south side between two of the lobes. There are defensive turrets between the other lobes. Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor. Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points. A chapel was built over the entrance, measuring 15 feet by 14 feet 4.5 metres by 4.2 metres , doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles. The tower is believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep. Although unique to England, the design of the tower closely resembles that at Etampes in France, and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle. Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project, and the cost of the tower accounted for the majority of the overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work. The new castle needed constant investment to maintain its quality as a military fortification. Winter floods in 131516 damaged the soil at the base of the motte, requiring immediate repairs. Around 135860, the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south eastern lobe cracked from top to bottom. Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt, but, instead, the lobe was repaired at a cost of 200. Edward I gave wide reaching powers to the sheriff of Yorkshire for enforcing law and order in the city of York, and the sheriffs established their headquarters in Clifford's Tower. During the wars against the Scots under both Edward and his son, York Castle also formed the centre of royal administration in England for almost half the years between 1298 and 1338. Many Westminster institutions followed the king north to York, basing themselves in the castle compound. The existing castle buildings were insufficient to house all the administrative institutions a temporary building inside the castle was built for the Court of Common Pleas at the beginning of the period, and rebuilt on a larger scale during 131920. The Exchequer took over Clifford's Tower. Other buildings around the city had to be commandeered to absorb the overflow from the castle itself. As a result of the extended use of the castle for these purposes, the law courts at York Castle began to compete with those in London, a pattern that lasted into the 1360s. The castle eventually acquired its own mint in 1344, when Edward III decided to create a permanent mint in York Castle to produce gold and silver coins to serve the needs of the north of England. European coiners were brought to York to establish the facility. Henry III extended the castle's role as a jail for holding a wide range of prisoners. The sheriff was responsible for the jail at this time, and his deputy usually took the role of a full time jailer. Up to three hundred and ten prisoners were held in the castle at any one time. The conditions in which prisoners were held were appalling , and led to the widespread loss of life amongst detainees. Prison escapes were relatively common, and many of them, such as the break out by 28 prisoners in 1298, were successful. When the Military Order of the Knights Templar was dissolved in England in 1307, York Castle was used to hold many of the arrested knights. The castle mills, as former Templar property, returned to royal control at the same time. Edward II also used the castle as a jail in his campaign against his rebellious barons in 1322, and after the battle of Boroughbridge many of the defeated rebel leaders were executed at York Castle. By the end of the 14th century, the castle bailey was primarily occupied by the local county administration. It was used extensively as a jail, with prisoners being kept in the various towers around the bailey. The old castle guard system for securing the castle had changed into a system whereby the crown used rents from local royal lands to hire local guards for the castle. Increasingly, royalty preferred to stay at the Franciscan friary, between the Castle and King's Staith on the Ouse, while their staff resided at St Mary's Abbey and St Andrew's Priory in the Fishergate area. In the 15th century, York Castle, along with Nottingham Castle, was considered a key security asset in the north of England, but investment even in these castles diminished. Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards, and it fell into increasing disrepair. Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most decrepit structures removed, but he died at the battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence. By the reign of Henry VIII, the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair nonetheless the water defences remained intact, unlike those of many other castles of the period. As a result of the deterioration, Henry had to be advised that the king's councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York. The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553, and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464. The hospital was then closed during the Reformation, and the mills passed into private ownership once again. The castle continued to be used as a jail, increasingly for local felons, and a location for political executions. By the 16th century it had become traditional to execute traitors by hanging them from the top of Clifford's Tower, rather than killing them at Micklegate Bar, the usual previous location for capital punishment in York. In 1536, for example, the political leader Robert Aske was executed at York Castle on the orders of Henry VIII, following the failure of Aske's Pilgrimage of Grace protest against the Dissolution of the Monasteries. For most of the period the sheriffs of Yorkshire remained in control of the castle, although there were some notable exceptions such as the appointment of the royal favourite Sir Robert Ryther by Edward IV in 1478. At the end of the 16th century, however, the Clifford family Earls of Cumberland , became the hereditary constables of the castle, and Clifford's Tower took its name from the family at around this time. The deterioration of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised that it no longer had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling. Maintaining the castle was becoming increasingly expensive, and in 1614 King James sold the lease on Clifford's Tower and the surrounding land to John Babington and Edmund Duffield, a pair of property speculators. In turn, Babington and Duffield sold Clifford's Tower to a York merchant family. In 1642, however, the English Civil War broke out between the rival factions of the Royalists and Parliament. Forces loyal to Charles I, under the command of Henry Clifford, garrisoned York Castle and the surrounding city in 1643. York effectively became the northern capital for the Royalist cause. Clifford repaired the castle and strengthened the walls to permit them to support cannon, placing his arms alongside those of the king above the entrance. Clifford's Tower's gatehouse was substantially remodelled, losing its original medieval appearance. Baile Hill, on the other side of the river, became a gun emplacement. The castle mint was reopened to supply the king's forces with coins. The war turned against the Royalist factions, and on 23 April 1644 Parliamentary forces commenced the siege of York. A Scottish army under Alexander Leslie came from the south, while a Parliamentary force under Ferdinando Fairfax came from the east. Six weeks later, Edward Montagu brought a third contingent to York, bringing the number of forces besieging the city to over 30,000 men. William Cavendish commanded the city during the siege, while Colonel Sir Francis Cobb was appointed the governor of the castle. Despite bombardment, attempts to undermine the walls and attacks on the gates, the city held out through May and June. Prince Rupert, sent to relieve York, approached with reinforcements, and through clever manoeuvring was able to force the besiegers to withdraw, lifting the siege on 1 July. The next day, Parliamentary forces defeated Rupert at the Battle of Marston Moor, six miles west of York, making the surrender of York and the castle inevitable. On 14 July the city and castle surrendered to the Parliamentary forces, who permitted the Royalists to march out with full honours. Parliament then appointed Thomas Dickenson, the local mayor, as the governor of Clifford's Tower. Control of the castle rested with the post of mayor until the Restoration. Efforts were made to separate the structures of Clifford's Tower, which Parliament used as a garrison, from the buildings of the bailey, which continued to be used as a prison. Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford's Tower in 1650, and received a salute from the guns stationed on top of it. The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York. After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre war owners of the property laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs were made to the tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends. The county facilities in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s the role of the military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682 he argued that it would cost at least 30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority. On St George's Day in 1684 at around 10 pm, an explosion in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower entirely. The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts of the woodwork, which later ignited the magazine. Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city to toast the potential demolition of the Minced Pie , as the castle was known to locals suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly pink, colour. The now ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud. By 1701, the conditions of the county jail had become scandalous and the decision was taken to redevelop the area occupied by the old bailey. A local tax helped to fund the development, and the king agreed for the ruins of St Mary's Abbey to be cannibalised for building stone. Three new buildings were erected to the south of Clifford's Tower. A new county jail, built between 1701 and 1705 by William Wakefield, was placed on the south side, closely resembling the fashionable work of John Vanbrugh. The local architect John Carr then built the Assize Courts on the site of the old Jury House between 1773 and 1777 on the west side, and oversaw the replacement of the Sessions House and Common Hall by the Female Prison between 1780 and 1783 on the east side. The Female Prison and county jail were later combined to become the Debtors' Prison. Both of Carr's buildings were designed in a distinctive neoclassical style the Assize Court building was particularly praised at the time as being a superb building of the Ionic order . The castle courtyard was grassed over to form a circle in 1777 and became known as the Eye of the Ridings because it was used for the election of members of parliament for York. Visits by the prison reformer John Howard as part of the research for his book The State of the Prisons found these prisons flawed, but in relatively good condition compared to others at the time. The Debtors' Prison as a whole was an honour to the county of York, with airy and healthy rooms, but the felons' wing of the prison attracted some criticism. The felons' wing was too small and had no water for the inmates felons were forced to sleep on piles of straw on the floor. Indeed, conditions were so bad in the felons' wing that nine prisoners suffocated in one night during 1739. Just outside the main walls, the castle mills had become increasingly ineffective from the 16th century onwards because of a reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise. Criticism of the castle prison increased at the end of the 18th century. The facilities were felt to be inadequate and the crowds of spectators who gathered outside the prison to see inmates being taken into York for execution unseemly. Attempts were made to improve the way executions were carried out from 1803 onwards the former castle courtyard, the Eye of the Ridings, was used for this purpose instead, although crowds still gathered outside the bailey to watch the slow deaths of the prisoners. By 1813 the execution process had been sped up by the introduction of the short drop method of hanging, allowing the unusually rapid execution of fourteen Luddite agitators at the castle in 1814. Overcrowding in the jail was now also a problem, with up to 114 prisoners being held at any one time occasionally, around forty prisoners awaiting trial had to be kept in the jail yard for lack of space elsewhere. The suitability of the prison was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford's Tower and the Waud house, with the aim of demolishing them both to make room for a new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston le Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford's Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An alternative proposal, put forward by architect Robert Wallace, would have seen the conversion of Clifford's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down. In 1825, Clifford's Tower and the Waud house were purchased by the county of Yorkshire at the cost of 8,800 665,000 at 2009 prices . The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse 35 feet 11 metres high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to be the strongest such building in England, was built entirely of stone to be both secure and fireproof. Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated. Clifford's Tower played no part in the formal design of the prison, although the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It was used as the county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead. By the early 19th century, dredging and other improvements to the river Foss had made it possible to import flour into York by river, reducing the economic significance of the castle mills. In 1856, the castle mills were finally demolished as part of a further sequence of improvements to this part of the river. The King's Pool that formed part of the castle's water defences was drained. With the construction of several new bridges near the castle, the site became surrounded by roads instead of moats . Some major trials took place at the Assizes now Crown Court building of York Castle in the 19th century, including that of Mary Fitzpatrick who was accused of murder. In 1890 the Prison Commissioners agreed to declare Clifford's Tower a national monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower was given to the York Corporation, together with a grant of 3,000 242,000 at 2009 prices arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument. York Prison finally closed in 1929, and the Tudor Gothic Victorian prison buildings were demolished in 1935. The Assize Courts building now houses the York Crown Court, while the former Debtors' Prison and Female Prison, together with a modern entrance area, are now the Castle Museum. The circular grassed area between these buildings that was once known as the Eye of the Ridings is now known as Castle Green, or the Eye of York . Clifford's Tower is the most prominent surviving part of the original medieval fortification, although the stone steps up the side of the motte are modern. Fragments of the bailey wall, parts of the south gatehouse and one of the corner towers also survive. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled monument. The site, managed by English Heritage, is open to the public. Until the 1970s, the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official histories of the castle early official guides to the castle made no reference to it. In 1978, however, the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford's Tower, and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower. Recently, commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it. Citizens, visitors, academics, environmentalists, local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development with some success, winning a lengthy and bitter public inquiry in 2003.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York%20Castle
"The 201011 season was the 89th season of competitive association football and seventh season in the Football Conference played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their fifth place finish in 200910 meant it was their seventh successive season in the Conference Premier. The season covers the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. Ahead of Martin Foyle's second start to a season as York manager, six signings were made before the summer transfer window closed. With York 15th in the table 10 matches into the season Foyle resigned, and was succeeded by Tamworth's Gary Mills in October 2010. Under his guidance, York enjoyed an unbeaten run at home in the league that lasted until April 2011, when they were beaten by Mills' former team. York's push for a play off place was ended late in the season and they finished eighth in the table. They reached the third round of the 201011 FA Cup, being beaten 20 away by Bolton Wanderers, and were knocked out in the first round of the 201011 FA Trophy after losing 10 at home to Boston United. 32 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first team competition, and there were 20 different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Michael Ingham and defender James Meredith missed only one of the 52 competitive matches played over the season. Michael Rankine finished as leading scorer with 14 goals, of which 12 came in league competition and two came in the FA Cup. The winner of the Clubman of the Year award, voted for by the club's supporters, was Daniel Parslow for the second time in three seasons. The 200910 season was Martin Foyle's first full season as manager of York City and the team reached the play offs after finishing fifth in the Conference Premier table. After defeating Luton Town 20 on aggregate in the semi final, York were beaten 31 by Oxford United in the 2010 Conference Premier play off Final at Wembley Stadium. Jamie Clarke, Kevin Gall, Josh Mimms, Craig Nelthorpe, Alan O'Hare, Richard Pacquette and Simon Russell were released by York following the play off defeat, with Luke Graham, Ben Purkiss and Adam Smith leaving for Kettering Town, Oxford and Mansfield Town respectively. Andy McWilliams was loaned out to Stalybridge Celtic. Levi Mackin and Djoumin Sangare signed new contracts with the club. Goalkeeper David Knight was brought in on a season long loan from Histon before the start of the season, while two defenders, Duane Courtney and Greg Young, signed from Kidderminster Harriers and Altrincham respectively. Midfielder Jonathan Smith was signed from Forest Green Rovers, with wingers David McDermott and Peter Till joining from Kidderminster and Walsall respectively. Striker George Purcell was signed from Braintree Town for an undisclosed fee. Defender Dean Lisles and winger Jamie Hopcutt entered the first team squad from the youth team after agreeing professional contracts. The team adopted a new home kit, which featured red shirts with white collars, white trims on the shoulders and white sleeves that included red trims. York started the season wearing red shorts with white trims, but these were replaced later in the season with navy blue shorts with white trims. The home kit also included red shorts with white trims. The away kit, retained from the previous season, comprised light blue shirts with white horizontal stripes, light blue shorts and light blue socks. Pryers Solicitors continued as shirt sponsors for the second successive season. York started the season with a 21 defeat at home to Kidderminster Harriers, who opened the scoring with a goal direct from a corner kick. After Michael Rankine equalised on 68 minutes with a penalty, Kidderminster won the match with a penalty three minutes later. Hopcutt was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for a month. The team's first away match of the season was against Grimsby Town, with the match finishing a 00 draw. This was followed by another away draw, with Michael Gash and Till scoring against Bath City as the match finished 22. York then drew 00 at home to Barrow and the team's first victory of the season came after Rankine and Richard Brodie scored to beat Altrincham 30 at home. The team were defeated 21 away by Fleetwood Town, where Young made his debut and scored York's only goal. Brodie joined fellow Conference Premier club Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around 300,000, with the transfer being completed three minutes before the transfer deadline. Following Brodie's departure, two strikers were signed Leon Constantine joined on a contract until the end of the season after leaving Hereford United and youth team coach Steve Torpey was registered as a player. Till and debutant Constantine scored in the space of two minutes in a 20 home win over Rushden Diamonds.

Morecambe took the lead through Paul Mullin before Zubar converted Summerfield's corner with a far post header, and Penn scored the winning goal with a long range strike into the top left hand corner. York were beaten for the first time in seven matches after losing 10 away to promotion contenders Shrewsbury, with Mark Ellis scoring their goal in the first half. York's final home match of the season ended in a 20 defeat to play off chasing Newport, who scored twice in the second half with goals scored by David Tutonda and Lee Minshull, and Hyde had a penalty saved in between the goals. They finished the season after drawing 11 away to Portsmouth Halliday equalised in the 85th minute after capitalising on a slip from Dan Butler, three minutes after Matt Tubbs had given the home team the lead. York's final league position in League Two was 18th, their lowest placing since promotion into that division three years ago. At an awards night held at York Racecourse, Lowe was voted by the club's supporters as the Clubman of the Year for 201415. York were in lower midtable for most of the season, and rose as high as 11th in the table during September 2014 and dropped to 23rd during October and February 2015. The team had the second lowest number of victories in the League Two season with 11 only the two relegated teams, Cheltenham and Tranmere, recorded fewer wins with nine each. For the fourth time in nine seasons, York achieved a better record away than at home in the league. The team won six matches, drew nine and lost eight away, compared to winning five, drawing 10 and losing eight at home. Lowe made the highest number of appearances during the season, appearing in 49 of York's 50 matches. Hyde was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with nine league goals and 10 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Fletcher with seven goals. At the season's end York released Fletcher, Jarvis, Lewis Montrose and Parslow. Carson, Ingham and Platt signed new contracts with the club. Over the close season York signed goalkeeper Scott Flinders from Hartlepool, defenders Taron Hare and Eddie Nolan from Scunthorpe, George Swan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, David Tutonda on loan from Cardiff City and Zubar on loan from Bournemouth, midfielder James Berrett from Yeovil Town, and strikers Vadaine Oliver from Crewe Alexandra and Reece Thompson from Frickley. Midfielder Callum Rzonca was promoted to the first team squad from the youth team after signing a professional contract with the club.

"York Community Stadium is a multi purpose stadium currently under construction in Huntington, York, England. It will be owned by City of York Council, and be shared by York City Football Club and York City Knights Rugby League Football Club. The projected capacity of the all seater stadium is 8,005. The move to a new stadium was necessitated by the terms of the loan York City secured from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund to purchase their Bootham Crescent ground. Planning permission for the current design, put forward by Greenwich Leisure, was granted in March 2015. After several delays, construction began in December 2017, for completion in mid 2019. In addition to the stadium, the site will house a leisure complex and a community hub. York City F.C. ceased ownership of their Bootham Crescent ground in the summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a 2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund FSIF to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation. As part of the loan agreement, Persimmon have first refusal on purchasing Bootham Crescent once York City leave, for 10 lower than its market value. Persimmon still intend to build 93 homes on the site, and the proceeds of the sale would go towards building the new stadium. In March 2008, York City's managing director Jason McGill cited the annual cost of 60,000 for the maintenance and upkeep of a 1932 stadium with few commercial and income generating opportunities as the reason for the continued need to move to a new stadium. York City had identified a preferred site for a new stadium by April 2007, but were unable to disclose the location due to confidentiality clauses. Despite the club failing to formally identify a site by the end of 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had stalled by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York City and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. A project board was established in January 2009, with the objective of ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option. Developers Oakgate Monks Cross Ltd submitted a planning application for a community stadium, for use by York City and York City Knights, and a retail park in September 2011. The council granted planning permission for the development in May 2012, with the stadium expected to be ready during the 201415 season. Gavin Aitchison of The Press commented that one of York's biggest planning controversies in years finally came to a head after the planning committee meeting that lasted over eight hours. Critics argued the development would damage the city centre economy, with a report by Deloitte saying the development would cost the city centre 50 million a year. In November 2012, construction was delayed until June 2014, for a completion date of July 2015. A delay to the construction of the shopping park in June 2013, caused by the discovery of protected great crested newts at the site, meant the stadium completion date was moved to January 2016. In August 2014, Greenwich Leisure GLL were named as the council's preferred bidder to deliver an 8,000 all seater stadium, to be shared by York City and York City Knights, and a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction was due to start during spring 2015, for a completion date of July 2016. York City were given responsibility for operating and managing the stadium on an initial 13 year contract. A planning application for the GLL plan was submitted to the council in December 2014, which was passed in March 2015. The cost of the stadium and leisure complex, including a replacement athletics track at another site, stood at 37 million. In July 2015, construction was delayed as contracts were still being finalised, and the completion date was moved to during the 201617 season. Construction was delayed again a month later, with work to begin in February or March 2016, for completion in April or May 2017. With construction costs increasing due to more detailed design work, construction inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional 7.2 million in March 2016, raising the total cost of the project to 44.2 million. Construction was delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018. A judicial review of the development was launched in October 2016 by Vue Cinemas, who objected to an extra screen being approved at the site. Later that year, principal contractor ISG withdrew, citing rising costs and the judicial review, which was settled in the City of York's favour in January 2017. By May that year, construction had not yet began nor had a new contractor been found. In November, the council stated that work would begin on the stadium before the end of the year, to be opened for the 201920 season. Construction began on 4 December 2017. The stadium will host both women semi finals of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. The stadium is projected to have an all seated capacity of 8,005. It will comprise four stands the East Stand Main Stand , the West Stand, the North Stand and the South Stand. The three floored East Stand is to accommodate hospitality guests, players, officials and the media, and will be connected to the adjacent retail and community facilities. The stands will stretch the length of the playing field, and each corner will host stadium facilities, including matchday emergency services, stewarding, groundsman accommodation, plant space and a fan zone. The seats will be coloured red, white and blue, a combination of the colours of both teams. The pitch will use reinforced natural grass, with provision to counter frost. The dimensions for football matches will be 105 by 68 metres 115 by 74 yd , with 3 metre wide run offs on the sides and 6.5 metre wide run offs behind the goals, which will meet FIFA recommendations. The dimensions for rugby league matches will be 100 by 68 metres 109 by 74 yd , with 6 metre in goal areas, and 3 metre wide run offs on the sides and after the dead ball lines. Adjoining the stadium will be the leisure complex, which will include a 25 metre, six lane swimming pool, a sports hall for netball, badminton and basketball, a gym with dance and spinning studios, an adventure sports zone and three 3G five a side pitches. A community hub will house health and well being services for York residents and visitors, including clinical services, an independent living assessment centre and a library. Regular bus services will serve the stadium from the city centre, and additional services to other areas will be considered if there is sufficient demand. A review of the park and ride operating times will take place, with an extension to the service to be sought. On matchdays, 400 car parking places and 355 cycle parking places will be available at the stadium. A cycle route exists between the site and the city centre.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York%20Community%20Stadium
"The York Museum Gardens are botanic gardens in the centre of York, England, beside the River Ouse. They cover an area of 10 acres 4.0 ha of the former grounds of St Mary's Abbey, and were created in the 1830s by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society along with the Yorkshire Museum which they contain. The gardens are held in trust by the City of York Council and are managed by the York Museums Trust. They were designed in a gardenesque style by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith, and contain a variety of species of plants, trees and birds. Admission is free. A variety of events take place in the gardens, such as open air theatre performances and festival activities. There are several historic buildings in the gardens. They contain the remains of the west corner of the Roman fort of Eboracum, including the Multangular Tower and parts of the Roman walls. In the same area there is also the Anglian Tower, which was probably built into the remains of a late Roman period fortress. During the Middle Ages, the tower was expanded and the Roman walls were incorporated into York's city walls. Most of the other buildings dating from the Middle Ages are associated with St Mary's Abbey, including the ruins of the abbey church, the Hospitium, the lodge and part of the surviving precinct wall. The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th century, including the Yorkshire Museum and its octagonal observatory. The museum houses four permanent collections, covering biology, geology, archaeology and astronomy. The gardens, which were given to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society by the British Royal Family in 1828, occupy part of the former grounds of St. Mary's Abbey. The society acquired the land to build a museum to house its collections the Yorkshire Museum was completed in 1830. The land was granted to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society under the condition that botanical gardens would be established on the site. These were created during the 1830s in a gardenesque style design by landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith. They originally contained a conservatory, a pond and a menagerie, which was destroyed when a bear escaped from it and had brief control of the area. The then Princess Victoria visited the gardens in 1835, the year that they were first open to the public. In 1854 the gardens were described as one of the principal attractions of York . At this time entrance as free to members and for non members entrance cost one shilling except on Saturday when it cost six pence. In 1960, the gardens and the Yorkshire Museum were given in trust to the City of York Council and they became a public park. Since 2002, they have been managed by the York Museums Trust, along with York Castle Museum and York Art Gallery. The gardens are maintained by the Askham Bryan College of Agriculture. York Museum Gardens cover an area of 10 acres 4.0 ha on the north bank of the River Ouse, just outside the city walls in the centre of York. There are four entrances to the gardens on Marygate off Bootham by St Olave's Church, on Museum Street by Lendal Bridge, via a path at the side of King's Manor, and from the riverside walk next to the River Ouse. The site slopes gently down towards the river and is made up of historical buildings and undulating lawns interspersed with plants and trees. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours, so the opening and closing times vary throughout the year. Normally admission is free but there are charges for some events. In 2010 it was estimated that the gardens attract 1.3 million visitors a year. Drinking alcohol, cycling and ball games are not allowed in the gardens. There are approximately 4,500 plants and trees in the collection, some of the varieties native to England and some from other parts of the world. Planting consists of large beds containing predominantly shrubs and trees, and lawns interspersed with individual trees. Species of tree include a monkey puzzle tree along with oak and chestnut trees three of the trees in the gardens are classed as United Kingdom champion trees. There is a rockery next to the Marygate entrance, by the ruins of the abbey church, and in front of the entrance to the Yorkshire Museum there is a terrace bordered with beds of white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire. There is an 'Edible Wood' located behind York Art Gallery, in the north west corner of the gardens. The wood was planted in July 2015 and features plants that have an edible component and are both attractive and useful. The gardens are home to a population of semi tame grey squirrels and many species of birds. A 1970 report covering the period 1965 1969 listed the vertebrates resident in the gardens at that time Common wood pigeon, Tawny owl, Blue tit, Eurasian Wren, Dunnock, European Robin, European greenfinch, Mistle thrush, Song thrush, Blackbird, and House sparrow, Common shrew, Wood mouse, and Brown rat. In the early 19th century, the gardens included a menagerie. Henry Baines' daughter, Fanny, recalled 70 years later that in this period the menageries contained a bear, a golden eagle, and several monkeys, amongst other animals. In 1831, a bear from the menagerie got loose in the gardens and reportedly chased the Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum, John Phillips, and Reverent Harcourt into an outbuilding. The bear was subsequently sent to London Zoo. Until 2006 a family of peacocks had been in residence for at least 70 years. In 2012 the gardens was one of the release sites for a new population of the endangered Tansy beetle and, as of 2015, is one of the best places to see them in the wild. There is a geological oddity close to the main gates, consisting of a large boulder of pink granite that was discovered during construction of the city's railway station. Since this type of stone is not local it was determined as having been transported there from Shap in Cumbria by glacial action during the last ice age. 2015, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the publication of the geological map of Britain by William Smith, a mosaic map was commissioned for the Gardens from artist Janette Ireland which shows the geological strata of Yorkshire in pebbles of the corresponding stone. As well as being a popular recreational space for both residents and visitors, the gardens are the venue for special events such as open air theatre and music performances. The gardens are the location of York's Saluting Station, one of only 12 in the United Kingdom, with 21 gun salutes being fired at noon to celebrate occasions related to the British Royal Family throughout the year. At these times a military band marches to the gardens before the salute is fired. In 1970, bands including Roxy Music, Hawkwind and Pink Fairies staged concerts,in 2007 The Lord Chamberlain's Men presented a production of Romeo Juliet. Other events and performances include There is a designated 'Artist's Garden' behind the Art Gallery, within the Museum Gardens. Sculptural works are displayed in this open air space. Exhibitions in this space have included In the northeast of Museum Gardens there are remains of the west corner of the fortifications that surrounded the Roman fort of Eboracum. The original defences, consisting of turf ramparts on a green wood foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74 AD. Later those were replaced by a clay mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers. These stone defences are some of the few Roman remains that are visible above ground in York. The Multangular Tower is the western corner tower of the Roman fortress, and consists of both Roman and medieval architecture. The tower has 10 sides, from which it derives its modern name multangular , and is 19 feet 5.8 m high. It was built in its late Roman form during the early 4th century, when it was constructed with three floors to house a catapult. Five Roman stone coffins are in the Multangular Tower, which were brought from graveyards in other areas of York. A 76 foot 23 m section of 4th century wall connects the Multangular Tower to a small interval tower. The side of the wall and towers facing into Museum Gardens is carefully faced in stone, as during the Roman period it was on display. The other side is rougher because it was originally covered by an earth bank. The wall and towers were still in use after the end of the Roman period in Britain, and were subsequently incorporated into the medieval city walls. As late as the English Civil War they were being used to defend the city, and there is a hole in the wall along from the Multangular Tower that was made by a cannonball during this period. The Roman parts of the wall and towers are constructed of regular rectangular limestone blocks with a band of red tile running through them. The later medieval additions can be identified by the use of much larger blocks of limestone that cut through the red tiles in places and by the cross shaped arrow slits on the Multangular Tower. To the north of the Multangular Tower there is a stretch of the medieval city wall with the remains of the original Roman wall running parallel to it on the city side. Built into this part of the wall is the stone Anglian Tower, which was once thought to have been built during the reign of Edwin of Northumbria, but now is generally thought to be of the very late Roman period. Behind the Anglian Tower are a series of banks showing the level of the defences during the Roman, early Middle Ages, Norman, and late medieval periods. The gardens contain several buildings dating back to the medieval period, most of them relating to St Mary's Abbey. The Benedictine Abbey's origins date back to 1086 when Alan Count of Brittany granted St Olave's Church and the adjoining land to the monk Stephen of Whitby, who became the first abbot of St. Mary's. When St Olave's Church became too small, a larger church in a Romanesque style was built nearby, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1089 by William II. This was replaced between 1270 and 1279 by a church in a Gothic style. The abbey became the wealthiest monastery in the North of England, worth over 2,085 a year before it was dissolved by Henry VIII on 25 November 1539. Over the next 200 years the abbey fell into disrepair and the abbey church was largely dismantled for its stone. Stones from the abbey church can be seen lining paths throughout the gardens, but the major ruins of the church are on the western side. The church was aligned on a northeast axis because of the shape and size of the site, instead of pointing to the east, the normal alignment for churches in England. Part of the north and west walls that formed the nave and crossing, designed in Gothic style by architect Simon of Pabenham in the 13th century, remain standing. The ruins include dummy lancet windows, tracery windows and tracery remains to show that the patterns alternated between a single large circle over two lights and three small circles over three lights . The column capitals are decorated with foliage in a stiff leaf style as well as in a naturalistic style, although this stonework is weatherworn and so this decoration is hard to distinguish. Sections of the foundations of the church and its Norman predecessor are exposed, and a plan of their layouts can be seen in the grass. Finds excavated from the site, including life sized statues of Christian saints, can be seen in the Yorkshire Museum. St Mary's Lodge was built around 1470 as an addition to the late 12th century buildings that formed the gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey, now the Marygate entrance to the gardens. Some remains of the 12th century gatehouse can still be seen, in particular the archway attached to the side of the lodge. The lodge is built of stone, and does not contain timber framing like the nearby Hospitium. The lodge, along with the attached railings, gates and gate piers are all Grade I listed buildings, which means that they are of outstanding interest. Originally, the lodge may have been used as a guesthouse for the abbey, and was the point where the poor could claim alms from the abbey. After the abbey's dissolution, the lodge became a courthouse until 1722, when part of the building became the Brown Cow pub. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's curator, restored and converted it to use as his home while retaining its external appearance. The lodge subsequently became used as offices, and during the early 21st century became the headquarters of the York Museums Trust. Along with the lodge, some of the abbey's precinct walls are still standing. A section of the remaining walls runs along the north west part of the gardens and extends further along Marygate to Bootham. The walls were constructed in 1266 and increased in height and crenellated in 1318 under a royal licence from Edward III. Originally there was a defensive ditch along the outside of the walls. The walls include several towers, not all of them dating from the medieval period the semicircular tower near the gatehouse is a 19th century reconstruction. The walls and towers were used for the abbey's defence, e.g. in disputes with the City of York over land ownership and taxes, and played a role in the defence of the city during the Siege of York. The Hospitium is located between the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and is thought to have originally been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally part of a group of buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably the entrance to a passage that ran towards the water gate by the river. The remains of St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft are on the east side of the gardens, by the Museum Street entrance. The hospital was the largest in England during the Middle Ages, and was run by a community of men and women of the Augustinian order. During the 14th century, the hospital could have contained as many as 240 patients, 18 clergy and 30 choristers. St. Leonard's Hospital was closed during the dissolution of the monasteries, when it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Magnus. The undercroft and chapel were part of the infirmary built between 1225 and 1250. The interior of the undercroft, accessible from the gardens, has a rib vaulted ceiling and houses a collection of Roman and medieval stonework. In 1999, the hospital and surrounding area in Museum Gardens was one of three sites in York to feature in an edition of the British Channel 4 television show Time Team. Between the Museum Street entrance to the gardens and the River Ouse is a short stretch of York's city walls, which ends at the medieval Lendal Tower. William Hincks was instrumental in establishing the gardens. Henry John Wilkinson reports as follows Mr. Hincks was lecturer on botany at the York School of Medicine, and the services he rendered to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for over ten years deserve our grateful thanks. He devoted his leisure time to convert the waste land into a botanical and ornamental garden, and in this work he was ably assisted by the late sub curator, Henry Baines. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society constructed several buildings in the gardens during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Yorkshire Museum, one of the first purpose built museums in Britain. The Yorkshire Museum was designed by architect William Wilkins in a Greek Revival style and was officially opened in February 1830. On 26 September 1831 the inaugural meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the Yorkshire Museum. Three of the museum's permanent collections are housed in the Yorkshire Museum building all of which have English designated collection status, which means they are pre eminent collections of national and international importance . The biology collection contains 200,000 specimens, including both fauna and flora, with most of the collection made up of insects. There are two stuffed specimens of the extinct great auk, an almost complete skeleton of an extinct moa and a large collection of specimens from the Yorkshire region including the remains of elephants, cave bears and hyena from Kirkdale Cave dated to the Quaternary period, around 125,000 years ago. The geological collection contains over 112,500 specimens of rocks, minerals and fossils. Fossils make up most of the collection numbering over 100,000 samples, and include important specimens from the Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Tertiary periods. The archaeology collection has close to a million objects that date from around 500,000 BC to the 20th century, including the Coppergate Helmet discovered in York in 1982, and the Ormside Bowl, an intricate example of an Anglian silversmith. Most of the museum's astronomy collection is housed in the octagonal observatory in the centre of the gardens, built during 1832 and 1833. The design of its rotating roof is credited to John Smeaton designer of the Eddystone Lighthouse. A 4.5 inch 11 cm telescope built in 1850 by the instrument maker Thomas Cooke of York was installed during the observatory's 1981 restoration. It is Yorkshire's oldest working observatory and as of August 2007 was opened to the public by a team of volunteers. The building is currently opened every Thursday and Saturday 11.30 until 2.30. The clock in the observatory was made by Barraud of London in 1811, and during the 19th century it was used to set the time for other clocks in York. At the eastern, Museum Street, entrance to the gardens is Museum Gardens' Lodge built in 1874 to a design by George Fowler Jones in a Victorian Gothic revival style. The lodge now houses the Yorkshire Philosophical Society's offices and reading room. The curator's house, built in 1844 and originally called the keeper's house, is located by King's Manor. It was designed by J B Atkinson and was built using reclaimed limestone from St. Mary's Abbey. The Tempest Anderson Hall is a 300 seat auditorium style lecture theatre built in 1912 as an annexe to the Yorkshire Museum. Dr Tempest Anderson, a York surgeon and vulcanologist, presented the hall to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society to replace its existing lecture theatre. Designed by E Ridsdale Tate, it is an early example of the use of reinforced concrete and is a Grade I listed building. In the late 20th century it housed a cinema, but it is now used as a conference venue and lecture theatre. York's first swimming bath was located in the south west corner of the Museum Gardens. It was an open air pool designed by the architects Samuel and Richard Hey Sharp, one of the designers of the Yorkshire Museum, and measured 110 feet 34 m by 80 feet 24 m and had a capacity of approximately 290,000 gallons. It opened to the public on 8 August 1837, and employed a Keeper of the baths throughout its lifespan.

"USS Yorktown Gunboat No. 1 PG 1 was lead ship of her class of steel hulled, twin screw gunboats in the United States Navy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was the second U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the American Revolutionary War's Battle of Yorktown. Yorktown was laid down by William Cramp Sons of Philadelphia in May 1887 and launched in April 1888. She was just over 244 feet 74 m long and 36 feet 11 m abeam, and displaced 1,710 long tons 1,740 t . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner rigged masts. The ship's main battery consisted of six 6 inch 15.2 cm guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller caliber guns. At launch, Yorktown joined the Squadron of Evolution of New Navy steel hulled ships. Detached from that squadron, Yorktown, under the command of Robley D. Evans, sailed to Valparaiso, Chile, during the 1891 Baltimore Crisis and relieved USS Baltimore at that port. After that situation was resolved, Yorktown took part in the joint BritishAmerican sealing patrol in Alaskan waters and duty on the Asiatic Station before returning to the United States in 1898. Yorktown was out of commission during the SpanishAmerican War, but took part in actions in the PhilippineAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion in 1899 and 1900, respectively, after she had been recommissioned. After three years out of commission from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted the Secretary of the Navy on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1908. Over the next five years, most of Yorktown's time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919. She was sold in 1921 to an Oakland, California firm and broken up that same year. The Yorktown class gunboatsunofficially considered third class cruiserswere the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. Yorktown was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William Cramp Sons shipyard of Philadelphia. The hull for Yorktown was designed by the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the Cramp yard. Yorktown's keel was laid on 14 May 1887. The ship was launched on 28 April 1888 and sponsored by Mary Cameron, the daughter of U.S. Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania. The dynamite gun cruiser Vesuvius was launched a few minutes after Yorktown in the same ceremony. According to a news account, 25 United States Senators, 180 Congressmen, the Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney, and the governors of six states attended the dual ceremony, many arriving from Washington, D.C., via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's passenger steamer SS Columbia. By 19 March 1889, Cramp had completed Yorktown and was prepared to turn her over to the Navy. As built, Yorktown was 244 feet 5 inches 74.50 m in length and 36 feet 11 m abeam. Her steel hull had an average draft of 14 feet 4 m , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water. At the waterline was a turtleback deck of 38 inch 9.5 mm steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces. The deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to 3 feet 0.91 m below the waterline at the sides of the ship. Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle. Above the armored deck, Yorktown had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them. The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval shaped to deflect shot. It was outfitted with a steam powered steering wheel, a telegraph, and speaking tubes it was protected by 2 inches 51 mm of steel armor plate. Yorktown was powered by two triple expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of 10.5 foot 3.2 m , three bladed screw propellers. The cylinders of each engine were 22, 31, and 51 inches 56, 79, and 130 cm in diameter and had a 30 inch 76 cm stroke. Each engine was rated at 3,400 indicated horsepower 2,500 kW and together were designed to move the ship at 16 knots 30 km h , though the ship exceeded that in her trials. The engines, situated in separate watertight compartments, were each fed by a pair of coal fired boilers. Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was 9 feet 6 inches 2.90 m in diameter and 17 feet 6 inches 5.33 m in length with a total grate area of 220 square inches 1,400 cm2 . Yorktown's coal bunkers could carry up to 400 long tons 410 t of the fuel, and were shielded from shot and shell . At a near top speed of 16 knots, the ship could cover 2,800 nautical miles 5,200 km in 612 days at the more economical speed of 8 knots 15 km h she could cruiser 12,000 nautical miles 22,000 km over 62 days. To supplement her steam power plant, Yorktown was built with three masts that were schooner rigged. She had a total sail area of 6,300 square feet 590 m2 . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow Yorktown to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime. Yorktown's main battery consisted of six 6 inch 152 mm 30 caliber Mark 3 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of 11,000 pounds 5,000 kg . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck, two on the poop deck, and the other pair amidships on the gun deck. The two guns on the gun deck were mounted 10 feet 3.0 m above the waterline, while the other four were 18 feet 5.5 m above. The guns fired 105 pound 48 kg armor piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing 18.8 pounds 8.5 kg at 1,950 feet per second 590 m s . At an elevation of 30.2, the guns had a range of 18,000 yards 16,000 m . Each gun was shielded with steel plating 3 inches 76 mm thick. Yorktown's secondary battery consisted of two 6 pounder 57 mm 2.24 in guns, two 3 pounder 47 mm 1.85 in guns, and two 1 pounder 37 mm 1.46 in guns. All were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss. According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication, an armor piercing round fired from a 6 pounder gun could penetrate 2 inches 51 mm of armor at a distance of 1,000 yards 910 m . The ship was commissioned at the League Island Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 April 1889 under the command of Commander French E. Chadwick. After Yorktown conducted her final sea trials, she was assigned to the Squadron of Evolution sometimes also referred to as the White Squadron in late 1889. Yorktown operated with that unit as it developed tactical maneuvers for use by the new steel hulled naval vessels then coming into service in the United States Navy. After this duty, Yorktown departed the east coast of the United States on 7 December 1889, bound for European waters stopped briefly at Fayal in the Azores and arrived at Lisbon, Portugal, two days before Christmas. The ship subsequently cruised the Mediterranean into the early spring of the following year, calling at ports in Spain, Morocco, France, Italy, Greece, and Malta. Following her return to the United States on 17 June 1890, the warship entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard on 1 July for repairs that lasted until 8 August. Upon the completion of these alterations, Yorktown took part in the ceremonies marking the embarkation of the remains of the noted inventor, John Ericssonof Monitor famefor transportation back to his native Sweden for burial. Yorktown next again operated in the Squadron of Evolution off the eastern seaboard and into the Gulf of Mexico into the summer of 1891. Under Acting Rear Admiral John Grimes Walker, the squadron normally cruised in the Gulf of Mexico from January to April and off the east coast from May to October. While in the gulf, the ships called at Galveston, Texas New Orleans and Pensacola, Florida and carried out target practice in Tampa Bay. Later, the squadron conducted small arms practice at Yorktown, Virginia, after arriving at Hampton Roads. In July 1891, the squadron carried out exercises and maneuvers in connection with the naval militias of New York and Massachusetts during which it added torpedo attacks upon the Fleet to the usual target practices. In addition, it conducted drills and landing exercises. The Secretary of the Navy's report for the fiscal year 1891 noted that useful experience had been gained by the Squadron of Evolution in the training of commanding, navigating, and watch officers in skillfully and safely maneuvering vessels in formation and in restricted waters. In addition, engineers were trained in regulating and maintaining economical coal consumption. On 8 October 1891, Yorktown, under the command of Commander Robley D. Evans, departed New York to join the Pacific Squadron. The gunboat put into Charlotte Amalie, Danish West Indies, to coal ship on 14 October. While the ship was engaged in this duty, Yorktown was ordered to Valparaiso, Chile, in response to the Baltimore Crisis. During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, the Itata, a cargo ship employed by Chilean Congressionalists, had loaded weaponry in California, but was detained in San Diego by U.S. officials. After Itata was able to slip away from San Diego, Charleston caught up with the ship at the Chilean port of Iquique in July 1891 and escorted the ship back to San Diego before her cargo could be unloaded. In October, some months after the Itata Incident had ended, the American cruiser Baltimore put in at Valparaiso. On 16 October, a group of sailors from Baltimore ashore on liberty were attacked by Congressionalists, still angry at the Itata affair. Two of Baltimore's sailors were killed and eighteen wounded thirty six other American sailors were arrested by the local authorities. Tensions ran high in both Chile and the United States. Yorktown, a part of the United States' response, departed Charlotte Amalie for Valparaiso on 17 October for a six week, storm tossed voyage around the South American continent via the Straits of Magellan. Less than two weeks after Yorktown's 30 November arrival, Baltimore departed, leaving American interests in the hands of Evans and Yorktown. Over the ensuing weeks, Chile and the United States came close to war, but cooler heads prevailed. Locally, Evans' patience was dangerously tested , but it held. One inflammatory incident occurred when Chilean torpedo boats bore down on Evans' ship, turning their helms hard over at the last possible instant to avoid a collision. On another occasion, a group of locals threw rocks at Evans and his gig as it lay at the foot of a jetty. After a month at Valparaiso, Yorktown took on refugees from the American, Spanish, and Italian legations in mid January 1892. She got underway on the 19th and arrived at Callao, Peru, on the 25th. While Yorktown lay anchored there, tension between the United States and Chile relaxed and the crisis abated, and the Chilean later government provided compensation for the families of the American sailors that were killed. Yorktown stood out of Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via San Diego and San Francisco, and eventually arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there until late in the following month. Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident, Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that, if handled wrongly, could have caused ill feeling with the British. That spring, Yorktownalong with two other naval vessels and a trio of revenue cuttersheaded toward Arctic waters on 27 April to protect the great herds of seals in the Bering Sea from poachers. Traveling along the west coast of the United States, the gunboat and her crew braced , in Evans' words, at the prospect of doing something . As at Valparaiso, Evans faced the possibility of becoming involved in an international incident arising from possible confrontations with Canadian sealers. Operating under the protection of the British crown, the latter had taken particularly heavy catches. Many American vessels put to sea under the British flag in an attempt to evade prosecution by their own government. The British agreed to help put an end to the slaughter of seals and decided upon joint action with the United States in prosecuting the poachers. About 110 schooners, large and small, made up the sealing fleet, typically armed with double barrelled shotguns for killing the animals and Winchester rifles for dealing with any humans who attempted to interfere. The fact that the great majority of seals killed had been female still with young in many casesalmost doubled the toll of slain seals. As Evans noted the slaughter in the North Pacific was fearful . Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, arriving at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on in spite of the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon. Besides the patrols made during this deployment in northwestern waters, Yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers assigned to the ship at that time was Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske's sight had been tested in Baltimore and had favorably impressed that ship's officersincluding her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board Yorktown the first one had failed miserably . On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled target practice, Fiske's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the Americanoff Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in Yorktown. Yorktown continued her task of patrolling until 21 September when she departed Unalaska for the Mare Island Navy Yard. From 11 to 24 October, the ship underwent repairs there before proceeding on to the east coast via Cape Horn. Yorktown eventually arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 February 1893. After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July, Yorktown retraced her route south and sailed again around Cape Horn back into the Pacific. She then moved north to resume patrolling the Bering Sea. She protected seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to Mare Island for repairs which lasted into mid September. On 24 September 1894, Yorktown sailed for the western Pacific and duty on the Asiatic Station. Sailing via Honolulu, she reached Yokohama, Japan, on 8 December 1894 and spent the next three years, under the command of Commander Charles Stockton touching at the principal ports of call along the coasts of China and Japan. She departed Yokohama early in the autumn of 1897 and made port at Mare Island on 18 November 1897. Subsequently, laid up at Mare Island and decommissioned on 8 December, the gunboat remained inactive there through the SpanishAmerican War in 1898. Recommissioned on 17 November 1898, with Commander Charles S. Sperry in command, Yorktown sailed again for the Far East on 7 January 1899. Rumors of German machinations in Samoa lengthened Yorktown's stay at Hawaii from a few days to a few weeks but, when the anticipated trouble failed to materialize, Yorktown resumed her voyage to the Philippine Islands. On 23 February, she arrived at Cavite Navy Yard, near Manila where patrolled to prevent gun runners thought to be supplying guns and ammunition to the Insurrectos, Filipinos fighting for independence. At one point, rumors flew concerning possible German gun running activities and Yorktown patrolled off the entrance to Subic Bay and from thence to Lingayen to keep a lookout for the filibusters. She continued coastal patrol work over the next three years, cooperating with the Army, transporting and convoying troops, and patrolling wide areas of often badly charted waters. Upon occasion, Yorktown served as mother ship to smaller gunboats, providing officers and men to staff the smaller patrol craft. Ensigns William Harrison Standley and Harry E. Yarnell both future admirals and future naval historian and archivist Dudley Wright Knox were among the junior officers who served in Yorktown during this time. During the PhilippineAmerican War, Yorktown stood in to Baler Bay, on the west coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish garrison that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed two were mortally wounded and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship. In 1899, the situation in China worsened until it culminated in the Boxer Rebellion. The following spring, Yorktown was withdrawn from her patrol duties in the northern Philippines to provide assistance to the operations off the coast of North China. She departed Manila on 3 April 1900, bound for China and, after she reached the mainland, her landing force served ashore at Taku. In addition, Marines from Yorktown participated in the actions at Tientsin between June and July. Under the command of Commander Edward D. Taussig from June 1900 to June 1901, she continued to support the China Relief Expedition forces. In June 1900, she assisted Oregon back off a reef near that Chinese port. The gunboat departed Shanghai on 10 September 1900 and reached Cavite on the 17th. In the Philippines, she resumed her cooperation with Army forces, still engaged in pacification operations, and continued these duties for the next two years. In between pacification missions, she performed survey work at Guam in November 1901 and at Dumanquillas Bay, Philippines, in February 1903. In April 1902, Yorktown's Coxswain Joseph Quick rescued a shipmate from drowning while the ship was in port at Yokohama, Japan. For his efforts, Quick was awarded a peacetime Medal of Honor. Yorktown departed the Far East in early 1903 and returned to Mare Island on 3 June. Two weeks later, on the 17th, she was decommissioned. Recommissioned at Mare Island on 1 October 1906, with Commander Richard T. Mulligan in command, Yorktown was fitted out there until 9 November. Underway on that day, she operated off the west coasts of Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua into the following summer. After repairs at San Francisco and Mare Island, Yorktown conducted target practice at Magdalena Bay, Mexico, and relieved Albany as station ship at Acapulco. She then cruised with the 2d Squadron of the Pacific Fleet to Magdalena Bay and San Francisco. Over the ensuing months, Yorktown continued her regular local operations. Yorktown hosted the Secretary of the Navy, Victor H. Metcalf, to witness the arrival of the Great White Fleetcommanded by Yorktown's former commander, Robley Fightin' Bob Evansinto San Francisco. The fleet arrived on 6 May 1908, and the flagship Connecticut saluted the secretary's flag on Yorktown with the discharge of seventeen guns. Metcalf also boarded Yorktown on the 8th to review the assembled battleships, armored cruisers, and torpedo boats of the Pacific and Great White Fleets. On 30 May 1908, Yorktown participated in festivities for the Rose Festival at Portland, Oregon. From June to September, Yorktown conducted seal patrols in Alaskan waters, out of Nome, Unalaska, and Sitka and, between 15 and 19 September, established a site for a wireless station at Valdez. Afterwards, Yorktown sailed south to rejoin the Pacific Fleet, conducting battle practices between 19 November and 1 December at Magdalena Bay. She later joined the armored cruisers West Virginia and Colorado and the tender Glacier at Acajutla, El Salvador, before sailing for Corinto, Nicaragua, in March 1909. After more target practices at Magdalena Bay, Yorktown was repaired at Mare Island in June and into July before shifting to Seattle, to participate in festivities for the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Later in July, the ship visited Esquimalt, British Columbia. She subsequently cruised off the Pacific coast and participated in the Portola Festival at San Francisco in October. From 13 December 1909 to 27 March 1910, Yorktown operated off Corinto, Nicaragua, with the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron. She then pursued a schedule of exercises and maneuvers, operating between California and British Columbia through June and July. She returned to a posture of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September. She then operated off Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian ports, with the United States Consul General at Large embarked, between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores. She subsequently patrolled at Amapala, Honduras, and the familiar Corinto for most of November and December. She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala, en route to San Francisco and Mare Island. From March to July 1911, Yorktown cruised off the west coasts of Mexico, Nicaragua, and Honduras. On 29 May, she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer Taboga, which had sunk with the loss of 60 of its 100 passengers and crew. Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 proceeded the ship's duties off the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She returned to Mare Island in May 1912, and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July. Recommissioned on 1 April 1913, with Commander George B. Bradshaw in command, Yorktown operated out of San Diego on shakedown into mid April. She was soon back at Corinto, however, remaining in Nicaragua until 5 June. After a brief period of operations off the coast, she returned to Corinto on 21 June and remained there for over a month before departing on 31 July to coal at Salina Cruz, Mexico. She moved to Mazatlan on 10 August and there picked up mail, delivering it to the port of Topolobampo, Mexico, on the 11th. Yorktown remained there until mid September. For the remainder of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports Mazatlan, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served in Mexican waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego. After the United States joined the Allies, Yorktown operated off the coast of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island. From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California. Arriving at San Diego on 15 February 1919, Yorktown was placed out of commission at Mare Island on 12 June 1919. On 17 June 1920, she was assigned the hull number PG 1. The veteran steel hulled gunboat was sold to the Union Hide Company of Oakland, California, on 30 September 1921 she was broken up in Oakland sometime after that.

The result of the campaign was the surrender of the British Army force of General Charles Earl Cornwallis, an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. The campaign was marked by disagreements, indecision, and miscommunication on the part of British leaders, and by a remarkable set of cooperative decisions, at times in violation of orders, by the French and Americans. The campaign involved land and naval forces of Great Britain and France, and land forces of the United States. British forces were sent to Virginia between January and April 1781 and joined with Cornwallis's army in May, which came north from an extended campaign through the southern states. These forces were first opposed weakly by Virginia militia, but General George Washington sent first Marquis de Lafayette and then Anthony Wayne with Continental Army troops to oppose the raiding and economic havoc the British were wreaking. The combined American forces, however, were insufficient in number to oppose the combined British forces, and it was only after a series of controversially confusing orders by General Sir Henry Clinton, the British commander in chief, that Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in July and built a defensive position that was strong against the land forces he then faced, but was vulnerable to naval blockade and siege. British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain, and, after some critical decisions and tactical missteps by British naval commanders, the French fleet of Paul de Grasse gained control over Chesapeake Bay, blockading Cornwallis from naval support and delivering additional land forces to blockade him on land. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this control, but Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated in the key Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5. American and French armies that had massed outside New York City began moving south in late August, and arrived near Yorktown in mid September. Deceptions about their movement successfully delayed attempts by Clinton to send more troops to Cornwallis. The Siege of Yorktown began on September 28, 1781. In a step that probably shortened the siege, Cornwallis decided to abandon parts of his outer defenses, and the besiegers successfully stormed two of his redoubts. When it became clear that his position was untenable, Cornwallis opened negotiations on October 17 and surrendered two days later. When the news reached London, the government of Lord North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognized the independent United States of America. Clinton and Cornwallis engaged in a public war of words defending their roles in the campaign, and British naval command also discussed the navy's shortcomings that led to the defeat. By December 1780, the American Revolutionary War's North American theaters had reached a critical point. The Continental Army had suffered major defeats earlier in the year, with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in the loss of Charleston and the Battle of Camden in the south, while the armies of George Washington and the British commander in chief for North America, Sir Henry Clinton watched each other around New York City in the north. The national currency was virtually worthless, public support for the war, about to enter its sixth year, was waning, and army troops were becoming mutinous over pay and conditions. In the Americans' favor, Loyalist recruiting in the south had been checked with a severe blow at Kings Mountain in October. Virginia had largely escaped military notice before 1779, when a raid destroyed much of the state's shipbuilding capacity and seized or destroyed large amounts of tobacco, which was a significant trade item for the Americans. Virginia's only defenses consisted of locally raised militia companies, and a naval force that had been virtually wiped out in the 1779 raid. The militia were under the overall direction of Continental Army General Baron von Steuben, a prickly Prussian taskmaster who, although he was an excellent drillmaster, alienated not only his subordinates, but also had a difficult relationship with the state's governor, Thomas Jefferson. Steuben had established a training center in Chesterfield for new Continental Army recruits, and a factory in Westham for the manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition. French military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After a series of unsuccessful attempts at cooperation with the Americans leading to failed assaults on Newport, Rhode Island and Savannah, Georgia , they realized more active participation in North America was needed. However, they also needed to coordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations against Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet. As the French fleet was preparing to depart Brest in March 1781, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Comte de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap Francais present day Cap Haitien to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Due to a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte de Barras. De Barras was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap Francais. The French general, the Comte de Rochambeau was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment. Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north. The French fleet sailed from Brest on March 22. The British fleet was busy with preparations to resupply Gibraltar, and did not attempt to oppose the departure. After the French fleet sailed, the packet ship Concorde sailed for Newport, carrying the Comte de Barras, Rochambeau's orders, and credits for the six million livres. In a separate dispatch sent later, de Grasse also made two important requests. The first was that he be notified at Cap Francais of the situation in North America so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there, and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters. General Clinton never articulated a coherent vision for what the goals for British operations of the coming campaign season should be in the early months of 1781. Part of his problem lay in a difficult relationship with his naval counterpart in New York, the aging Vice Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot. Both men were stubborn, prone to temper, and had prickly personalities due to repeated clashes, their working relationship had completely broken down. In the fall of 1780 Clinton had requested that either he or Arbuthnot be recalled however, orders recalling Arbuthnot did not arrive until June 1781. Until then, according to historian George Billias, The two men could not act alone, and would not act together . Arbuthnot was replaced by Sir Thomas Graves, with whom Clinton had a somewhat better working relationship. The British presence in the south consisted of the strongly fortified ports of Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, and a string of outposts in the interior of those two states. Although the strongest outposts were relatively immune to attack from the Patriot militia that were their only formal opposition in those states, the smaller outposts, as well as supply convoys and messengers, were often the target of militia commanders like Thomas Sumter and Francis Marion. Portsmouth had most recently been occupied in October 1780 by a force under the command of Major General Alexander Leslie, but Lieutenant General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, commanding the British southern army, had ordered them to South Carolina in November. To replace General Leslie at Portsmouth, General Clinton sent 1,600 troops under General Benedict Arnold recently commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier to Virginia in late December. Part of the fleet carrying General Arnold and his troops arrived in Chesapeake Bay on December 30, 1780. Without waiting for the rest of the transports to arrive, Arnold sailed up the James River and disembarked 900 troops at Westover, Virginia, on January 4. After an overnight forced march, he raided Richmond, the state capital, the next day, encountering only minimal militia resistance. After two more days of raiding in the area, they returned to their boats, and made sail for Portsmouth. Arnold established fortifications there, and sent his men out on raiding and foraging expeditions. The local militia were called out, but they were in such small numbers that the British presence could not be disputed. This did not prevent raiding expeditions from running into opposition, as some did in skirmishing at Waters Creek in March. When news of Arnold's activities reached George Washington, he decided that a response was necessary. He wanted the French to send a naval expedition from their base in Newport, but the commanding admiral, Chevalier Destouches, refused any assistance until he received reports of serious storm damage to part of the British fleet on January 22. On February 9, Captain Arnaud de Gardeur de Tilley sailed from Newport with three ships ship of the line Eveille and frigates Surveillante and Gentile . When he arrived off Portsmouth four days later, Arnold withdrew his ships, which had shallower drafts than those of the French, up the Elizabeth River, where de Tilley could not follow. De Tilley, after determining that the local militia were completely insufficient to attack Arnold's position, returned to Newport. On the way he captured HMS Romulus, a frigate sent by the British from New York to investigate his movements. Congress authorized a detachment of Continental forces to Virginia on February 20. Washington assigned command of the expedition to the Marquis de Lafayette, who left Peekskill, New York the same day. His troops, numbering about 1,200, were three light regiments drawn from troops assigned to Continental regiments from New Jersey and New England these regiments were led by Joseph Vose, Francis Barber, and Jean Joseph Sourbader de Gimat. Lafayette's force reached Head of Elk present day Elkton, Maryland, the northern navigable limit of Chesapeake Bay on March 3. While awaiting transportation for his troops at Annapolis, Lafayette traveled south, reaching Yorktown on March 14, to assess the situation. De Tilley's expedition, and the strong encouragement of General Washington, who traveled to Newport to press the case, convinced Destouches to make a larger commitment. On March 8 he sailed with his entire fleet 7 ships of the line and several frigates, including the recently captured Romulus , carrying French troops to join with Lafayette's in Virginia. Admiral Arbuthnot, alerted to his departure, sailed on March 10 after sending Arnold a dispatch warning of the French movement. Arbuthnot, whose copper clad ships could sail faster than those of Destouches, reached Cape Henry on March 16, just ahead of the French fleet. The ensuing battle was largely indecisive, but left Arbuthnot free to enter Lynnhaven Bay and control access to Chesapeake Bay Destouches returned to Newport. Lafayette saw the British fleet, and pursuant to orders, made preparations to return his troops to the New York area. By early April he had returned to Head of Elk, where he received orders from Washington to stay in Virginia. The departure of Destouches' fleet from Newport had prompted General Clinton to send Arnold reinforcements. In the wake of Arbuthnot's sailing he sent transports carrying about 2,000 men under the command of General William Phillips to the Chesapeake. These joined Arnold at Portsmouth on March 27. Phillips, as senior commander, took over the force and resumed raiding, targeting Petersburg and Richmond. By this time, Baron von Steuben and Peter Muhlenberg, the militia commanders in Virginia, felt they had to make a stand to maintain morale despite the inferior strength of their troops. They established a defensive line in Blandford, near Petersburg Blandford is now a part of the city of Petersburg , and fought a disciplined but losing action on April 25. Von Steuben and Muhlenberg retreated before the advance of Phillips, who hoped to again raid Richmond. However, Lafayette made a series of forced marches, and reached Richmond on April 29, just hours before Phillips. To counter the British threat in the Carolinas, Washington had sent Major General Nathanael Greene, one of his best strategists, to rebuild the American army in North Carolina after the defeat at Camden. General Cornwallis, leading the British troops in the south, wanted to deal with him and gain control over the state. Greene divided his inferior force, sending part of his army under Daniel Morgan to threaten the British post at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Cornwallis sent Banastre Tarleton after Morgan, who almost wiped out Tarleton's command in the January 1781 Battle of Cowpens, and almost captured Tarleton in the process. This action was followed by what has been called the race to the Dan, in which Cornwallis gave chase to Morgan and Greene in an attempt to catch them before they reunited their forces. When Greene successfully crossed the Dan River and entered Virginia, Cornwallis, who had stripped his army of most of its baggage, gave up the pursuit. However, Greene received reinforcements and supplies, recrossed the Dan, and returned to Greensboro, North Carolina to do battle with Cornwallis. The earl won the battle, but Greene was able to withdraw with his army intact, and the British suffered enough casualties that Cornwallis was forced to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement and resupply. Greene then went on to regain control over most of South Carolina and Georgia. Cornwallis, in violation of orders but also in the absence of significant strategic direction by General Clinton, decided to take his army, now numbering just 1,400 men, into Virginia on April 25 it was the same day that Phillips and von Steuben fought at Blandford. Phillips, after Lafayette beat him to Richmond, turned back east, continuing to destroy military and economic targets in the area. On May 7, Phillips received a dispatch from Cornwallis, ordering him to Petersburg to effect a junction of their forces three days later, Phillips arrived in Petersburg. Lafayette briefly cannonaded the British position there, but did not feel strong enough to actually make an attack. On May 13, Phillips died of a fever, and Arnold retook control of the force. This caused some grumbling amongst the men, since Arnold was not particularly well respected. While waiting for Cornwallis, the forces of Arnold and Lafayette watched each other. Arnold attempted to open communications with the marquis who had orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold , but the marquis returned his letters unopened. Cornwallis arrived in Petersburg on May 19, prompting Lafayette, who commanded under 1,000 Continentals and about 2,000 militia, to retreat to Richmond. Further British reinforcements led by the Ansbacher Colonel von Voigt arrived from New York shortly after, raising the size of Cornwallis's army to more than 7,000. Cornwallis, after dispatching General Arnold back to New York, then set out to follow General Clinton's most recent orders to Phillips. These instructions were to establish a fortified base and raid rebel military and economic targets in Virginia. Cornwallis decided that he had to first deal with the threat posed by Lafayette, so he set out in pursuit of the marquis. Lafayette, clearly outnumbered, retreated rapidly toward Fredericksburg to protect an important supply depot there, while von Steuben retreated to Point of Fork present day Columbia, Virginia , where militia and Continental Army trainees had gathered with supplies pulled back before the raiding British. Cornwallis reached the Hanover County courthouse on June 1, and, rather than send his whole army after Lafayette, detached Banastre Tarleton and John Graves Simcoe on separate raiding expeditions. Tarleton, his British Legion reduced by the debacle at Cowpens, rode rapidly with a small force to Charlottesville, where he captured several members of the Virginia legislature. He almost captured Governor Jefferson as well, but had to content himself with several bottles of wine from Jefferson's estate at Monticello. Simcoe went to Point of Fork to deal with von Steuben and the supply depot. In a brief skirmish on June 5, von Steuben's forces, numbering about 1,000, suffered 30 casualties, but they had withdrawn most of the supplies across the river. Simcoe, who only had about 300 men, then exaggerated the size of his force by lighting a large number of campfires this prompted von Steuben to withdraw from Point of Fork, leaving the supplies to be destroyed by Simcoe the next day. Lafayette, in the meantime, was expecting the imminent arrival of long delayed reinforcements. Several battalions of Pennsylvania Continentals under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne had also been authorized by Congress for service in Virginia in February. However, Wayne had to deal with the aftereffects of a mutiny in January that nearly wiped out the Pennsylvania Line as a fighting force, and it was May before he had rebuilt the line and begun the march to Virginia. Even then, there was a great deal of mistrust between Wayne and his men Wayne had to keep his ammunition and bayonets under lock and key except when they were needed. Although Wayne was ready to march on May 19, the force's departure was delayed by a day because of a renewed threat of mutiny after the units were paid with devalued Continental dollars. Lafayette and Wayne's 800 men joined forces at Raccoon Ford on the Rappahannock River on June 10. A few days later, Lafayette was further reinforced by 1,000 militia under the command of William Campbell. After the successful raids of Simcoe and Tarleton, Cornwallis began to make his way east toward Richmond and Williamsburg, almost contemptuously ignoring Lafayette in his movements. Lafayette, his force grown to about 4,500, was buoyed in confidence, and began to edge closer to the earl's army. By the time Cornwallis reached Williamsburg on June 25, Lafayette was 10 miles 16 km away, at Bird's Tavern. That day, Lafayette learned that Simcoe's Queen's Rangers were at some remove from the main British force, so Lafayette sent some cavalry and light infantry to intercept them. This precipitated a skirmish at Spencer's Ordinary where each side believed the other to be within range of its main army. While Lafayette, Arnold, and Phillips maneuvered in Virginia, the allied leaders, Washington and Rochambeau, considered their options. On May 6 the Concorde arrived in Boston, and two days later Washington and Rochambeau were informed of the arrival of de Barras as well as the vital dispatches and funding. On May 23 and 24, Washington and Rochambeau held a conference at Wethersfield, Connecticut where they discussed what steps to take next. They agreed that, pursuant to his orders, Rochambeau would move his army from Newport to the Continental Army camp at White Plains, New York. They also decided to send dispatches to de Grasse outlining two possible courses of action. Washington favored the idea of attacking New York, while Rochambeau favored action in Virginia, where the British were less well established. Washington's letter to de Grasse outlined these two options Rochambeau, in a private note, informed de Grasse of his preference. Lastly, Rochambeau convinced de Barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation, rather than taking it out on expeditions to the north as he had been ordered. The Concorde sailed from Newport on June 20, carrying dispatches from Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras, as well as the pilots de Grasse had requested. The French army left Newport in June, and joined Washington's army at Dobb's Ferry, New York on July 7. From there, Washington and Rochambeau embarked on an inspection tour of the British defenses around New York while they awaited word from de Grasse. De Grasse had a somewhat successful campaign in the West Indies. His forces successfully captured Tobago in June after a minor engagement with the British fleet. Beyond that, he and British Admiral George Brydges Rodney avoided significant engagement. De Grasse arrived at Cap Francais on July 16, where the Concorde awaited him. He immediately engaged in negotiations with the Spanish. He informed them of his intent to sail north, but promised to return by November to assist in Spanish operations in exchange for critical Spanish cover while he sailed north. From them he secured the promise to protect French commerce and territories so that he could bring north his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. In addition to his fleet, he took on 3,500 troops under the command of the Marquis de St. Simon, and appealed to the Spanish in Havana for funds needed to pay Rochambeau's troops. On July 28, he sent the Concorde back to Newport, informing Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras that he expected to arrive in the Chesapeake at the end of August, and would need to leave by mid October. He sailed from Cap Francais on August 5, beginning a deliberately slow route north through a little used channel in the Bahamas. The movement of the French army to the New York area caused General Clinton a great deal of concern letters written by Washington that Clinton had intercepted suggested that the allies were planning an attack on New York. Beginning in June he wrote a series of letters to Cornwallis containing a confusing and controversial set of ruminations, suggestions, and recommendations, that only sometimes contained concrete and direct orders. Some of these letters were significantly delayed in reaching Cornwallis, complicating the exchange between the two. On June 11 and 15, apparently in reaction to the threat to New York, Clinton requested Cornwallis to fortify either Yorktown or Williamsburg, and send any troops he could spare back to New York. Cornwallis received these letters at Williamsburg on June 26. He and an engineer inspected Yorktown, which he found to be defensively inadequate. He wrote a letter to Clinton indicating that he would move to Portsmouth in order to send troops north with transports available there. On July 4 Cornwallis began moving his army toward the Jamestown ferry, to cross the broad James River and march to Portsmouth. Lafayette's scouts observed the motion, and he realized the British force would be vulnerable during the crossing. He advanced his army to the Green Spring Plantation, and, based on intelligence that only the British rear guard was left at the crossing, sent General Wayne forward to attack them on July 6. In reality, the earl had laid a clever trap. Crossing only his baggage and some troops to guard them, he sent deserters to falsely inform Lafayette of the situation. In the Battle of Green Spring, General Wayne managed to escape the trap, but with significant casualties and the loss of two field pieces. Cornwallis then crossed the river, and marched his army to Suffolk. Cornwallis again detached Tarleton on a raid into central Virginia. Tarleton's raid was based on intelligence that supplies might be intercepted that were en route to General Greene. The raid, in which Tarleton's force rode 120 miles 190 km in four days, was a failure, since supplies had already been moved. During this raid, some of Tarleton's men were supposedly in a minor skirmish with Peter Francisco, one of the American heroes of Guilford Court House. Cornwallis received another letter from General Clinton while at Suffolk, dated June 20, stating that the forces to be embarked were to be used for an attack against Philadelphia. When Cornwallis reached Portsmouth, he began embarking troops pursuant to Clinton's orders. On July 20, with some transports almost ready to sail, new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones. In the most direct terms, Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep water port, using as much of his army as he thought necessary. Clinton took this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base, firstly because sand bars obstructed the entrance to the Hudson River, damaging the hulls of the larger ships and secondly because the river often froze in winter, imprisoning vessels inside the harbour. Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development, Clinton now acceded to the Navy's request, despite Cornwallis's warning that the Chesapeake's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there will always be exposed to sudden French attack. It was to prove a fatal error of judgement by Clinton, since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement . Nevertheless, having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown, Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown. Lafayette was alerted on July 26 that Cornwallis was embarking his troops, but lacked intelligence about their eventual destination, and began maneuvering his troops to cover some possible landing points. On August 6 he learned that Cornwallis had landed at Yorktown and was fortifying it and Gloucester Point just across the York River. Admiral Rodney had been warned that de Grasse was planning to take at least part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example , he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap Francais, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France as Admiral Guichen had done the previous year. Rodney made his dispositions accordingly, balancing the likely requirements of the fleet in North America with the need to protect Britain's own trade convoys. Sixteen of his twenty one battleships, therefore, were to sail with Hood in pursuit of de Grasse to the Chesapeake before proceeding to New York. Rodney, who was ill, meanwhile took three other battleships back to England, two as merchant escorts, leaving his remaining two in dock for repairs. Hood was well satisfied with these arrangements, telling a colleague that his fleet was equal fully to defeat any designs of the enemy, let de Grasse bring or send what number of ships he might in aid of Barras. What neither Rodney or Hood knew was de Grasse's last minute decision to take his entire fleet to North America, thus ensuring a French superiority of three to two in battleship strength. Blissfully unaware of this development, Hood eventually sailed from Antigua on August 10, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his smaller ships carrying intelligence about the American pilots was captured by a privateer, thus further depriving the British in New York of valuable information. Hood himself, following the direct route, reached the Chesapeake on August 25, and found the entrance to the bay empty. He then sailed on to New York to meet with Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the New York station following Arbuthnot's departure. On August 14 General Washington learned of de Grasse's decision to sail for the Chesapeake. The next day he reluctantly abandoned the idea of assaulting New York, writing that atters having now come to a crisis and a decisive plan to be determined on, I was obliged ... to give up all idea of attacking New York... The combined Franco American army began moving south on August 19, engaging in several tactics designed to fool Clinton about their intentions. Some forces were sent on a route along the New Jersey shore, and ordered to make camp preparations as if preparing for an attack on Staten Island. The army also carried landing craft to lend verisimilitude to the idea. Washington sent orders to Lafayette to prevent Cornwallis from returning to North Carolina he did not learn that Cornwallis was entrenching at Yorktown until August 30. Two days later the army was passing through Philadelphia another mutiny was averted there when funds were procured for troops that threatened to stay until they were paid. Admiral de Barras sailed with his fleet from Newport, carrying the French siege equipment, on August 25. He sailed a route that deliberately took him away from the coast to avoid encounters with the British. De Grasse reached the Chesapeake on August 30, five days after Hood. He immediately debarked the troops from his fleet to assist Lafayette in blockading Cornwallis, and stationed some his ships to blockade the York and James Rivers. News of de Barras' sailing reached New York on August 28, where Graves, Clinton, and Hood were meeting to discuss the possibility of making an attack on the French fleet in Newport, since the French army was no longer there to defend it. Clinton had still not realized that Washington was marching south, something he did not have confirmed until September 2. When they learned of de Barras' departure they immediately concluded that de Grasse must be headed for the Chesapeake but still did not know of his strength . Graves sailed from New York on August 31 with 19 ships of the line Clinton wrote Cornwallis to warn him that Washington was coming, and that he would send 4,000 reinforcements. On September 5, the British fleet arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake to see the French fleet anchored there. De Grasse, who had men ashore, was forced to cut his cables and scramble to get his fleet out to meet the British. In the Battle of the Chesapeake, de Grasse won a narrow tactical victory. After the battle, the two fleets drifted to the southeast for several days, with the British avoiding battle and both fleets making repairs. This was apparently in part a ploy by de Grasse to ensure the British would not interfere with de Barras' arrival. A fleet was spotted off in the distance on September 9 making for the bay de Grasse followed the next day. Graves, forced to scuttle one of his ships, returned to New York for repairs. Smaller ships from the French fleet then assisted in transporting the Franco American army down the Chesapeake to Yorktown, completing the encirclement of Cornwallis. On September 6, General Clinton wrote a letter to Cornwallis, telling him to expect reinforcements. Received by Cornwallis on September 14, this letter may have been instrumental in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out, despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette. General Washington, after spending a few days at Mount Vernon for the first time in years, arrived in the camps outside Yorktown on September 17. That same day, the British military leadership in New York held a council, in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake. Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis dangling in the wind. One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help I am of the opinion that you can do me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place. Before dispatching the letter on the 17th, Cornwallis added, If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must prepare to hear the worst. Washington, Rochambeau, and de Grasse then held council aboard de Grasse's flagship Ville de Paris to finalize preparations for the siege de Grasse agreed to provide about 2,000 marines and some cannons to the effort. During the meeting, de Grasse was convinced to delay his departure originally planned for mid October until the end of October. Upon the return of the generals to Williamsburg, they heard rumors that British naval reinforcements had arrived at New York, and the French fleet might again be threatened. De Grasse wanted to pull his fleet out of the bay as a precaution, and it took the pleas of Washington and Rochambeau, delivered to de Grasse by Lafayette, to convince him to remain. The siege formally got underway on September 28. Despite a late attempt by Cornwallis to escape via Gloucester Point, the siege lines closed in on his positions and the allied cannons wrought havoc in the British camps, and on October 17 he opened negotiations to surrender. On that very day, the British fleet again sailed from New York, carrying 6,000 troops. Still outnumbered by the combined French fleets, they eventually turned back. A French naval officer, noting the British fleet's departure on October 29, wrote, They were too late. The fowl had been eaten. Cornwallis to Clinton, October 20, 1781 The negotiations for surrender were complicated by two issues. When American forces surrendered at Charleston in 1780, they were not granted customary terms of capitulation that included flying colors and the playing of an enemy tune. Washington insisted that these terms be applied to the surrender of the British army at Yorktown, his negotiators pointing out that the defenders had in both instances acted with valor. The second issue concerned the disposition of Loyalists in the British camp. This issue was finessed with the addition of a clause to the terms that allowed one British vessel, the sloop Bonetta, to be sent without any sort of inspection to carry dispatches from Cornwallis to New York Americans, suspecting that either runaway slaves or Loyalists might be aboard, were prevented from searching the vessel. When the British garrison marched out of their positions on October 19 to surrender, it was with colors cased, possibly playing the British tune The World Turned Upside Down . Cornwallis, claiming illness, did not attend the ceremony, sending his deputy General O'Hara to deliver his sword. O'Hara at first sought to deliver it to a French officer, but he was finally directed to one of Washington's officers, Benjamin Lincoln, the defeated commander at Charleston. Lincoln briefly held the proferred sword and then returned it to O'Hara. Over the following weeks, the army was marched under guard to camps in Virginia and Maryland. Cornwallis and other officers were returned to New York and allowed to return to England on parole. The ship on which Cornwallis sailed in December 1781 also carried Benedict Arnold and his family. The local militia that supported the siege were dismissed from service. Some of the American Continental forces were returned to the New York City region, where Washington continued to stand against the British presence until the end of the war others were sent south to assist in General Greene's efforts in the Carolinas. Issues of pay and condition were an ongoing problem until the war ended, but Washington fought no more battles. The French forces that came with de Grasse were reembarked, and he sailed for the West Indies, with the fleet of de Barras, in early November. After recapturing a number of British held targets there, de Grasse was preparing to join with the Spanish for an assault on Jamaica when Admiral Rodney defeated him in the April 1782 Battle of the Saintes, capturing him and his flagship. The forces of General Rochambeau wintered in Virginia, and marched back to Rhode Island the next summer. General Washington's aide, Lieutenant Tench Tilghman, was dispatched to deliver the news to Congress. Arriving in Philadelphia on October 22, he was two days behind the first notice of the surrender, which had been expressed from Baltimore ahead of him. The news electrified Congress and the populace. Church bells pealed, and the Liberty Bell was reportedly rung, actions that were repeated as the news traveled through the colonies. Some Congressmen introduced a resolution calling on General Washington to arrest and hang General Cornwallis after he debate continue'd several Day's , the resolution was voted down. The news put British occupied New York City into mourning. At first met with some skepticism, the news was finally confirmed on October 27, although the city still awaited news of Clinton's abortive relief effort. Clinton was recalled to London, and left the city in March 1782. He was replaced by General Guy Carleton, who was under orders to suspend offensive operations. When the news reached London on November 25, Lord Germain described the reaction of Lord North to the news he would have taken a ball on his breast. For he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as he paced up and down the apartment, during the few minutes, 'Oh God It is all over ' King George was reported to receive the news with calmness and dignity, although he later became depressed as the news sank in, and even considered abdication. The king's supporters in Parliament were depressed, and the opposition elated. A resolution calling for an end to the war was introduced on December 12, and failed to pass by a single vote. Lord Germain was dismissed in early 1782, and the North administration fell shortly afterward. Peace negotiations followed, and the war was formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. General Cornwallis, despite being the commander who surrendered, was not blamed for the defeat. He was well received on his return to London, and one writer echoed a common sentiment that Lord Cornwallis's army was sold. General Clinton spent the rest of his life defending his own reputation he was laughed at by the rebels, despised by the British, and cursed by the loyalists. In 1783, he published a Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in North America in which he attempted to lay the blame for the 1781 campaign failures on General Cornwallis. This was met with a public response by Cornwallis, who leveled his own criticisms at Clinton. The highly public debate included the publication of much of their correspondence. Admiral Graves also did not suffer due to his defeat by de Grasse he was eventually promoted to full admiral and given a peerage. However, many aspects of the Battle of the Chesapeake have been the subject of both contemporary and historical debate, beginning right after the battle. On 6 September, Admiral Graves issued a memorandum justifying a confusing use of signals, indicating that the signal for the line of battle ahead is out at the same time with the signal for battle, it is not to be understood that the latter signal shall be rendered ineffectual by a too strict adherence to the former. Hood, in commentary written on the reverse of his copy, observed that this eliminated any possibility of engaging an enemy who was disordered, since it would require the British line to also be disordered. Instead, he maintained, the British fleet should be as compact as possible, in order to take the critical moment of an advantage opening ... Others criticise Hood because he did not wholeheartedly aid his chief , and that a lesser officer would have been court martialled for not doing his utmost to engage the enemy. The Comte de Rochambeau dispatched two messengers to deliver the news to Paris in a move that had unusual consequences in French military politics. The Duc de Lauzun and the Comte de Deux Pontes, both of whom had distinguished themselves in the siege, were sent on separate ships to bring the news. Deux Pontes was accompanied by a favorite of the French naval minister the Marquis de Castries, the Comte de Charlus, who Lauzun had urged Rochambeau to send in his stead for political reasons. King Louis XVI and his ministers received the news warmly, but Castries and the snubbed Charlus ensured that Lauzun and Rochambeau were denied or delayed in the receipt of rewards for the success. Deux Ponts was rewarded with the Order of Saint Louis and command of a regiment. Historian John Pancake describes the later stages of the campaign as British blundering and that the allied operations proceeded with clockwork precision. Naval historian Jonathan Dull has described de Grasse's 1781 naval campaign, which encompassed, in addition to Yorktown, successful contributions to the French capture of Tobago and the Spanish siege of Pensacola, as the most perfectly executed naval campaign of the age of sail , and compared the string of French successes favorably with the British Annus Mirabilis of 1759. He also observes that a significant number of individual decisions, at times against orders or previous agreements, contributed to the success of the campaign Of de Grasse's negotiations with the Spanish that secured the use of his fleet and his order to the economic fleet to remain in the West Indies, Royal Navy Captain Thomas White, in his 1830 analysis of the 1781 campaign, wrote that f the British government had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted such a measure, ... the one would have been turned out, and the other would have been hung no wonder they succeeded and we failed. The principal points of commemoration of the events of this campaign are managed by the National Park Service in the Colonial National Historical Park. In addition to the battlefield at Yorktown, the park includes the Cape Henry Memorial, where the French naval victory by de Grasse is remembered.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown%20campaign
"The Yorktown class was a class of three steel hulled, twin screw gunboats built for the United States Navy beginning in 1887. All three ships of the class were named after cities near American Revolutionary War battles. The ships were just over 244 feet 74 m long and 36 feet 11 m abeam and displaced a little more than 1,700 long tons 1,730 t . They were equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner rigged masts. The main battery of each ship consisted of six 6 inch 152.4 mm guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller caliber guns. Ships of the class were in commission between 1889 and 1919. For most of their service, the ships were in the Pacific, patrolling the coasts of North and South America, Hawaii, and the western Pacific. Yorktown class ships saw service in many of the conflicts involving the United States from the 1890s through World War I, with all three ships seeing action during the PhilippineAmerican War. Yorktown was involved in the 1891 Baltimore Crisis in Chile, participated in the China Relief Expedition carried out in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion, and served as a convoy escort in World War I. Concord was a part of Admiral George Dewey's fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay during the SpanishAmerican War. Yorktown had the longest career in commission, being decommissioned for the final time in 1919 Concord left active service ten years before that, and Bennington was taken out of service after a boiler explosion in July 1905 at San Diego, California. The Yorktown class gunboats unofficially considered third class cruisers were the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. Contemporary news reports indicate the class was loosely based on HMS Archer, the first ship of the Royal Navy's Archer class torpedo cruisers. Yorktown was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year and Concord and Bennington were authorized in the 1888 fiscal year. The construction contract for Yorktown was awarded to the William Cramp Sons shipyard of Philadelphia and her keel was laid down in May 1887. The contract for the other pair was awarded to N. F. Palmer Co., who sublet the construction of the hulls to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding Engine Works, also of Philadelphia. Concord and Bennington were laid down in May and June 1888, respectively. The hulls of the Yorktown class were designed by the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical layout was designed by the Cramp yard for Yorktown and replicated in her sister ships. The Yorktown class ships were 244 feet 5 inches 74.50 m in length and 36 feet 11 m abeam. The steel hulls had an average draft of 14 feet 4 m , which was expected to give them the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water. At the waterline was a turtleback deck of 38 inch 9.5 mm steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces. This deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to 3 feet 0.91 m below the waterline at the sides of the ship. Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle. Above the armored deck, each ship had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them. The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval shaped to deflect shot. It was outfitted with a steam powered steering wheel, a telegraph, and speaking tubes it was protected by 2 inches 51 mm of steel armor plate. The Yorktown class ships were powered by two triple expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of 10.5 foot 3.2 m , three bladed screw propellers. The cylinders of each engine were 22, 31, and 51 inches 56, 79, and 130 cm in diameter and had a 30 inch 76 cm stroke. Each engine was rated at 3,400 indicated horsepower 2,500 kW and as a pair were designed to move the ships at 16 knots 30 km h , though all three exceeded that speed in trials Bennington reached a top speed of 17.5 knots 32.4 km h . The engines, situated in separate watertight compartments, were each fed by a pair of coal fired boilers. Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was 9 feet 6 inches 2.90 m in diameter and 17 feet 6 inches 5.33 m in length with a total grate area of 220 square inches 1,400 cm2 . The coal bunkers of each ship could carry up to 400 long tons 410 t of the fuel, and were shielded from shot and shell . At a near top speed of 16 knots, the ships could cover 2,800 nautical miles 5,200 km in 612 days at the more economical speed of 8 knots 15 km h they could cruise 12,000 nautical miles 22,000 km over 62 days. To supplement the steam power plant, the ships were built with three masts that were schooner rigged. They had a total sail area of 6,300 square feet 590 m2 . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow the Yorktown class ships to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime. The main battery of the Yorktown class consisted of six 6 inch 152 mm 30 caliber Mark 3 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of 11,000 pounds 5,000 kg . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck, two on the poop deck, and the other pair amidships on the gun deck. The two guns on the gun deck were mounted 10 feet 3.0 m above the waterline, while the other four were 18 feet 5.5 m above. The guns fired 105 pound 48 kg armor piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing 18.8 pounds 8.5 kg at 1,950 feet per second 590 m s . At an elevation of 30.2, the guns had a range of 18,000 yards 16,000 m . Each gun was shielded with steel plating 3 inches 76 mm thick. The secondary battery for Yorktown and Concord consisted of two 6 pounder 57 mm 2.24 in guns, two 3 pounder 47 mm, 1.85 in guns, and two 1 pounder 37 mm, 1.46 in guns Bennington was armed with four 6 pounders and four 1 pounders. All were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss. According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication, an armor piercing round fired from a 6 pounder gun could penetrate 2 inches 51 mm of armor at a distance of 1,000 yards 910 m . Of the three class members, Yorktown had the longest U.S. Navy career, spanning from her 1889 commissioning to her final decommissioning in 1919. Concord remained afloat the longest she was decommissioned in 1910, but served as a training ship for the Washington Naval Militia until 1914, and as a quarantine ship for the Public Health Service in Astoria, Oregon, until 1929. Bennington had the shortest Navy career she suffered a boiler explosion in July 1905 at San Diego, California, that killed over 60 crewmen. Her hulk was used as a water barge at Honolulu for the Matson Line from 1912 to 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu. Yorktown was laid down by William Cramp Sons of Philadelphia in May 1887 and launched in April 1888. After her April 1889 commissioning, Yorktown joined the Squadron of Evolution of New Navy steel hulled ships. Detached from that squadron, Yorktown, under the command of Robley D. Evans, sailed to Valparaiso, Chile, during the 1891 Baltimore Crisis and relieved Baltimore at that port. After that situation was resolved, Yorktown took part in the joint BritishAmerican sealing patrol in Alaskan waters and served as a station ship before returning to the United States in 1898. Yorktown was out of commission during the SpanishAmerican War, but took part in actions in the PhilippineAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion in 1899 and 1900, respectively, after she had been recommissioned. After three years out of commission from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktown's time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919 she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year. The contract to build Concord was awarded to N. F. Palmer Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania, in the 1888 fiscal year. Her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding Engine Works, which laid down her keel in March 1888. Concord was launched in March 1890. After her 1891 commissioning, Concord spent the next few years sailing along the East Coast of the United States, in the West Indies, and in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1893, Concord cruised on the Asiatic Station and also sailed on the sealing patrol, keeping check on fur seal hunters in Alaska. After another stint in the Far East in 1894, Concord spent a year out of commission at San Francisco from May 1896 to May 1897. After spending most of the rest of 1897 in Alaskan waters, Concord returned to the Asiatic Station in January 1898. She joined Admiral George Dewey's fleet for the 1 May 1898 Battle of Manila Bay, a decisive American victory over the Spanish Fleet in the SpanishAmerican War. After the battle, Concord supported United States Army operations in the Philippines in the PhilippineAmerican War. From 1901 to 1909, Concord alternated between Alaskan patrols, cruising the Mexican coast, and periodic trips to China, serving for a time on the Yangtze Patrol. In November 1909, Concord was decommissioned at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. For the next five years, she served as a barracks ship for the Washington Naval Militia. In 1914, the former Concord was transferred to the Public Health Service and served as a quarantine ship at Astoria, Oregon until 1929. After a brief return to Navy custody, the ship was sold in June 1929. Bennington was awarded to N. F. Palmer Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania in November 1887, but her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding Engine Works which laid down her keel in June 1888. Bennington was launched in June 1890. After her June 1891 commissioning at New York, Bennington joined the Squadron of Evolution for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands protecting American interests there. On her way to support U.S. Army operations of the PhilippineAmerican War, Bennington claimed Wake Island for the United States. After two years in the Philippines, she returned to the United States and was taken out of commission for 18 months for repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 re commissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America. On 21 July 1905 at San Diego, California, Bennington suffered a boiler explosion that killed 66 men and injured nearly everyone else on board. Shortly after the explosion, a tug beached the ship to prevent her from sinking. Eleven men were awarded the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism in the aftermath of the explosion. After Bennington was refloated, the damage was deemed too extensive to repair and the ship was decommissioned in September. The ship was sold for scrapping in 1910, but instead served as a water barge for the Matson Line at Honolulu from 1912. The former Bennington was scuttled off the coast of Oahu in 1924.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown-class%20gunboat
"Joshua Yorwerth born 28 February 1995 is a Welsh professional footballer who last played for Peterborough United. He began his career as a youth player with Cardiff City, joining the club at the age of 13. He spent time on loan with Hereford United during the club's final months before folding due to financial problems. In 2015, he signed for Ipswich Town where he made his professional debut in the EFL Cup. After spending several months on loan with Crawley Town, he joined the club on a permanent basis in 2016. He spent time on loan with Merthyr Town before establishing himself in the first team, making 91 appearances in all competitions. He joined Peterborough United in 2018 but was sacked by the club eight months later after evading an anti doping test and admitting to cocaine use. He received a four year ban from The Football Association in February 2019, the longest doping related ban ever sanctioned in English professional football. At international level, he has represented Wales at several youth levels. Yorwerth was born in Bridgend, Wales, and grew up in the nearby village of Brynmenyn. As a youngster he played youth football for local sides in Aberkenfig, where he was coached by his father Robert, and Pencoed and was a fan of Manchester United. He attended Ynysawdre Comprehensive School. He also represented Wales at youth level in rugby union. Yorwerth was a member of the Cardiff City F.C. Academy, signing scholarship forms in 2008 at the age of 13. He progressed up to the under 21 development side in 2014 but, unable to break into the first team, he sought a loan move to gain experience. Yorwerth later admitted that he struggled to find a club willing to take him on loan, commenting My agent couldnt find me anything and its quite hard to get loan moves for youngsters who havent got any experience or not played any games. He eventually joined Southern Football League side Hereford United on loan in November 2014, scoring on his debut in a 31 win over Frome Town. However the following month Hereford were forced into liquidation due to financial difficulties and they were removed from the league with their records for the season expunged. With four experienced centre backs in the squad and competition from other youngsters Ben Nugent and Adedeji Oshilaja, Yorwerth found first team chances non existent on his return to Cardiff and was not offered an extension to his contract in order to seek regular football elsewhere. He later revealed that he had suffered from a gambling addiction during his time with Cardiff. After appearing in two under 21 fixtures for the club during a trial period, Yorwerth joined fellow Championship side Ipswich Town on a two year contract, with the option of a third, in 2015. He made his professional debut for Ipswich in an EFL Cup match against Stevenage on 11 August 2015, and scored in the 55th minute. The goal equalised for Ipswich, who went on to win 21. He played in the following two rounds of the competition, featuring in a 41 victory over Doncaster Rovers and a 30 defeat to Manchester United. Yorwerth joined League Two club Crawley Town on a one month loan on 29 September 2015 and made his Football League debut against Newport County in a 30 win the same day. He made five appearances during the month and his loan spell was extended until 29 December 2015. In April 2016, Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy announced that Yorwerth would leave the club at the end of the season, with the club and player agreeing to a mutual termination of his contract a month later. On 1 June 2016, Yorwerth rejoined Crawley on a permanent basis on a one year deal. He made his first appearance of the season as a substitute in place of Jason Banton during a 11 draw with Doncaster Rovers on 13 August. Three days later, he again appeared as a late substitute and scored the only goal of the game in a victory over Exeter City. However, Yorwerth was given leave by the club to return home for personal reasons in October 2016. Having returned to Wales, Yorwerth joined local side Merthyr Town on a 28 day loan. Three days later, Yorwerth made his debut in a 20 home victory over Dorchester Town. In the following fixture, Yorwerth scored the equaliser in a 11 draw against Slough Town. On 4 November 2016, after impressing with the Welsh side, Yorwerth's loan at Merthyr Town was extended until 4 January 2017. However, days after his loan extension, Crawley decided to recall Yorwerth, after injuries to Mark Connolly and Joe McNerney. Following his return, Crawley manager Dermot Drummy credited the loan spell with an improvement in Yorwerth's form. On 30 May 2017, Yorwerth signed a new one year deal at Crawley with an option of an extra year. Under Drummy's replacement Harry Kewell, Yorwerth continued as a first team regular. However, he later admitted to clashing with the manager on several occasions over his drinking, and was even dropped on occasion after arriving at training sessions smelling of alcohol. Despite this, Yorwerth excelled for Crawley, stating his belief that he had a brilliant season. He made 43 appearances for Crawley during the 201718 season, scoring once. On 6 July 2018, Yorwerth joined League One side Peterborough United on a three year deal. Although the sum was undisclosed, it was reported to be a six figure fee. He made his debut for the club as a substitute in place of Matt Godden during a 41 victory over Rochdale in Peterborough's second game of the season. One month later, he made his first start in a 33 draw with Milton Keynes Dons in the EFL Trophy. He made one further appearance for the club in a 42 victory over Gillingham on 22 September. In September 2018, officials visited Yorwerth's home in order to carry out routine random drug tests. In the days prior to the visit he had taken cocaine and, fearing a positive test, he refused to answer the door to testers. Yorwerth feared failing the test would result in an automatic two year ban, however the offence actually carried a maximum three month sentence. His understanding of the rules related to the offence were later described as flimsy by members of The Football Association FA panel during his hearing. In December 2018, he was charged by the FA with an anti doping violation. The FA claimed Yorwerth evaded sample collection or, without compelling justification, refused or failed to submit to sample collection following notification by an anti doping official. On 26 February 2019, Yorwerth's contract was terminated after he was issued a four year ban for both evading an anti doping test and taking cocaine. Yorwerth later admitted to attending the hearing having slept for one hour, was stinking of booze and ... used cocaine the night before. The ban is believed to be the longest in the history of English professional football for an anti doping offence. He subsequently entered rehab, began counselling sessions and plans to appeal the ban on mental health grounds. Yorwerth has captained Wales at under 16 level and has also played for the under 17, under 19 and under 21 sides. He scored on his debut for Wales under 21s in a 31 victory over Bulgaria. Yorwerth has been described as an attacking defender , frequently looking to move forward with the ball out of defence, and possesses above average pace for a defender. Yorwerth himself has stated I prefer the physical side of things, no one is going to beat me on the physical side and I think my rugby background helps. Geraint Williams, who coached Yorwerth for the Wales under 21 side has described him as comfortable on the ball but added his primary concern should be concentrating on his defending.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh%20Yorwerth
"Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. To reunite baby Mario with his brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek, the player controls Yoshi, a friendly dinosaur, through 48 levels while carrying Baby Mario. As a Super Mario series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies. The game's unique appearance descends from producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto's distaste for the computer pre rendered graphics of the game's contemporary Donkey Kong Country. After four years of development, Yoshi's Island released in Japan in August 1995, and worldwide two months later. Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip. The game was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance with few changes in 2002. This version was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2011, Wii U Virtual Console in 2014, and Nintendo Switch in 2019. Yoshi's Island received instant and universal acclaim , according to IGN and review aggregator Metacritic, and sold over four million copies. Reviewers praised the art, sound, level design, and gameplay, and posited Yoshi's Island as a masterpiece and one of the best video games of all time. The game brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career. The distinct art style and Yoshi's signature characteristics established in Yoshi's Island would carry throughout a series of cameos, spin offs, and sequels, including the 1997 Yoshi's Story, 2006 Yoshi's Island DS, 2014 Yoshi's New Island, and 2019's Yoshi's Crafted World. It was the last 2D game in the Super Mario series released on a home console until New Super Mario Bros. Wii over a decade later. Yoshi's Island is a 2D side scrolling platform game. Its story begins as a Magikoopa of the Koopalings attacks a stork delivering baby brothers Mario and Luigi. They succeed in kidnapping Baby Luigi, but Baby Mario falls out of the sky and onto the back of Yoshi, the titular friendly dinosaur and player character of the single player game. While the player controlled Mario and rode Yoshi in previous series games, in Yoshi's Island, the player controls one of many Yoshis, which take turns traveling through 48 levels across six worlds to rescue Baby Luigi and reunite the brothers. In the Super Mario series platform game tradition, the player controls Yoshi with a two button run and jump control scheme. The player navigates between platforms and atop some foes en route to the end of the increasingly difficult levels. Yoshi also collects coins to earn extra lives and retains his long tongue from Super Mario World. The game centers more on puzzle solving and item collecting than other platformers, with hidden flowers and red coins to find. Levels include mines, ski jumps, and the requisite fiery dungeons . Every fourth level two in each world is a boss fight against a large version of a previous foe. In a style new to the series, the game has a coloring book aesthetic with scribbled crayon backgrounds, and Yoshi vocalizes with its every action. Expanding on his trademark tongue ability to swallow enemies, Yoshi, as the focus of the game, was given a new move set the ability to flutter jump , throw eggs, and transform. The flutter jump gives Yoshi a secondary boost when the player holds the jump button. It became his new trademark move , similar to that of Luigi in Super Mario Bros. 2. Yoshi can also pound the ground from mid air to bury objects or break through soft earth. The dinosaur's long tongue grabs enemies at a distance. Swallowed enemies can either be spat as projectiles immediately or stored for later use as an egg. The player individually aims and fires the eggs at obstacles via a new targeting system. The eggs also bounce off of surfaces in the environment. Up to six eggs can be stored this way, and will trail behind the character. Yoshi can also eat certain items for power up abilities. For instance, watermelons let Yoshi shoot seeds from his mouth like a machine gun, and fire enemies turn his mouth into a flamethrower. Other power ups transform Yoshi into vehicles including cars, drills, helicopters, and submarines. A star power up makes Baby Mario invulnerable and extra fast. While Yoshi is virtually invincible , if hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will float off his back in a bubble while a timer counts down to zero. When the timer expires, Koopas arrive to take Baby Mario and Yoshi loses a life. The player can replenish the timer by collecting small stars and power ups. However, Yoshi can also lose a life instantly if he comes into contact with obstacles such as pits, spikes, lava, and thorns. Similar to Super Mario World, the player can hold a power up in reserve, such as a 10 star which adds ten seconds to the Baby Mario timer or a magnifying glass which reveals all hidden red coins in a level . These power ups are acquired in several minigames. At the end of each level, the Yoshi relays Baby Mario to the successive Yoshi. If the player perfects all eight levels in each world by finishing with all flowers, red coins, and full 30 seconds on the timer, two hidden levels will unlock. There are three save slots on the cartridge. The Game Boy Advance version adds an exclusive bonus level for each world with 100 level completion. It also includes four player support via link cable, but only to play Mario Bros., a pack in feature also included on the other Super Mario Advance games. Shigeru Miyamoto in Next Generation, September 1995 While Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto worked on Super Mario World, he thought to make Yoshi the series protagonist. He did not like the other Yoshi games, including Yoshi's Safari and Yoshi's Cookie, and thought he could make something more authentic. When he brought Yoshi's Island to Nintendo marketing, they rejected it for having traditional, Mario style graphics rather than the vogue, pre rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country. Miyamoto recalled feeling that the marketing department wanted better hardware and more beautiful graphics instead of ... art . Around the time of his rejection, Miyamoto said that Donkey Kong Country proves that players will put up with mediocre gameplay as long as the art is good. Incensed, Miyamoto escalated the cartoonish visuals into a hand drawn, crayon style. Nintendo's marketing department accepted this revision. To achieve the style, the artists drew graphics by hand, scanned them, and approximated them pixel by pixel. Yoshi's Island was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES . According to Miyamoto, who served as a producer, Yoshi's Island was in development for four years, which let the team add lots of magic tricks . The game cartridge used an extra microchip to support the game's rotation, scaling and other sprite changing special effects. Yoshi's Island was designed to use the Super FX chip, but when Nintendo stopped supporting the chip, the game became the first to use Argonaut Games's Super FX2 microchip. The chip powered scenes including a drawbridge falling into the foreground, rotation effects like rolling and enlarged rather than reanimated enemies, and a psychedelic effect in a level when Yoshi touches a floating fungus. Yoshi's Island was released first in Japan in August 1995, and two months later in North America and Europe. At the time of release, the Super Nintendo was in its twilight as a console in anticipation of Nintendo's upcoming console to be released the following year, 1996. Yoshi's Island was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance as Yoshi's Island Super Mario Advance 3 in North America on September 23, 2002. In the game's preview at E3 2002, IGN named Yoshi's Island Best Platformer on a handheld console. The Game Boy Advance version is a direct port of the original, apart from a change to use the Yoshi voice from a subsequent series game and an extra six bonus levels. The visible area was also reduced to fit the handheld's smaller screen. The new cartridge did not need an extra microchip to support the original's special effects. The Game Boy Advance version of the game was ported to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U via Nintendo's digital Virtual Console platform. The port retains the cropped screen of the handheld version and the pack in Mario Bros. game, though the multiplayer is disabled. The 3DS version was released on December 16, 2011, as an exclusive reward for early adopters of the Nintendo 3DS. It did not receive a wider release. The Yoshi's Island port for the Wii U was released worldwide on April 24, 2014. At E3 2010, Nintendo demoed classic 2D games such as Yoshi's Island as remastered 3D games with a pop up book feel . The SNES version was included as a part of the Super NES Classic Edition microconsole in 2017. , and is also available in the SNES online app for the Nintendo Switch as part of the paid online service. Yoshi's Island received instant and universal acclaim , according to an IGN retrospective and video game review aggregator Metacritic, respectively. At the time of its 1995 release, Matt Taylor of Diehard GameFan thought Yoshi's Island could be possibly the best platform game of all time . Nintendo Power too said that the game was one of the biggest, most beautiful games ever made . Next Generation was also most impressed by the game's size and playability . Diehard GameFan's three reviewers gave the game a near perfect score. To wit, Nicholas Dean Des Barres said it was one of the handful of truly perfect games ever produced , and lamented that the magazine had given Donkey Kong Country, which he felt was a lackluster game in comparison, the extra single point for a perfect score. Casey Loe removed that one point for Baby Mario's annoying screech . Nintendo Power and Nintendo Life too found Baby Mario's crying sounds annoying. Reviewing the Super Nintendo release over a decade later, Kaes Delgrego of Nintendo Life said the crying and some easy boss battles, while both minor, were the game's only shortcomings. Delgrego credited Yoshi's Island with perfecting the genre, calling it perhaps the greatest platformer of all time . The game has sold over four million copies. Both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the art, level design, and gameplay, which became legacies of the game. Some called it charm . Delgrego of Nintendo Life would stop mid game just to watch what enemies would do. Martin Watts of the same publication called it an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game . Others praised the control scheme, technical effects, and sound design. Nintendo Life's Delgrego felt goosebumps and tingles during the ending theme, and marked the soundtrack's range from the lighthearted intro to the epic grandeur of the final boss battle . Edge praised the game's balance of challenge and accessibility. The magazine thought that the new power ups of Yoshi's Island gave its gameplay and level design great range, and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of Super Mario Bros. 3 or Yoshi's own debut in Super Mario World. Diehard GameFan's Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power up, the machine gun style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level. Nintendo Life's Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as clever for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered wastefulness. Edge thought of Yoshi's Island as a fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other . The magazine considered the game's special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay, and described the developer's handicraft as having an attention to detail that few games can match . Reviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 2002, Craig Harris of IGN wrote that Yoshi's Island was the best damn platformer ever developed . While acknowledging the game's roots in the Super Mario series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX2 sprite changing effects gave the game life and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error. IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance specific issues framerate drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a poor implementation of the dizzy special effect on the handheld release. Critics wrote that the coloring book style graphics held up well. IGN's Harris felt it was the best of the Super Mario Advance games. Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of Nintendo Life also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable . Edge felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory Super Mario World and that the sequel would inevitably ... have less impact . Multiple retrospective critics declared Yoshi's Island a masterpiece . IGN recalled it as one of the most loved SNES adventures of all time . Yoshi's Island brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Shigeru Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that game marked where Yoshi came into his own and developed many of his definitive characteristics the signature flutter jump, and ability to throw eggs and transform shape. IGN's Harris noted that the designers gave Yoshi a cute voice to accompany its move set and remains a hallmark feature of the character. Baby Mario, who debuted in the game, went on to feature in a number of sports related games. Series producer Takashi Tezuka said he consciously continued the handicraft feel of the original throughout the series, which later included yarn and similar variations. Official Nintendo Magazine called the art style a bold step ... that paid off handsomely . Delgrego of Nintendo Life wrote that the game marked a new era of art in video games that prioritized creativity over graphics technology. Delgrego continued that the game's countdown based life was a revolutionary mechanic that would later become ubiquitous in games like the Halo series. Martin Watts also of Nintendo Life considered Super Mario 64 to be a more momentous event in gaming history, but felt that Yoshi's Island was the most significant event in the Mario Bros. timeline . In a retrospective, IGN wrote that Super Nintendo console owners widely embraced the game alongside Donkey Kong Country. IGN's Jared Petty wrote that Yoshi's Island bested the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries . Levi Buchanan of IGN thought Nintendo took a risk with Yoshi's Island by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities. Christian Donlan of 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario team's staggering confidence in its development ability. He said the game was perhaps the most imaginative platformer of its time. Yoshi's Island ranked 22nd on Official Nintendo Magazine's 2009 top 100 Nintendo games as a bone fide classic , 15th on IGN's 2014 top 125 Nintendo games of all time, and second on USgamer's 2015 best Mario platformers list. Yoshi's Island led to a strong year for Yoshi as a character. IGN's Thomas added that the hand drawn style of Yoshi's Island made the computer generated Donkey Kong Country appear outdated, though both games sold well, and Rareware included a Yoshi cameo in their sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2 Diddy's Kong Quest, released that same year. Yoshi's Island graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super Nintendo tile puzzle game Tetris Attack. Following Yoshi's Island's success, Nintendo developed Yoshi's Story, a 1998 platformer for the Nintendo 64, which disappointed audiences and deflated massive ... anticipation with fetch quests and the 3D style Miyamoto eschewed in its predecessor. The Nintendo 64 game expanded on Yoshi's character voice as introduced in Yoshi's Island, but also dumbed down Yoshi's character . Nintendo created two Yoshi's Island spin off games the tilt sensor controlled Yoshi Topsy Turvy 2004, Game Boy Advance , which was developed by Artoon and critically panned, and the Nintendo developed minigame Yoshi Touch Go 2005, Nintendo DS . The 1995 original release received a direct sequel in 2006 Yoshi's Island DS, also developed by Artoon. Titled Yoshi's Island 2 until just before it shipped, the game retained the core concept of transporting baby Nintendo characters, and added babies Princess Peach, Bowser, and Donkey Kong, each with an individual special ability. Yoshi had a similar move set to Yoshi's Island and added dash and float abilities, but was more passive a character compared to the babies on his back. About seven years later, series producer Takashi Tezuka decided enough time had passed to make another direct sequel, Yoshi's New Island 2013, Nintendo 3DS . It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company, Arzest. As in the original, Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs. The game adds the ability to swallow big foes, which become big eggs that can destroy big obstacles. Yoshi's Island DS developer Arzest assisted in its development. In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die 2010 , Christian Donlan wrote that despite the streamlined Yoshi's Story and brilliant Yoshi's Touch and Go, the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon . In Eurogamer's 2015 preview of Yoshi's Woolly World, Tom Phillips wrote that it had been 20 years since the last truly great Yoshi's Island . The next console release of a Mario 2D side scroller, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, was released 14 years later.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s%20Island
"Yoshi's Island DS, later released in Japan as Yoshi Island DS DS, Yosshi Airando Di Esu , is a platforming video game developed by Artoon for the Nintendo DS. Published by Nintendo, it was released in North America and Australasia in November 2006, in Europe in December 2006, and in Japan in March 2007. It is the sequel to the 1995 SNES game, Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island. Announced at Nintendo's E3 press conference in May 2006, the game was well received by critics, scoring an average of 81 on Metacritic's aggregate. The game was originally to be titled Yoshi's Island 2, though its name was changed one month before its North American release. On April 1, 2015, the game was made available for the Wii U via the Virtual Console service shortly after a Nintendo Direct presentation. The game's story focuses on the Yoshi clan as they attempt to rescue newborn children who have been kidnapped by Kamek. Yoshi's Island DS uses the same updated graphical style as Yoshi Touch Go but retains the same core gameplay as its Super Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor but whereas the SNES game featured only Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, DS introduces Baby Peach, Baby Donkey Kong, and Baby Wario, while allowing the player to control Baby Bowser. Each baby bestows a different ability upon Yoshi. The objective of the game is to use these abilities to progress through various themed worlds. An interquel, Yoshi's New Island, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in March 2014. Yoshi's Island DS's gameplay is the same as the previous game, with some additions. Just like in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island the player guides various colored Yoshis through side scrolling stages. Yoshi can jump and hover flutter jump for a short time, eat enemies and turn them into eggs which can be used for things like hitting switches and defeating distant enemies and pound the ground to smash crates, for example . Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time. Like the original Yoshi's Island, the DS game differs from many platforming series in that Yoshi does not have a life bar when Yoshi is hit, the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him or her before a timer expires. unless Yoshi falls on something that kills him instantly, such as a lava pit or spike field What makes Yoshi's Island DS different is the addition of five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special M blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story but they do so on impact and allows Yoshi to push objects faster Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies slow down Yoshi's movement and make the timing for his flutter jumping less forgiving. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game. The Nintendo DS's two screens act as one tall screen however, in practice, this essentially just gives the player a better view of the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle only provides the benefit of being able to see more above and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini games. Each of DS's five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive. Flowers and coins, as well as stars, are scattered about the game's stages. These are totaled at the end of each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers . Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game . Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power ups of sorts like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini games and doors that would be closed otherwise. As in Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island, Baby Mario and the Yoshi clan must rescue Baby Luigi, who was snatched by Bowser's minion, Kamek, who also wants to kidnap every baby around the world. However, this time the Yoshis have the combined assistance of both Baby Peach and Baby Donkey Kong, as well as the stork, who escaped Kamek's botched capture. They later join with Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, who offer their specialized abilities so that the group may proceed. However, Baby Wario's lust for treasure leads him to abandon the group, while Baby Bowser is captured by Kamek who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles , and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser, who came from the future, because of his baby counterpart insulting him. Baby Bowser then joins the group until he notices Kamek is after him, leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey. Much later in the game, Kamek's sinister plan for kidnapping the babies around the world is revealed. He and Bowser traveled back in time in search of the star children seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe. Despite kidnapping all of the babies, they could not find a single star child. Yoshi's group later arrives at Bowser's castle and find Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, arguing over the treasure from Bowser's castle. They later join the group and as they arrive at the final room, Baby Bowser betrays them, claiming that Yoshi and the other babies wanted Bowser's treasure in his castle. Yoshi easily defeats him and Kamek arrives, along with Bowser, angered at what Yoshi did to his infant self. Despite this, the babies and Yoshis prevail in both defeating Bowser, and forcing Kamek and Bowser to retreat to their present time. Yoshi and the babies then retrieve Baby Luigi and the other babies. Bowser's castle then self destructs, but Yoshi and the other babies with the help of the other storks carrying all of the babies escape unharmed. The storks continue to bring all the babies back to their respective homes. In a post credits scene, six of the star children are revealed to be Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Baby Donkey Kong, Baby Wario and Baby Bowser. Immediately thereafter, the seventh and final star child is revealed to be a newly hatched Baby Yoshi, who is also strongly implied to be the very same Yoshi that the grown up Mario Bros. would go on to rescue and ally with in Super Mario World and subsequent Mario games. Yoshi's Island DS was announced at E3 2006 under the name Yoshi's Island 2, originally featuring only baby versions of Mario, Peach, Donkey Kong and Wario. The developer, Artoon, has made one other Yoshi game Yoshi's Universal Gravitation for the Game Boy Advance. Universal Gravitation veered away from the Nintendo design but for DS, Artoon stuck close to the original concept. The game retains the classic pastel crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are noticeable water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects are not as thick, and the backgrounds are less cluttered. However, the visuals are still tightly centered on those of its predecessor. Yoshi's Island DS received positive reviews, being given high scores by some of the most prominent video game critics. These include gaming websites IGN and GameSpot, who gave it 8 10 and 9.1 10 respectively. GameSpot's review commented that the developers have produced a sequel that seems fresh and new while remaining every bit as awesome as the original. Multimedia website IGN called it a solid recreation of the Yoshi's Island elements in a two screen high format, and GamePro in their review said that it's fun and light hearted play. Reviewers were particularly pleased with how the core gameplay elements are the same as in the previous game. GamePro hails it as having the classical 2D side scrolling action and colorful pastel artwork that brought Nintendo to prominence, while IGN although impressed with the game in general wonders whether or not the developers stuck too close to the established design in this new game, because having played the previous game ruins a lot of the surprises. Other critics regard this as the best portable Yoshi's game, with the exception of the Super Mario Advance remake of the original Yoshi's Island because, in their context, Yoshi Topsy Turvy was not there and Yoshi Touch Go was incomplete. One problem critics identified is the blind spot created by the gap between the Nintendo DS's two screens. IGN accepts that this blind spot is necessary for aiming eggs properly but still describe it as bothersome. GameSpy's reviewer calls it a pain and expresses frustration at being hit by an enemy hiding in this gap. On the whole, reviewers were pleased with the way the extra babies have been implemented, but IGN felt that Baby Wario was a last minute addition that wasn't tested properly. They call his magnet wonky, and says it misses items that are right next to him. Yoshi's Island DS was given GameSpot's Editor's Choice rating, and reached the final round for Best Nintendo DS game. The game sold more than 300,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan. As of March 31, 2008, Yoshi's Island DS has sold 2.91 million copies worldwide.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s%20Island%20DS
"Yoshi's Safari is a 1993 light gun shooter developed and published by Nintendo for its Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES . It is the only Mario franchise game to feature first person shooter gameplay and requires the SNES's Super Scope light gun. As Mario and his pet dinosaur Yoshi, the player embarks on a quest to save the kingdom of Jewelry Land from Bowser and his Koopalings, who have kidnapped its rulers and stolen 12 gems. The game features 12 levels in which the player shoots enemies like Goombas and Koopas, and collects power ups and coins. At the end of each level, the player engages in a boss fight with an enemy, a Koopaling, or Bowser. Nintendo commissioned its R D1 department to develop Yoshi's Safari in response to the waning popularity of the Super Scope. Yoshi's Safari was the first Super Scope title to use the SNES's Mode 7 graphics mode, and the future of the peripheral depended on the game's performance. Nintendo released Yoshi's Safari in Japan and North America in late 1993, and in PAL regions the following year. The game received positive reviews from video game journalists, who commended its presentationparticularly the visualsand gameplay some labelled it the best Super Scope title. However, it received criticism for its short length and low difficulty level. The game garnered little attention and failed commercially, attributed to its launch coinciding with a controversy surrounding the SNES rerelease of the popular arcade game Mortal Kombat 1992 . Most of Yoshi's Safari's additions to the Mario lore were ignored in subsequent games, and it has never been rereleased. Yoshi's Safari is a light gun shooter viewed from a first person perspective. The game features 12 levels and requires the Super Scope, a light gun peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES , to be played. The player views gameplay from the perspective of Mario riding on his pet dinosaur Yoshi's back and uses the Super Scope to shoot enemies, which include the Mario franchise's traditional Goombas, Koopas, and Cheep Cheeps. As the player fires the Super Scope, a power gauge will drop firing too rapidly will deplete it and cause long pauses between shots, making players more vulnerable to enemy attacks. The game features a multiplayer mode in which one player controls Mario using the Super Scope and another controls Yoshi using an SNES controller. In the single player mode, Yoshi is controlled automatically. After selecting a level from the overworld, the player must clear it within a time limit. In addition to enemies, the player shoots blocks with question marks to earn coins, and will earn an extra life by collecting 60. The player loses lives if enemies deplete their health bar, if they fall down a pit with less than three coins, or if they fail to complete the level within the allotted time. Losing all lives results in a game over, forcing the player to restart. The levels feature branching paths leading to different enemies and prizes, though they always end on the same path, which leads to a boss fight. Bosses include the Koopalings piloting giant mechs, bigger versions of normal enemies, and Bowser. Power ups, such as mushrooms, flowers, and stars, provide the player with extra health, firepower, and invincibility. Some power ups can only be used during boss battles. Yoshi's Safari is set in Jewelry Landa location similar to the Mushroom Kingdom and features a simple story. Series antagonist Bowser and his Koopalings kidnap Jewelry Land rulers King Fret and Prince Pine, and steal the 12 magic gems that protect the kingdom from harm, causing an earthquake that splits it in two. One of the Koopalings, Iggy, designs powerful mechs that aid Bowser's army in their invasion. Princess Peach sends Mario and Yoshi on a quest to defeat Bowser, retrieve the gems, and set the two rulers free. When the player completes the game, they will be given a cheat code that, when input at the title screen, increases the difficulty level. The game also has a leaderboard to encourage multiple playthroughs and so players can keep track of their scores. In February 1992, Nintendo released the Super Scope, a successor to its popular NES Zapper for the Nintendo Entertainment System. At the time, Nintendo was in fierce competition with Sega, a company known for its cool games and advertising, and needed an edge over this new rival. Unlike its predecessor, the Super Scope was only a moderate success and by 1993 risked fading into obscurity. Nintendo management realized the peripheral's relevance was waning and commissioned the company's famed R D1 department to develop a Super Scope game featuring Mario. The future of the Super Scope depended on the performance of this game. Yoshi's Safari was the first Super Scope game to use the SNES's Mode 7 graphics mode, which created an impression of 3D computer graphics and made the gameplay more realistic. Nintendo released Yoshi's Safari in Japan on July 14, 1993 under the title Yoshi's Road Hunting, and in North America the following September. It was released in PAL regions in 1994. The title did not garner much attention upon release. Its North American launch coincided with the rerelease of the popular arcade game Mortal Kombat 1992 , a game controversial for its violence, for the SNES and Sega's Genesis. According to IGN, Nintendo's decision to soften the blood and gore in the SNES version drew public attention away from Yoshi's Safari. While Yoshi's Safari failed commercially, which IGN attributed to its reliance on the Super Scope and the Mortal Kombat debacle, it did receive praise from video game journalists. The presentationparticularly the visualswere well received. Joypad , Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM , and Nintendo Magazine System considered the graphics and smooth scrolling among the game's highlights. Joypad wrote the animation was fluid and Nintendo Magazine System wrote the graphics suited the Mario theme, while Nintendo Power called the characters colorful and bright. The Los Angeles Times praised the game's use of Mode 7, describing the graphics as excellent and colorful. Joypad and Nintendo Magazine System both praised the music, with Joypad writing it was simple but still sounded good. Critics also commended the gameplay, with Joypad and Nintendo Magazine System calling Yoshi's Safari the best Super Scope title. Joypad praised the multiplayer mode and wrote that while the game was somewhat expensive, it was worth buying for Super Scope owners. The game had more depth than other Super Scope titles, Nintendo Magazine System wrote, because of its variety and branching level paths. Joypad and Nintendo Power respectively praised the controls as responsive and easy to use. However, the game's short length and low difficulty were primary aspects of criticism. Nintendo Magazine System's reviewers said they finished the entire game in one sitting and estimated it would provide at most a week of entertainment, while EGM wrote players may be tempted to turn your SuperScope on yourself and end it all Nintendo Magazine System and Nintendo Power suggested the game was geared toward a younger audience, with the former stating beginning players would find enjoyment but experienced ones would be left wanting more. Yoshi's Safari's failure signified that the Super Scope was commercially nonviable for Nintendo. Mario and Yoshi creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who was working on Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island 1995 at the time, disliked Yoshi's Safari and strove to make his game feel more authentic. Games starring Yoshi did not gain much popularity until Yoshi's Island, and Yoshi's Safari remains relatively obscure. The title's additions to the Mario lore, such as Jewelry Land, were ignored in subsequent games. Yoshi's Safari is notable for being the first Mario game to refer to the Princess as Peach instead of Toadstool in Western territories, although this did not stick until Super Mario 64 1996 . Nintendo would later revive old games from its back catalog through its Virtual Console service, but Yoshi's Safari has never been rereleased, and IGN noted its 25th anniversary passed in 2018 with little fanfare. The game remains the sole first person shooter in the Mario franchise. IGN lamented the obscurity of Yoshi's Safari in a 2019 retrospective and felt it deserved more recognition, writing the game was and still is a standout in the Mario franchise. The title's quirky aspects , IGN wrotesuch as its science fiction theme in contrast to previous Mario games' fantasy one , upbeat music, and use of the Super Scopepaved way for the franchise's more experimental games such as Mario Rabbids Kingdom Battle 2017 while far from perfect, Yoshi's Safari was still ahead of its time in certain regards. The writer also called it a shame the game has never been rereleased.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s%20Safari
"Yotsuba Japanese , Hepburn Yotsuba to is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma, the creator of Azumanga Daioh. It has been serialized since March 2003 in the monthly magazine Dengeki Daioh by ASCII Media Works, formerly MediaWorks, and has since been collected in fourteen tankobon volumes. It depicts the everyday adventures of a young girl named Yotsuba as she learns about the world around her, guided by her father, their neighbors, and their friends. Several characters in Yotsuba were previously featured in a one shot manga called Try Try Try The phrase Yotsuba to means Yotsuba and, a fact reflected in the chapter titles, most of which take the form Yotsuba and . The manga was licensed for English language distribution by ADV Manga, which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007. Volume six was supposed to have been released in February 2008, but was delayed indefinitely in order to focus on ADV's core business of anime. At New York Comic Con 2009, Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009, and is continuing with later volumes. Yotsuba is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai, a five year old adopted girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, odd, and quirky so much so that even her own father calls her strange. She is also initially ignorant about many things a child her age would be expected to know, among them doorbells, escalators, air conditioners, and even playground swings. This naivete is the premise of humorous stories where she learns about, and frequently misunderstands, everyday things. At the start of the series, Yotsuba and her adoptive father, Yousuke Koiwai, relocate to a new city with the help of Koiwai's best friend, an impressively tall man nicknamed Jumbo. Yotsuba makes a strong impression on the three daughters of the neighboring Ayase family, Asagi, Fuuka, and Ena. Most of her daily activities and misadventures often originate from interactions with these characters. The series has no continuing plotthe focus of the stories is Yotsuba's daily voyage of discovery. Many chapters take place on successive days for details, see List of Yotsuba chapters , so that the series follows, almost literally, the characters' daily lives. The tone can be summarized by the motto, used on chapter title pages and advertising, Today is always the most enjoyable day , Itsudemo kyo ga, ichiban tanoshii hi , or in the original translation, Enjoy Everything . In 1998, Azuma published a one shot manga and two webcomics called Try Try Try , in which Yotsuba, Yousuke Koiwai her father , Ena, Fuka, and Asagi first appeared. Although some of these characters, including Yotsuba herself, are largely the same as in Yotsuba , Fuka has a different character design, a more mischievous personality, and a different spelling of her given name in Try Try Try , it is written with the kanji , meaning wind summer in Yotsuba , it is , meaning wind scent . An anime spin off based on cat versions of Azuma's character Danbo titled Nyanbo was announced and began airing on September 26, 2016 as part of a mini anime program. This project will not adapt any of Yotsuba . The spin off is aired in Japan on NHK E and is simulcast overseas on Crunchyroll. Despite its popularity and the success of Azumanga Daioh, no plans have been announced for an anime adaptation of Yotsuba . In an entry posted on his website on 15 May 2005, Azuma said there were no plans for it to be animated he reiterated this on the 5 December 2008, claiming that the stories and style of Yotsuba are not well suited for animation. The manga is written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma, and published by ASCII Media Works in the monthly shonen aimed at teenage boys manga magazine Dengeki Daioh since the March 2003 issue, with serialization on going. Chapters have been collected in fourteen tankobon volumes. In English, Yotsuba was originally licensed by ADV Manga, who published five volumes between 2005 and 2007 before dropping the license. The North American license was picked up by Yen Press, which republished the first five volumes along with the sixth in September 2009. All thirteen volumes have since been released. In addition, the series is licensed in France by Kurokawa, in Spain by Norma Editorial, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Italy by Dynit, in Finland by Punainen jattilainen, in Korea by Daiwon C.I., in Taiwan by Kadokawa Media, in Vietnam by TVM Comics, and in Thailand by NED Comics. Each chapter of Yotsuba takes place on a specific, nearly sequential day of a common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with the date of the manga's serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. This allows the appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty two. Both monthly and daily Yotsuba calendars have been released every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, as well as other fun items for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year. The 2010 monthly calendar was released in November 2009. Two Yotsuba music CDs have been released, both purely instrumental, called image albums . The music is designed to elicit mental images of events described by the titles. Both albums are composed by Masaki Kurihara and performed by the Kuricorder Pops Orchestra, who also worked together on the Azumanga Daioh soundtrack. A Yotsuba picture book, Yotsuba Monochrome Animals, was published on 16 December 2006 .mw parser output cite.citation font style inherit .mw parser output .citation q quotes ' ' .mw parser output .citation .cs1 lock free a background url upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons thumb 6 65 Lock green.svg 9px Lock green.svg.png no repeat background position right .1em center .mw parser output .citation .cs1 lock limited a,.mw parser output .citation .cs1 lock registration a background url upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons thumb d d6 Lock gray alt 2.svg 9px Lock gray alt 2.svg.png no repeat background position right .1em center .mw parser output .citation .cs1 lock subscription a background url upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons thumb a aa Lock red alt 2.svg 9px Lock red alt 2.svg.png no repeat background position right .1em center .mw parser output .cs1 subscription,.mw parser output .cs1 registration color 555 .mw parser output .cs1 subscription span,.mw parser output .cs1 registration span border bottom 1px dotted cursor help .mw parser output .cs1 ws icon a background url upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons thumb 4 4c Wikisource logo.svg 12px Wikisource logo.svg.png no repeat background position right .1em center .mw parser output code.cs1 code color inherit background inherit border inherit padding inherit .mw parser output .cs1 hidden error display none font size 100 .mw parser output .cs1 visible error font size 100 .mw parser output .cs1 maint display none color 33aa33 margin left 0.3em .mw parser output .cs1 subscription,.mw parser output .cs1 registration,.mw parser output .cs1 format font size 95 .mw parser output .cs1 kern left,.mw parser output .cs1 kern wl left padding left 0.2em .mw parser output .cs1 kern right,.mw parser output .cs1 kern wl right padding right 0.2em ISBN 978 4 8402 3714 7 . The book has pictures of Yotsuba playing with various black and white colored animals, such as pandas. The name of each animal is given in Japanese and English, along with the scientific classification of the species. Another book called Find Yotsuba was released in 2013, which is actually a compilation of all the calendar illustrations released previously. Yotsuba is drawn not in the vertical four panel strips of Azuma's earlier series, Azumanga Daioh, but in a full page format, giving him more artistic scope. Azuma's work on Yotsuba has been noted for its clean art, detailed backgrounds, and expressive faces. Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone, slice of life storytelling, comedic writing, and eccentric yet realistic characters, especially Yotsuba herself. The Comics Reporter described the series as read like a love letter to the way kids can be at the age of 25, and a reviewer at Anime News Network compared Azuma's ability to capture the wonder of childhood to Bill Watterson's in Calvin and Hobbes. Manga The Complete Guide described it as a light, feel good manga, like an endless summer day. Nicholas Penedo of Animeland said with Yotsuba, we find ourselves plunged into the wonderful world of childhood, calling the French edition of volume eight, A beautiful manga for children and adults. BD Gest praised Azuma's skill in making distinct secondary characters, calling them immediately recognisable , and saying that they each spice up the story in their own ways. However, Azuma has been criticized for creating characters that are too clean, too perfectly functional, for overusing outrageous expressions and reactions, and for dragging out jokes too long. Yotsuba has been popular with readers as well as reviewers. For example, on Amazon.co.jp, volume six was the third best selling comic in Japan for the first half of 2007 and volume eight was the second best selling comic in Japan for 2008 volumes seven and eight both were number two on the Tohan comics chart the week they debuted. Volume eight sold more than 450,000 copies in 2008, making it one of the top 50 bestselling manga volumes on the Oricon chart for the year. The first five volumes of the English translation were each among the top 100 selling graphic novels in the United States in the month of release. Volume six of the English edition reached number 3 on the New York Times best seller list for manga, and it stayed on the list for four weeks. Volume 8 debuted at No. 2 on the manga best seller list. As of April, 27 2018, over 13.7 million copies of the manga have been printed in Japan and over 3 million outside of Japan, including the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Yotsuba received an Excellence Award for Manga at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival, where the jury citation praised the vivid characters and gentle atmosphere. In 2008 Yotsuba was nominated for the 12th Osamu Tezuka Culture Award and the Eisner Award in the Best Publication for Kids category, but did not win either, and was runner up for the first annual Manga Taisho award. In 2016, Yotsuba won the Grand Prize at the 20th Osamu Tezuka Culture Awards, sharing it with Kei Ichinoseki's Hanagami Sharaku. The English translation was listed as one of the best 20 comics of 2005 by Publishers Weekly, one of the best comics of 2006 by the staff of The Comics Journal, and one of the top graphic novels for teens in 2008 by YALSA. Volume one was named Book of the Month in the June 2005 issue of Newtype USA. There was an exhibit of Yotsuba artwork at the Gallery of Fantastic Art in Tokyo from 217 December 2006. The lead article of the May 2009 issue of the Japanese design magazine Idea was a study of Yotsuba , focusing on book design, interior layout, and how translated editions were handled.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba%26%21
"You is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the opening track of his 1975 album Extra Texture Read All About It . It was also the album's lead single, becoming a top 20 hit in America and reaching number 9 in Canada. A 45 second instrumental portion of the song, titled A Bit More of You , appears on Extra Texture also, opening side two of the original LP format. Harrison wrote You in 1970 as a song for Ronnie Spector, formerly of the Ronettes, and wife of Harrison's All Things Must Pass co producer Phil Spector. The composition reflects Harrison's admiration for 1960s American soul R B, particularly Motown. In February 1971, Ronnie Spector recorded You in London for a proposed solo album on the Beatles' Apple record label, but the recording remained unissued. Four years later, Harrison returned to this backing track while making his final album for Apple Records, in Los Angeles. The released recording features the 1971 contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Gordon and others, with further instrumentation and vocals overdubbed in 1975, notably a series of saxophone solos by Jim Horn. On release, the song was well received by the majority of music critics, who viewed it as a return to form for Harrison after his disappointing 1974 North American tour and the accompanying Dark Horse album. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone hailed it as Harrison's best work since his 197071 hit song My Sweet Lord author Ian Inglis describes You as a near perfect pop song . Capitol Records included You as one of just six Harrison solo hits, alongside compositions of his performed with the Beatles, on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison. For the first time since the debut CD release of Extra Texture in the early 1990s, You was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of Harrison's 2014 Apple Years reissues. George Harrison's admiration for American soul R B acts dated back to the early 1960s, to singles by Doris Troy, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells and others. A similar influence on him and his fellow Beatles was that era's girl group sound, as reflected in the band's choice of cover versions during 196263. In 1969, while producing Billy Preston's debut album on Apple Records, Harrison worked with Doris Troy in London and signed her to the label as a recording artist, songwriter and producer. Another of his favourite female vocalists was Ronnie Spector formerly known as Veronica Bennett, lead singer of girl group the Ronettes until 1967, and latterly married to American producer Phil Spector. After co producing Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970, following the break up of the Beatles, Spector was granted an unofficial role as head of A R for Apple Records, and had previously insisted that his wife record for the label. That year, Harrison wrote the soul inspired You as what he later termed a Ronettes sort of song , specifically for Ronnie Spector. The main lyrics I ... love ... you and You ... love ... me , in verses one and two, respectively make it one of Harrison's simplest compositions. Author Ian Inglis comments that Harrison's lyrics here recall the Beatles' use of personal pronouns in songs such as Love Me Do , From Me to You and She Loves You to effectively include the listener in the song's narrative . A deviation from these lines occurs only with the repeated bridges And when I'm holding you, what a feeling Seems so good to be true That I'm telling you all that I must be dreaming. Harrison musical biographer Simon Leng notes the importance of soul music in Harrison's solo career during the 1970s and views You as a song that most obviously demonstrates the influence of Motown on its composer. Inglis suggests that Harrison's former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney adopted part of the melody of You for his 1976 hit single with Wings, Silly Love Songs . According to Leng, Harrison taped demos of You during the lengthy recording sessions for All Things Must Pass. The sessions for a proposed Ronnie Spector solo album began at London's Abbey Road Studios on 2 February 1971, with Harrison and Phil Spector again co producing and Phil McDonald as recording engineer. Since the Ronettes' break up in early 1967, Ronnie Spector had worked only sporadically, and she later claimed to have been a virtual prisoner in her husband's 23 room Los Angeles mansion during this period. She flew in from California for the sessions, which featured three musicians who had been part of the so called blue eyed soul school of the late 1960s, via their association with Delaney Bonnie multi instrumentalist Leon Russell on piano, Jim Gordon on drums, and Carl Radle on bass. In addition to Harrison, who supplied guitar, another participant was Gary Wright, on keyboards, reprising his role on All Things Must Pass. For two days, this group of musicians taped the basic tracks for You and five other songs written or co written by Harrison, with Ronnie Spector recording guide vocals only. The sessions then broke down , according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, due to Phil's health issues , which had similarly interrupted the recording of All Things Must Pass in 1970. Despite the fact that You was tailor made for his wife, Phil Spector opted not to issue the song as her comeback single he had likewise held back recordings by the Ronettes and the Crystals, another act signed to his label, Philles Records, in the 1960s. With the solo album plan abruptly abandoned, another Harrison original from the sessions, Try Some, Buy Some , was completed and selected for release as a Ronnie Spector single on Apple. A minor hit in America only, that song's disappointing commercial reception led to the cancellation of a second single, which was to be You . Four years after the Abbey Road sessions, Harrison revisited You while completing his final album for Apple Records, the soul influenced Extra Texture Read All About It , at A M Studios in Los Angeles. His standing with music critics had recently plummeted following a North American tour with Ravi Shankar in NovemberDecember 1974 and his accompanying album, Dark Horse. These two projects had been marred by Harrison's laryngitis ravaged singing voice in addition, a number of concert reviewers had condemned Harrison for refusing to indulge the public's nostalgia for the Beatles, and for his on stage spiritual pronouncements. Looking to rehabilitate himself with critics and his audience in early 1975, Harrison had what author Robert Rodriguez describes as at least one ace in the commercial hole ... the Motown esque 'You' . Harrison recorded his own lead vocal onto the 1971 basic track, as he had done earlier with Try Some, Buy Some , for Living in the Material World 1973 . On 31 May 1975, further overdubs were carried out on You , comprising a second drum part, by Jim Keltner tenor sax solos from Jim Horn and ambient keyboards, played by David Foster. Harrison said that Horn's saxophone playing on the track was one of the nicest rock n roll sounds I've heard in years . The overdubs added to the song's radio friendly qualities, particularly through the use of ARP String Synthesizer, but Madinger and Easter note that Keltner's drum part, which is higher in the mix than Gordon's and was played in half time, produces an effect whereby the song's tempo appears to be slower than on the 1971 recording. With a significant amount of post production work having been carried out in Los Angeles, Spector did not receive a co producer's credit for You as he had for Harrison's version of Try Some, Buy Some . In September 1975 Harrison told BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini that it was such a good backing track originally, yet he had forgotten about its existence until coming across the tape years later. In a 1987 interview, Harrison acknowledged the difficulty he had in singing the song in so high a key it was recorded in Ronnie's register, he explains in his 1980 autobiography, a bit high for me. Although Ronnie Spector's name did not appear in the album credits, snippets of her 1971 guide vocal remain on Harrison's released recording. Spector's voice can be heard intermittently from the two minute mark onwards, with her signature woh oh oh oh oh s audible during the song's playout. An upbeat pop song in a similar vein to Harrison's 1971 hit What Is Life , You was the most obvious choice for a single off Extra Texture. It was released in advance of the album, backed by World of Stone , on 12 September 1975 in Britain as Apple R 6007 and three days later in the United States as Apple 1884 . The picture sleeve in Britain featured a photo of a smiling Harrison taken on stage by 1974 tour photographer Henry Grossman the US picture sleeve incorporated Roy Kohara's humorous design for the album, showing blue lettering on a vivid orange background. In another example of the upbeat mood that was otherwise lacking in the musical content of Extra Texture, the single's face labels showed the familiar Apple Records logo as an apple core, a pun on the demise of the company. In the UK, where Harrison had undertaken promotional activities for the first time for Extra Texture, You was Radio 1's Record of the Week, guaranteeing it substantial airplay. The song peaked no higher than Harrison's previous hit there, Ding Dong, Ding Dong , at number 38, however. As with his Dark Horse singles, You performed better in America, where it held the number 20 position for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. On the US charts compiled by Cash Box and Record World, the single peaked at number 19 and number 39, respectively. The song served as both the opener for Extra Texture as well as, in the form of a 45 second instrumental portion titled A Bit More of You , the first track on side two of the original LP. Harrison biographer Dale Allison dismisses this reprise with the words It's filler , while Leng suggests its purpose was to fashion a soul mood for the song that follows, the pop soul ballad Can't Stop Thinking About You . The full version of You appears on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as one of only six selections from Harrison's solo career up to the end of 1975. Having last been remastered for the 199192 CD release of Extra Texture, the song was remastered for inclusion on Harrison's Apple Years 196875 reissues, released in September 2014. After the so called Dark Hoarse debacle in 1974, and with his singing voice now healed, music critics viewed You as a return to form for Harrison. The tone of the song suggested that, in the words of Robert Rodriguez, the irritable, gravel voiced mystic on tour the previous year had been but an illusion an impression that was supported by the lightheartedness evident in the parent album's artwork and Harrison's self deprecating Ohnothimagen producer's moniker. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone wrote of the song 'You,' the single which preceded Extra Texture ... is not only the best thing he has done since 1971's 'My Sweet Lord,' but also promised some of the prestige and credibility he lost with last year's sourvoiced album Dark Horse and fizzled tour. In the NME, Neil Spencer opined 'You' seems at least to proclaim a return to energy. It has the kind of semi Spector production that was spread all over All Things Must Pass. It bounds along OK, Harrison's double tracked vocals gasp convincingly, and it deserves to be the hit that it will be. Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman highlighted Harrison's vocal and the musical contributions from Horn and Russell, and said It's a dead cert disco smash, his finest single since 'My Sweet Lord'. Coleman added that the lyrics were deceptively simple since, as with Harrison's 1969 composition Something , they say a lot by saying a little. Writing later in the 1970s, however, in their book The Beatles An Illustrated Record, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler dismissed the song with the words Doleful, lacklustre, would be singalongs which quite fail to arouse. In his review of Harrison's 1987 album Cloud Nine, for Creem magazine, Bill Holdship included the track among the scattered brilliant moments of Harrison's career post All Things Must Pass, saying 'You' from the Extra Texture LP sounds like punk depends on your definition pop as Phil Spector might've done it, and remains a killer to this day. And when I saw Harrison perform in 1974, he put on a far better show than the one I would later see Wings do. Writing in the posthumous Rolling Stone Press tribute, Harrison, in 2002, Mikal Gilmore similarly identified You as a highlight of the artist's work in the mid to late 1970s. In the same publication, Greg Kot deemed it to be a terrific single , adding Its roaring Wall of Sound arrangement suits Harrison well, right down to its closing quote of the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'. In a January 2002 review of Harrison's solo releases, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the song as magnificent . AllMusic's Lindsay Planer admires it as a propulsive and rocking love song ... backed by one of Harrison's most liberated and driving melodies Planer also notes the nonstop powerhouse instrumental track , driven by Gordon and Keltner's double barreled percussive assault . Richard Ginell, also writing for AllMusic, calls the song an instantly winning single and album opener, and rates it among the best tracks of Harrison's solo career. Among reviewers of Harrison's 2014 Apple Years reissues, New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid describes You as a remarkably upbeat rocker , while Walter Tunis of the Lexington Herald Leader considers Extra Texture to be a delight , from the opening, brightly orchestrated pop of You through to the closing track, His Name Is Legs . Conversely, Paul Trynka of Classic Rock says that the song sounds dull today, with its dated sessioneer funk , whereas it's the confessional songs that have worn well. Simon Leng views it as a great pop record , adding 'You' has the same surging spirit as Dancing in the Street and Heat Wave and, as the lyrics are full of boy meets girl triteness, the groove is what carries it. Ian Inglis identifies the song's strengths as its lyrical simplicity, a soaring, galloping melody ... encapsulates the joy of reciprocated love and the liberation of rock 'n' roll at its most exuberant , and the quality of the musicianship on the recording, particularly Jim Horn's contribution. Inglis concludes Even the slight unease has in striving to maintain some of the higher notes cannot detract from what is, quite simply, a near perfect pop song. Two years after Harrison's death from cancer in November 2001, American singer songwriter Lisa Mychols covered You for the multi artist compilation He Was Fab A Loving Tribute to George Harrison a reading that Lindsay Planer describes as affective and a highlight of the album. At the New York Celebrates George Harrison Concert on 26 February 2011, in honour of what would have been Harrison's 68th birthday, New York band the 253 Boys performed You in a medley with his Cloud Nine track This Is Love . denotes MayJune 1975 overdubs",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29
"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1967 in Woodstock, New York, during the self imposed exile from public appearances that followed his July 29, 1966 motorcycle accident. A recording of Dylan performing the song in September 1971 was released on the Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II album in November of that year, marking the first official release of the song by its author. An earlier 1967 recording of the song, performed by Dylan and the Band, was issued in 1975 on the album The Basement Tapes. The Byrds also recorded a version of the song in 1968 and issued it as a single. The Byrds' version is notable for being the first commercial release of the song, predating Dylan's first release by three years. A later cover by Byrds members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman reached the top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts in 1989. The song has also been covered by many other artists, including Joan Baez, Unit 4 2, Earl Scruggs, Old Crow Medicine Show, Phish, Counting Crows, the Dandy Warhols, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Loudon Wainwright III, and Glen Hansard with Marketa Irglova. Starting in June 1967 and ending in October 1967, Bob Dylan's writing and recording sessions with the Band then known as the Hawks in Woodstock, New York, were the source of many new songs that were circulated as demos by Dylan's publisher for fellow artists to record. You Ain't Goin' Nowhere was written and recorded during this period and features lyrics that allude to the singer waiting for his bride to arrive and possibly, a final premarital fling. The original version found on 1975's The Basement Tapes album was recorded with the Band minus Levon Helm who had temporarily left the group at this point in the basement of their house in West Saugerties, New York, called Big Pink . A first take recorded during the Basement Tapes sessions includes improvised nonsense lyrics such as Just pick up that oil cloth, cram it in the corn I don't care if your name is Michael You're gonna need some boards Get your lunch, you foreign bib . This alternate take was released in 2014 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 11 The Basement Tapes Complete. On September 24, 1971, Dylan re recorded three songs from the Basement Tapes sessions for inclusion on his Greatest Hits Vol. II album You Ain't Goin' Nowhere , I Shall Be Released , and Down in the Flood with Happy Traum playing bass, banjo, and electric guitar, as well as providing vocal harmony. Traum notes that they were very popular songs ... that wanted to put his own stamp on. The lyrics of this performance of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere differed significantly from both the Basement Tapes versions, and also played upon a mistaken lyric in the Byrds' cover version of three years earlier see below . The 1971 version was later released on the compilations The Essential Bob Dylan 2000 and Dylan 2007 , although the latter album's liner notes erroneously state that it is the 1967 version. The Byrds' recording of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere was released as a single on April 2, 1968, some three years prior to any commercial release of the song by Dylan. It was the lead single from the Byrds' 1968 country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, and reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The Byrds' version of the song features musical contributions from session musician Lloyd Green on pedal steel guitar. Although it is not as famous as their cover version of Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man , the Byrds' recording of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere is often considered by critics to be the band's best Dylan cover. The song was selected as a suitable cover by the Byrds after their record label, Columbia Records which was also Dylan's record label , sent them some demos from Dylan's Woodstock sessions. Included among these demos were the songs You Ain't Goin' Nowhere and Nothing Was Delivered , both of which were recorded by the Byrds in March 1968, during the Nashville recording sessions for Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Author Johnny Rogan has commented that despite the change in musical style that the country influenced Sweetheart of the Rodeo album represented for the band, the inclusion of two Dylan covers on the album forged a link with their previous folk rock incarnation, when Dylan's material had been a mainstay of their repertoire. The Byrds' recording of the song caused a minor controversy between the band and its author. Dylan's original demo of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere contained the lyric Pick up your money, pack up your tent , which was mistakenly altered in the Byrds' version, by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn, to Pack up your money, pick up your tent . Dylan expressed mock annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 recording of the song, singing Pack up your money, put up your tent McGuinn You ain't goin' nowhere. McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new recording of the song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will the Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two album, adding the word Dylan after the same Pack up your money, pick up your tent lyric. McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 recording of the song, which also featured the Byrds' former bass player Chris Hillman, was released as a single and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989, as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by RPM. In spite of the involvement of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone. After its appearance on Sweetheart of the Rodeo, You Ain't Goin' Nowhere would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The Byrds re recorded You Ain't Goin' Nowhere in 1971 with Earl Scruggs, as part of the Earl Scruggs, His Family and Friends television special, and this version was included on the program's accompanying soundtrack album. The song was also performed live by a reformed line up of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989. McGuinn continues to perform the song in his solo concerts and consequently it appears on his 2007 album, Live from Spain. In addition to its appearance on the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album, the Byrds' original recording of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere also appears on several of the band's compilations, including The Best of The Byrds Greatest Hits, Volume II, History of The Byrds, The Byrds Play Dylan, The Original Singles 19671969, Volume 2, The Byrds, and There Is a Season. Live performances of the song are included on the expanded edition of the band's Untitled album and on Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971. The British beat group Unit 4 2 released a recording of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere as a single in 1968, but it suffered poor sales as a result of the version released by the Byrds and consequently it did not chart. Joan Baez included a gender switched version of the song, in which she sings Tomorrow's the day my man's gonna come , on her 1968 album of Dylan covers, Any Day Now. Australian band the Flying Circus included this song on their self titled debut album released in August 1969. Roots rock quartet the Rave Ups covered the song on their 1985 album, Town and Country. Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Rosanne Cash also performed the song at Madison Square Garden in 1992, for eventual release on the Bob Dylan tribute album The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Phish covered the song during their July 30, 2003 concert at the Tweeter Center at the Waterfront in Camden, New Jersey. This is the only time that Phish has performed the song, coming in the show before their IT music festival in Maine particular emphasis was put on the lyric We'll climb that hill, no matter how steep...when we get up to it. The Crust Brothers covered You Ain't Goin' Nowhere on their 1998 live album, Marquee Mark and Counting Crows recorded the song as a bonus track on their Hard Candy album in 2002 as well as performing it live with Augustana. The song also features on the Fairport Convention live album Cropredy 2002. Maria Muldaur recorded the song, with slightly altered lyrics, on her 2006 Heart of Mine Maria Muldaur Sings Love Songs of Bob Dylan album, and Marty Raybon, former vocalist of Shenandoah, also covered the song on his 2006 album, When the Sand Runs Out. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova recorded the song for the soundtrack album to Todd Haynes' 2007 Dylan biopic I'm Not There, using the lyrics from Dylan's 1971 version, including the reference to Roger McGuinn. The Dandy Warhols covered You Ain't Goin' Nowhere on the 2009 digital download edition of their album The Dandy Warhols Are Sound and as part of their September 1, 2011 Daytrotter session. Actor Oscar Isaac with Kate Mara and Chad Fischer performed a version of the song in the 2011 film 10 Years, which also appeared on the film's soundtrack. In 2012, Brett Dennen released a version of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere on the Chimes of Freedom Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International album. Garth Brooks covered the song for his 2013 Blame It All on My Roots Five Decades of Influences compilation. Willie Nile covered this song on his 2017 album Positively Bob. Loudon Wainwright III covered the song on his 2018 album Years in the Making. Wainwright III has mentioned Dylan as a big influence and refers to this influence in his song Talking New Bob Dylan from his album History.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Ain%27t%20Goin%27%20Nowhere
"You and I stylized as You and I is a song written and recorded by American singer Lady Gaga, taken from her second studio album, Born This Way 2011 . She also co produced it with Robert John Mutt Lange. The track samples Queen's We Will Rock You 1977 and features electric guitar by Queen's Brian May. Gaga debuted You and I in June 2010 during her performance at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet, and positive response encouraged her to include the song on her setlist for The Monster Ball Tour. She later performed the song on Today to a record crowd in July 2010, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in May 2011. On August 23, 2011, Interscope released the song as the fourth single from the album. You and I is a slow tempo song featuring instrumentation from electric guitars and piano, with Gaga and Lange providing background vocals. The song received critical acclaim, with reviewers listing it as one of the highlights from Born This Way. After the release of the parent album, You and I charted in Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, due to digital downloads from the parent album. Season ten American Idol contestant Haley Reinhart performed You and I in May 2011 before its release, earning positive reviews. Her studio recording was released to the iTunes Store as a single, and appeared on the compilation album, American Idol Top 5 Season 10. You and I was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, which was held on February 12, 2012. The accompanying music video for You and I was also met with a positive response. It was shot by Gaga's long time collaborator Laurieann Gibson in Springfield, Nebraska, and it was released on August 16, 2011. It features Yuyi, Gaga's mermaid alter ego, and Jo Calderone, Gaga's male alter ego, who also appears on the single's cover. Gaga later performed the song dressed as Jo Calderone at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The song has subsequently been performed on the singer's concert tours and residencies. You and I , written by Lady Gaga and produced by Gaga and Robert John Mutt Lange, was one of the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played You and I at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a rock and roll tune and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said that it is very dear to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that 'You and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met , allegedly Luc Carl, her ex boyfriend. Gaga announced You and I as the fourth single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, was accompanied by the line You will never find what you are looking for in love, if you don't love yourself. It features two black and white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London for a series of photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke. A writer for Australia's The Daily Telegraph described the images as having a moody and scruffy look, and felt that Gaga had become bored with being an outrageous woman and has decided to switch gender instead. Rap Up's David Jones commented that Gaga's Calderone character appearing on the cover looked similar to musician Bob Dylan. Although Steve Pond of Reuters did not like the song, he stated about the artwork Lady Gaga loves herself even when she's dressed as a guy. You and I has rock and country music influences, and features British rock band Queen's guitarist Brian May. It was recorded by Tom Ware and Horace Ward at the Warehouse Productions Studio in Omaha, Nebraska, and Allertown Hill in the United Kingdom, respectively. Along with May, Justin Shirley Smith also played guitars Gene Grimaldi mastered the track. Olle Romo did additional recording and programming. Gaga teased that someone legendary would be producing the track before production credits were announced in April 2011. Gaga, a Queen fan even taking her stage name from the Queen song Radio Ga Ga , admitted to to the floor crying and laughing when she found out that May agreed to the collaboration. Lange asked Gaga to record a rough lead vocal for the track while she was touring. Gaga later recalled I had about 30 cigarettes and a couple of glasses of Jameson and just put on a click track and sang my face off, thinking we'd redo the vocals. However, Lange was satisfied with her recording and used it on the track. Ware recalled that the song was recorded the night after Gaga's March 17, 2011, concert for The Monster Ball Tour. She welcomed his opinions and encouraged his input which he said helped make the four hour session the best working experience he has had with a celebrity. She was flattering toward the studio and Omaha, too, for that matter. She is a bright young lady with remarkable music instincts who charts her own path, he added. According to the sheet music published by Sony ATV Music Publishing, You and I is set in common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an AGA chord progression, which changes to ABm AD ABm during the chorus, and back to the former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics It's been a long time since I came around It's been a long time, but I'm back in town And this time, I'm not leaving without you describe a whiskey breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel house piano solo. Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time... Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from We Will Rock You , thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls. Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an umlaut toting digital country power ballad with two Bruce Springsteen references born to run and Nebraska. You and I received acclaim from music critics. After hearing the White Tie and Tiara Ball performance, Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt complimented the song for its torchy, slow burn cabaret quality and for lacking Auto Tune, fancy production, or performance gimmicks. McCormick, noting the differences between Gaga's live and studio versions of the song, described the studio version as bigger, bolder and less quirkily emotive, a custom built radio rock ballad to induce hand claps in packed stadiums. This is not music for the underground it is cheesy, high gloss, pop rock for the mainstream middle, a kind of instant Eighties retro classic to seduce middle aged rockers possibly the last demographic to remain sceptical about her appeal. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the song a confessional power ballad with a torrid, Sturm und Drang vocal turn . In his review for The Guardian, Tim Jonze said the song aims for a 'Hey Jude' style singalong but owing to its determination to have someone playing kitchen sink in the background ends up as bloated as Oasis' 'All Around the World'. Dan Aquilante of The New York Post wrote a less than favorable review of Born This Way but complimented You and I and the uniquely earthy quality that Lange brought to the album. Kitty Empire said the song is Gaga's unlikely heartland moment a bid, perhaps, to locate herself as an all American balladeer as well as an art disco avatar with tent pegs under her skin , referring to the implants featured in the music video for the song Born This Way. The Dartmouth's Kate Sullivan wrote that You and I may be Gaga's most honest song to date. Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter wondered whether pop radio would play the song, considering Gaga's popularity. Halperin felt that the track emoted a sense of grandness that listeners don't always get with Gaga's RedOne produced heavily synthetic sounds. Conversely, she felt that the live piano and background vocals by Gaga and Lange added an undeniably lush quality, while the lyrics drives the song home and potentially into hit territory. Kerri Mason of Billboard felt that the country ballad made no contextual sense. Nekesa Mumbi Moody, while reviewing Born This Way for Florida Today, compared the song to Speechless , a similar tempo song included on The Fame Monster 2009 . Robert Copsey, a writer for the website Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars calling it a torchy, retro classic, all American power ballad custom built for the masses and one we suspect Stefani would be proud to call her own. Amy Sciarretto of Artistdirect concluded that the song was a bit bluesier than anything you'd expect from the dance floor icon. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a highlight on Born This Way saying that Gaga shows her vulnerability in it. You and I was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, which was held on February 12, 2012.

Gaga talking about her love for Nebraska, and the shooting of the video. You and I 's music video was filmed in Springfield, Nebraska in July 2011, and was directed by Lady Gaga's choreographer Laurieann Gibson. In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding a little bit and there's grass stuck in my shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture, she continued. I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back. She announced that the video would be the 1,000th tweet on her Twitter account. Gaga confirmed to MTV News that the video would premiere on August 18, 2011 on MTV. However, two days before it was to air, parts of the clip leaked on the Internet, prompting Gaga to post three tweets which, together, read FUCK THURS DAY . The messages were followed immediately by her 1,000th Twitter message You must love all every part of me, as must I, for this complex incomprehensible force to be true, including a link to the full music video, uploaded to Gaga's YouTube channel two days earlier than its scheduled premiere. The video features Gaga's two alter egos Jo Calderone, Gaga's male ego, and Yuyi, a mermaid she had hinted would appear in the video in July 2011. Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga explained some of the its scenes and her inspiration The video is quite complex in the way that the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is. Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of you that you can make it work, she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck. According to her, they represented the destruction of her youth, experiences she had shared in earlier interviews. Explaining her decision to include them, Gaga said That's how I wanted to open the video, because I think it really sets up the rest of the story. It allows you to imagine you yourself are not just one person you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video it's meant to be a profuse number of the question. The music video begins with Gaga, dressed in black clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and seemingly bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano in the middle of a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert. During the second verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, seemingly tortures Gaga, who is wearing a yellow dress with glasses made of barbwire, as another version of the singer, with teal colored hair, performs a dance routine with her backup dancers in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yuyi the Mermaid, with gills on her face and neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings You and I in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yuyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yuyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yuyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black. Following its premature release on the Web, the music video for You and I met with positive reviews. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone felt the video was an improvement over her earlier videos, Judas and The Edge of Glory, saying, the best moments of the video put a distinctly Gaga ish spin on the iconography of Americana and traditional love stories. Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote the video has torture contraptions, mermaid sex, a wedding, bondage in a barn, an ice cream truck, and to top it all off, 'Children of the Corn' and religious overtones thrown in for good measure, and thought the video setting was the strangest representation of Nebraska. Leah Collins of Dose felt the video was a great opportunity for the singer to finally find out what it's like to make out with herself. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted of the scene in which Gaga plays a piano in a cornfield beside her male alter ego She's just Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, playing a piano in the middle of a corn fieldwith a little making out on the side, of course. Gil Kaufman of MTV News believed that Gaga was not joking when she talked about the video being about the torture of being away from the one you love. And, man, based on the bruising final product, she wasn't kidding, Kaufman concluded. Jocelyn Vena of MTV found influences of Gaga's past videos in the various avatars she plays You and I. She explained that when stands at a crossroads in a big hat, the image is reminiscent of 'Telephone' Gaga. When she sits nearly makeup free at her piano in the cornfields, there are touches of the teary eyed makeup less Gaga from the 'Bad Romance' video. Flashes of her wedding may remind fans of the wedding dress she wore in the 'Judas' clip. Robot Gaga's facial structures recall some of the steampunk looks of her 'Alejandro' video. Those are only a few of the nods to past personae from her own videography. Devin Brown of CBS News felt that Gaga had finally returned to form with the video. After some visually pleasing but generally lackluster videos, she has finally come out with something to write home about. 'You and I' is arguably the best song on her sophomore release, Born This Way, and now has a video to match. A Slant Magazine writer commented that the publication had a mixed reaction to the video, saying that it is essentially a collection of disconnected images we couldn't make heads or tails of. On September 1, 2011, Gaga announced on her Twitter account that she had shot five fashion films related to the song's music video with Dutch photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. The characters for each of the videos are Jo Calderone Gaga's alter ego , Yuyi a mermaid , Nymph, Bride, and finally Barn Hooker and Mother. After the tweet, Gaga released the first video, titled Haus of U featuring Nymph . The two minute black and white video featured Gaga with minimal make up, wearing a short dress, performing ballet choreography. As wind blows around her, the singer looks intently toward the camera, with the parting shot in color. The second video featured her as the bride from the opening sequence of the music video. The fashion film portrayed her in the same costume, gradually removing it and her wig. At the end, she is topless with her hand covering her breasts. Interspersed between are scenes portraying people dressed like Gaga, and appearances by Taylor Kinney, who was in the music video, and the singer's stylist Nicola Formichetti. The third fashion film portrayed the singer as the mermaid Yuyi. She sits in a director's chair, flopping her tail. It also shows two crew members carrying Yuyi toward the barn, where the music video was filmed. Formichetti also makes a cameo in this video. After the first performance of You and I at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball, Gaga performed the song live on the television program Today on July 9, 2010, before an estimated crowd of 18,00020,000 people, the largest ever to pack Rockefeller Plaza. It was next performed on the July 31, 2010, Phoenix stop of the Monster Ball Tour, where Gaga protested Arizona's immigration law SB 1070which mandates that state police officers question any person they suspect to be an illegal immigrant and imprison any aliens not carrying one of four allowed forms of proper identification and dedicated her performance of You and I to a boy whose family had been affected by the law. Gaga performed the album version of the track on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 5, 2011, using a piano constructed from a wire high heel structure while sitting on a high stool. The less organic version for the final Harpo Hookups episode featured an electric guitar and modified lyrics to include Oprah's name. The song was on the set list of the HBO television special, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour At Madison Square Garden, which aired originally on May 7, 2011, in the United States. Gaga's performance of You and I from the HBO special aired on American Idol, the night after she mentored the four remaining contestants, and the week following Haley Reinhart's performance of the song. She performed a jazz version of You and I at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria on May 18, 2011. The third performance of the album version of the song was on the Paul O'Grady Live show in London, on June 17, 2011. Wearing a dress by the late Gianni Versace, Gaga perched atop a New York City inspired fire escape, where she sang the song. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the show's recording, and said that it was a real treat to hear Gaga sing the song. In August 2011, Gaga performed You and I on the American TV talk show program The View. On August 28, 2011, Gaga attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards dressed as Jo Calderone. As Calderone, she opened the show with a four minute monologue, explaining his broken relationship with Gaga. Following the monologue, joined on stage by Brian May, she performed You and I . On October 6, 2011, she filmed a pre recorded interview and performance for the single on The Jonathan Ross Show. Later, on October 16, 2011, she performed the song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for the Clinton Foundation. On the ABC special, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, the singer performed the song backed by a piano and trumpet arrangement . On November 30, during the CBS special titled The Grammy Nominations Concert Live Countdown to Music's Biggest Nightwhere the nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards were revealedGaga performed You and I along with Jennifer Nettles of the country band Sugarland while Kristian Bush played the guitar. During the performance, she changed the lyrics to fit the occasion With your high cowboy boots on. Oh Sugarland, it's been six whole years. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, she performed a husky, musky version of You and I . She performed the song on the Born This Way Ball tour 20122013 by playing it on the piano before running around the stage. Like previous concert tours, the piano, fused to a motorcycle, was an elaborate prop that tied into the theme of her show, in keeping with the hair metal theme of Born This Way. The song was also part of the setlist of Gaga's 2014 residency show at Roseland Ballroom. In July 2016, Gaga performed You and I at the Camden Rising concert at the BB T Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey, which was part of the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The performance of the song was later included in her documentary film, Gaga Five Foot Two 2017 . In 2017, Gaga performed the song during both of her shows at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and included it in her set at the Deep From the Heart The One America Appeal benefit concert in Texas, where she joined former US presidents and other performers in raising money to hurricane victims. During the latter, she changed up the lyrics to address each president with the song. Gaga has also performed the song on her 20182019 Las Vegas residency show, Enigma. Prior to the release of Born This Way, season ten American Idol contestant Haley Reinhart sang You and I as one of two performances for the Songs from Now and Then episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart sounded amazing by hitting some really high notes . Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an old fashioned dance hall groove, kind of like a mid '70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel style rocker, and she takes it to the house. Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judgesRandy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tylerreacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of You and I was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, feeling that if she could get another 10 songs this good when it comes time to cut the record, then all my initial misgivings about this girl will vanish into thin air. British singer Amelia Lily covered the song in November 2011 during her time on UK talent show The X Factor. On November 15, 2011, comedy drama, musical TV series Glee featured a mash up of Gaga's You and I and Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle's You and I , performed by Matthew Morrison and Idina Menzel as their respective characters Will Schuester and Shelby Corcoran in the episode Mash Off . The mash up sold 23,000 digital downloads, and debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 69, in the issue dated December 3, 2011.

"You Are Not Alone is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album HIStory Past, Present and Future, Book I 1995 . It was released on August 15, 1995 as the second single from the album. The song was re released in 2006, as part of Jackson's Visionary The Video Singles collection box set, where it re entered at number 30 in the UK Singles Chart in 2006. The R B ballad was written by American R B singer R. Kelly for Michael Jackson in response to difficult times in his own personal life. Kelly sent a bare demo tape to Jackson, who liked the song and decided to produce it with him in Chicago. Jackson's interest in the song was also linked to recent events in his personal life. The song's corresponding music video, which featured Jackson and his then wife Lisa Marie Presley, featured scenes of semi nudity. You Are Not Alone received a generally positive critical reception and was the recipient of Grammy and American Music Award nominations. The song was a commercial success. It holds a Guinness World Record as the first song in the 37 year history of the Billboard Hot 100 to debut at number one, and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The track also topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. You Are Not Alone was Michael Jackson's thirteenth and last number one single in the United States during his lifetime. To posthumously pay tribute to Jackson who passed in June 2009, Kelly included a version of the song on his studio album Love Letter 2010 . In 2011, a clip of the song was remixed with the song I Just Can't Stop Loving You the final Immortal Version was released on the Immortal album. You Are Not Alone is an R B ballad about love and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and produced by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted to be able to work with his idol, explaining I was psyched ... I feel I could have done his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world ... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson ... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true. Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung You Are Not Alone mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, I think I am him. I become him. I want him to feel that as well. Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track. Jackson explained that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production should be a collaborative effort among the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song is written in the key of B major. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's slowest songs. In 2007, a Belgian court ruled that Kelly had plagiarized the 1993 composition If We Can Start All Over by Eddy and Danny Van Passel. The court transferred rights track to the Van Passels, though the judgment is only recognized in Belgium. 'You Are Not Alone' received positive views from music critics. James Hunter of Rolling Stone noted that, the excellent current single 'Scream' or the first rate R B ballad 'You Are Not Alone' manage to link the incidents of Jackson's infamous recent past to universal concepts, like injustice or isolation. When he bases his music in the bluntness of hip hop, Jackson sketches funky scenarios denouncing greed, blanket unreliability and false accusation . Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that it was the only conventional love song on the new material on HIStory. He compared it to Mariah Carey's song Hero and said it sounds like a surefire hit . In more recent years, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic expressed the opinion that You Are Not Alone was amongst some of the best songs Jackson ever released, calling the song seductive. The R B critic and journalist Nelson George described the song as lovely and supple. Writer and journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote of the song in 2004, remains among Michael's best songs ... On listening to 'You Are Not Alone', one wonders how many times Michael tried to tell himself, during his most desperate and anguished times, that he did have support in his life, from a higher power, or even friends and family, whether he actually believed it or not . Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described it as the best song on the album. Conversely, while Steve Holsey of Michigan Chronicle gave the album a positive review, he described the song as the worst on the album, calling the Kelly penned lyrics trite and below the standard set by Jackson's own lyrical skills. You Are Not Alone received an American Music Award nomination and a Grammy nomination both for Best Pop Vocal Performance . Commercially, You Are Not Alone remains one of Jackson's best selling singles and it is also his 13th number one song. It holds the Guinness World Record for the first song ever to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was also Jackson's last number one single on the chart. It debuted at number one with first week sales of 120,000 copies. The song was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold one million copies domestically. It broke the record set by his previous single Scream Childhood, which was the first song in the 37 year history of Billboard to debut at number fivewhere it peaked. It peaked at number one in the UK after a debut at number three in the prior week. The song also reached number one in Wallonia, France, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In Canada it peaked at number 2. With the exception of Italy, it became a top ten hit in every major market. The music video was directed by Wayne Isham on July 12, 1995 and begins with a large number of paparazzi taking photographs of Jackson. The plot then centers around two locations a temple where Jackson appears in an affectionate semi nude scene with his then wife, Lisa Marie Presley, and a theater where Jackson performs the song to an empty hall. Jackson also appears alone in other locations such as deserts and along tide pools. The slightly extended version that appeared on HIStory on Film, Volume II was notable for scenes where special effects were used to give Jackson white, feathery, almost angelic wings. Several of these scenes included Michael's side having been pierced by an arrow. The other version of the video is included on Number Ones and Michael Jackson's Vision. The temple scenes were a homage to Maxfield Parrish's 1922 painting Daybreak. The theater scenes were filmed at the Pantages Theatre, in Los Angeles. Michael first performed You Are Not Alone at the 1995 Soul Train Music Awards, then at the 1995 BET Awards and also at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. At the latter awards ceremony, the song was performed without the second verse. Jackson then performed the song at the Royal Brunei concert in 1996 where it was performed as a complete song. Jackson also performed it during the HIStory World Tour as a complete song, during which one lucky girl was allowed to dance with him on stage, similar to the Soul Train Music Awards performance. Michael's next performance of You Are Not Alone was at the MJ Friends concert in Seoul on June 25, 1999 this also turned out to be the song's last performance by Jackson himself, occurring ten years to the day of his death. The song was performed without the second verse, similar to the 1995 MTV Awards performance. The song was also due to be performed at the This Is It concert series, however the shows were cancelled due to his untimely death. Diana Ross recorded a version of this song on her international only released album, Voice of Love produced by Nick Martinelli. Diana would also close her successful 2010 12 More Today Than Yesterday The Greatest Hits Tour with this song as a tribute to Jackson. sales figures based on certification alone shipments figures based on certification alone The final twelve acts from the sixth series of TV talent show The X Factor in the United Kingdom released a cover version of the song on November 15, 2009 in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital.

All of her old friends gather at the wedding, making jokes and trying to embarrass her somewhat older husband. They are surprised that their past emotions have transformed into deep friendship and serenity. Ching teng begins to work on a web novel about his experiences with Chia yi. Later, when they gather to congratulate the bride and groom, the friends joke that they should be able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have happened had he apologized for being childish. You Are the Apple of My Eye is based on Giddens' semi autobiographical novel of the same name. He changed some details of the story to make the film more dramatic for example, Ching teng and Chia yi's fight actually took place over the phone, not in the rain as depicted. Giddens said, although some of the reasons for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged . Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me. Also, if the film is not nice, it will be a letdown to Chen tung and Michelle, who have been working so hard . At first, the film was on a tight budget Giddens used his entire savings and mortgaged his house to raise money, saying that he did it to impress ex girlfriend, who provided the inspiration for this film's female protagonist, Shen Chia yi. Executive producer Angie Chai also played a key role in raising money for the film. Michelle Chen was the first cast member confirmed by the director. Mypaper reported that Giddens was attracted to her during their first meeting, saying that she resembled the real Shen Chia yi. Chen had previously starred in Taiwanese television drama series such as Why Why Love and Miss No Good, although she was better known for her 2009 film Hear Me. Chen went on a diet to lose weight for the role, saying she wished to not disappoint the director . Giddens later used her as a basis to select the other cast members. The selection process for the male lead was the longest, and a series of auditions attracted several celebrities. Giddens chose first time actor Ko Chen tung because he felt he showed great improvement in his acting skills in each successive audition. Giddens liked his attitude, having seen Ko Chen tung hiding in a corner, frantically studying the script just before his audition. The director chose Ao chuan, Yen Sheng yu, Hao Shao wen, and Tsai Chang hsien to play the roles of his high school friends. He described Hao Shao wen as being a persuasive speaker, Tsai Chang hsien as being a very good prankster, and Ao chuan as self confident. Hu Chia wei played herself as a teenager. Giddens describes the two of them as the Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai of the publishing world . Giddens' mother told him that she would like either Lotus Wang or Phoebe Huang to play her in the film. In the end, Giddens settled on Lotus Wang, because she did not have any other work commitments at that time. Ko Chen tung's real father plays the father in the film. You Are the Apple of My Eye was primarily filmed at Ching Cheng High School , the school Giddens and Shen Chia yi attended. The director said he chose the school because he wanted so badly to see Ko Chen tung and Michelle Chen in the school uniform that he remembered vividly . The filming of the school scenes could only be done during the Taiwanese school holidays. Because the main location was at the school, it was decided to film the remainder of the film on location throughout Changhua County. The filming had a reported budget of NT 50 million approx. US 1.67M in January 2012 . Childish , a song from the film, was written and sung by Michelle Chen. Giddens was so touched by the song that he shed tears on the spot after first hearing it in particular, he liked the song's lyrics. He also praised Michelle's dedication to her role, saying I believe that the reason that she managed to get inspiration to write this song is because she likes her role . Giddens was also involved in some of this film's theme songs, including Those Years . At first Giddens could not decide on the closing theme for this film however, after hearing one of Japanese composer Mitsutoshi Kimura's new compositions he chose it and added lyrics. The Lonely Caffeine had been composed by Giddens for Shen Chia Yi when the two were in a relationship. He asked the male lead actor to sing the song in the film, because he felt this would convey the song's original meaning. Those Years was an instant hit. The music video on YouTube logged its ten millionth viewer on 11 November 2011, leading Giddens to note that the song broke every notable viewership record set by a Chinese language video on Youtube . In the Taiwanese KKBOX singles daily charts, Those Years remained at the top for 64 consecutive days, from 22 August to 22 October 2011, breaking the previous record of 45 consecutive days. The song was nominated for the Best Original Film Soundtrack award at the 48th Golden Horse Awards. You Are the Apple of My Eye was edited over for its various releases due to its controversial content. In Taiwan, the film was initially given a Restricted film classification. Giddens was extremely upset by this, and even personally went to Government Information Office to appeal. The film had to be edited 4 times in order to lower its classification. In the end, the film received a Guidance classification, meaning that children above 12 are able to watch it. In Malaysia, the scene where the students masturbated in the classroom was deleted. In Singapore, the film remained unedited, but it received a NC 16 rating, thus restricting the film to viewers above 16. The film was heavily edited for its Mainland China release. The scene where a flag raising ceremony was taking place was edited away, as were the scenes involving masturbation. In total, six scenes involving negative sexual and pro Taiwan content were either edited away or changed. The director also had to add new scenes in order to make the story flow more smoothly after editing. The original soundtrack album for You Are the Apple of My Eye was released by Sony Music Entertainment Taiwan on 5 August 2011. It contains six songs with vocals and nine instrumental pieces that were used in this film. You Are the Apple of My Eye made its debut in competition at the 13th Taipei Film Festival on 25 June 2011. The film made its international debut as the opening film for the sixth Summer International Film Festival in Hong Kong. It then had its general release in Taiwan on 19 August 2011. The film was screened at the 24th Tokyo International Film Festival on 24 October 2011, where the director and cast were present. It was well received, with audiences reportedly squeezing into the cinema to the extent that people had to sit in the aisles. Internationally, the film was released in Hong Kong and Macau on 20 October and in Singapore and Malaysia on 10 November 2011. On 21 December, Giddens announced on his blog that the film passed the censorship board in China and would debut in that country on 6 January 2012. Giddens had previously expressed a wish for the film to be screened in China so Shen Chia Yi, for whom he had made the film, could see it and comment. Giddens was unhappy when Chinese censors cut much of the film's negative sexual and pro Taiwan content . He apologized to viewers in China for being unable to deliver on his promise to show the full story, saying that he blamed only himself . He added that he did not think that the China's version was better . Giddens revealed that negotiations were ongoing for the film's release in Europe and the United States. The film subsequently made its North American debut at the New York Asian Film Festival on 2 July 2012. It was later screened at the 2012 Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal. Giddens also announced that a sequel will be produced it will begin production in 2013, and is expected to be released in cinemas in 2014.

Maggie Lee of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a larky retro coming of age confection .

Film Business Asia gave the film a rating of 7 10, with Derek Elley describing it as a confident feature and slickly packaged in every department , the latter making it easy to miss the fact there's nothing at all original here . He praised the cast as well chosen individually and relaxed as an ensemble . He added, apart from a slightly draggy second half, the material sustains itself at almost two hours, with generally trim editing by co executive director Liao. He concluded by summarizing the film's plot as a simple teenage rom com, a will they won't they between two opposites, but capped by a neat finale that does deliver some real emotion .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Are%20the%20Apple%20of%20My%20Eye
"You Are the One Spanish Sos mi vida, lit. You Are My Life is a 2006 Argentine romantic comedy television series, directed by Rodolfo Antunez and Jorge Bechara and broadcast by El Trece between 16 January 2006, and 9 January 2007. It is the second telenovela starring Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro as lead actors. The production included many location shootings, even during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, and many guest stars. The plot follows the love story of Martin Quesada, an affluent businessman, and Esperanza Munoz, a struggling female boxer who becomes his personal assistant. During its broadcast its overall rating averaged 26.9 points. It was critically acclaimed, and won four Martin Fierro Awards and three Clarin Awards. It was sold to more than 40 countries and had remakes in Mexico, Poland and Portugal. The telenovela was produced by Pol ka based on a premise by Adrian Suar, which he formulated nearly six months before the show's premiere, after discussion with his partner Javier Blanco y Tevah. The premise involves a rich businessman and former Formula 1 racing driver who falls in love with a poor woman looking for work in his emporium. Suar requested scripts from Ernesto Korovsky and Sebastian Parrotta, the authors of Gasoleros and El sodero de mi vida, and Hombres de honor and Padre Coraje respectively. The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antunez and produced by Cesar Markus Gonzalez. Most of the filming was done in the Pol ka studio at the Colegiales neighborhood, using outdoor scenes unconventional for the genre. The telenovela features Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, who both appeared in the successful telenovela Muneca Brava, as lead actors. The relationship between the two was more than professional Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muneca Brava, the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters. Natalia Oreiro plays Esperanza Munoz, a female boxer nicknamed La Monita . Oreiro was inspired by the singer Gilda to outline the character's personality. The main location is a tenement in the neighborhood of La Boca where Esperanza lives with other characters. Her adoptive mother Nieves lives with Enrique Quique Ferreti, her natural son and Esperanza's childhood boyfriend. The writers drafted Quique's general outlines Belloso defined most of his personality, including the relationship with Esperanzawhich is halfway between engagement and brotherhoodand his Oedipus complex with his mother. Esperanza trains as a boxer in a neighbourhood gymnasium with Quique, who has a wrestling gimmick as Commander Ray . Other main characters in the series are actress Nilda Yadhur, known as The Turk , and Paraguayan janitor Kimberly. The character of Martin Quesada establishes a context of wealthy characters. Quesada is a businessman and Formula 1 driver, but is not presented as selfish or greedy as is the archetype of entrepreneurs in soap operas. The two locations associated with him are the Quesada Group office, presided over by him, and his home. The office has the characters of Quesada's chief adviser Alfredo Uribe, the secretary Mercedes, and his cousin Miguel Quesada, who serves as vice president, and the lawyer Felix Perez Garmendia. His girlfriend Constanza Insua and his cousin Debbie are also included. Martin lives with his housekeeper Rosa, Rosa's grandson Tony, and three adopted orphan siblings, Jose, Laura, and Coqui. Another recurring site is the apartment of Miguel and Debbie, which would be also used as the house of Constanza or Garmendia if needed. The story begins during a boxing match of Esperanza Munoznicknamed Monita who has sustained a hand injury. Her manager, Enrique Quique Ferreti, is pressuring her to continue fighting, despite her pain. This injury complicates her economic situation, as her boxing provides the only income for her adoptive family, namely Quique and his mother, Maria de las Nieves. Nieves loves Esperanza like her own daughter, and pressures her to marry Quique. Her neighbor Kimberly suggests that Esperanza apply for a job in the Quesada Group, where she works as a janitress. The secretary Mercedes rejects Esperanza due to her violent manners and her dressing style. Martin Quesada, the president of the company, sees Esperanza crying in the street and hires her as his personal assistant. Martin also meets three orphan siblings, Jose, Laura, and Coqui, who resisted being adopted by different families. He takes them to his home, and starts the legal proceedings to adopt them. Martin begins to like Esperanza, but his girlfriend Constanza, a cold, manipulative, and malicious woman, is wary of her. Esperanza does not tell Martin about her relations with Quique, instead pretending to be his sister. She also does not tell Martin that she is a boxer. Quique and Constanza begin their own relationship, unknown by most other characters. Martin breaks off his relationship with Esperanza when he sees her goodbye kiss with Quique, as he realizes that she was lying to him. After the breakup with Esperanza, Martin resumes his romance with Constanza and eventually proposes marriage to her, in order to improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martin, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martin finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martin wants to keep them. Due to the efforts of Martin's cousin Miguel, the unscrupulous lawyer Falucho , and Constanza, Martin gradually loses his fortune, his business, and his house. He moves to the Conventillo and works as a taxi driver. Eventually, he recovers everything. A new character, Barbara, temporarily joins the love triangle of Martin, Esperanza, and Constanza. Constanza gets pregnant by Quique and tries to pass off her son as Martin's, but fails. Martin finally marries Esperanza and has a family with her and the adopted children. Constanza moves in with Quique. The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antunez, and produced by Cesar Markus Gonzalez. Most of the filming occurred at the headquarters of Pol ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martin Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins Arena stadium during the Argentina Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 60 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Lenas in the Andes. A simulated aircraft crash that left the characters in a jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Moron. To make her performances as a female boxer look realistic, Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuna and her coach Ramon Chaparro. They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring and how to make various types of strokes, and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training. Acuna commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, which was the first of its kind in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside. Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio. The program's opening theme is Gilda's Corazon Valiente Spanish Braveheart , sung by Oreiro. It was produced by Toti Gimenez, widower and producer of the late Gilda. Oreiro is a fan of Gilda and chose this song as a homage to mark the 10th anniversary of her death. She considered including it in her next music CD, but did not record anything afterwards. The program featured several guest stars, who appeared in secondary or support roles in several episodes. Some guest starssuch as the singers Chayanne, Ricky Martin and Julieta Venegasplayed themselves within the fiction of the program. Venegas' song Tu Nombre is used as a background song in romantic settings. Marcela Acuna appeared twice, playing herself in a match against Oreiro's character. The appearance of actress Leticia Bredice was nominated for the best cameo in fiction category at the Martin Fierro Awards the prize was given to Nora Carpena. Actress Reina Reech delayed other projects to take part in the program. The program expanded the usual conventions of the genre by using several types of metafiction, referencing the actors themselves or the nature of the program. An example within the plot is Sos mi muqui, a program within the program whose characters were based on the show's main characters. The actors' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that place them in similar contexts than those of older fictions. Martin infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana's character in Padre Coraje wore, and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro's character in Muneca Brava wore when they had to get into a slum. Many actors played minor characters as well as their main roles. Pablo Cedron played a Paraguayan brother of his character Falucho both characters were involved in a love triangle with Kimberly. Carlos Belloso was cast as Quique's lost sister, dressed as a woman. Natalia Oreiro, who speaks Russian fluently, took the role of a Russian princess. Facundo Arana played a criminal, a role unlike Martin. Those scenes did not use special effects each character was filmed separately without the two characters sharing the screen. The hero of the telenovela marries the villain, contrary to the genre's usual convention in which such a wedding is interrupted or canceled at the last moment. The program was first broadcast in January, a month of low television activity in Argentina because of the summer vacations. Nevertheless, it was highly successful. The competitor channel Telefe aired the teen comedy Alma Pirata, which was rescheduled because of its low ratings, and replaced it with the second season of Casados con Hijos. Both programs had similar ratings until the end of Casados con Hijos in August. With an average rating of 26.8 points, Sos mi vida ended as the most watched Argentine television fiction so far it was displaced by the 2009, telenovela Valientes, which received 27.3 rating points. The program was awarded the best TV comedy at the 2006 ceremony of the Martin Fierro Awards, prevailing over Casados con hijos and Quien es el Jefe . Facundo Arana received the award for best lead actor in comedy, prevailing over Guillermo Francella, Humberto Tortonese, and Nicolas Vazquez. Natalia Oreiro won the award for the best lead actress in comedy, prevailing over Florencia Pena, Nancy Duplaa, Carmen Barbieri, and Andrea Bonelli. Alejandro Awada, Marcelo Mazzarello, and Carlos Belloso received nominations for supporting comedy actor awards, which was won by Belloso. Similarly, three of five nominations for supporting comedy actress went to Carla Peterson, Monica Ayos and Claudia Fontan, but the award went to Erika Rivas of Casados con hijos. The program was unsuccessfully nominated for best theme song and best guest appearance for Leticia Bredice. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were nominated again at the 2007 Martin Fierro Awards. These nominations proved controversial because the program only lasted for a week in 2007, and had no second season, and both actors took a recess from work after it. Neither of them received an award for those nominations. Oreiro won the newly created award for the best dressed actress of the night, which is not part of the official awards. At the Clarin Awards ceremony in late 2006, the program was awarded for the best comedy, prevailing over Casados con hijos and Alma Pirata. Elias Vinoles won the award for best actor, Ornella Fazio was nominated for best female actor the award was given to Maria Abadi of Montecristo. Unlike the Martin Fierro, the Clarin awards do not distinguish between lead and supporting actors. Belloso was awarded as best comedy actor Oreiro was nominated and the award was given to Erika Rivas. The Clarin newspaper attributes the success of the program to the actors' performances, the subplots, production initiatives, and the original treatment of stories. The work of the supporting cast was also praised, including Carla Peterson, Fabiana Garcia Lago, and Marcelo Mazzarello. The newspaper La Nacion praised the show's mix of sitcom humor and telenovela drama, and equated the dramatic episodes to the works of renowned telenovela authors Abel Santa Cruz, Alberto Migre, and Delia Fiallo. The program was criticized for the length of timenearly three monthsbefore the lead couple's first kiss. Clarin also criticized a badly performed striptease act by Facundo Arana. As Carlos Belloso could not go with Arana and Oreiro to the filming at the World Cup, he was filmed in the Plaza San Martin, pretending that he was in Germany as well. The program's scheduled broadcast time was 21 00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast by up to 40 minutes. This led to conflicts with other channels and COMFER, the institution that regulates Argentine television. The last episode lasted for half an hour and was followed by the premiere of the new telenovela Son de Fierro La Nacion said that the final episode should have lasted a full hour. The program was initially aired in Argentina in 2006 on El Trece at prime time. Following the success of the initial run, El Trece and Volver reran the show. It is sold internationally by the Dori Media Group under the English name You Are The One to more than 40 countries. The concept of the program was sold as well, and some countries remade the telenovela with local actors. The Mexican version, Un gancho al corazon, starred Danna Garcia, Sebastian Rulli, Laisha Wilkins, and Raul Araiza. The characters were renamed, but Garcia's character retained the sobriquet La Monita . The Polish version, Prosto w serce, starred Anna Mucha, Filip Bobek, and Magorzata Socha. The Portuguese version, Deixa me amar, starred Paulo Pires and Paula Lobo Antunes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Are%20the%20One%20%28Argentine%20TV%20series%29

The song is one of the best selling singles worldwide, with worldwide sales of more than 7 million units according to the IFPI . The song's accompanying music video was directed by Roman White. The video featured Swift portraying two characters, a nerd the protagonist and narrator and a popular girl the antagonist and girlfriend , while American actor Lucas Till portrayed the male lead. The video's plot centers on the protagonist secretively loving the male lead, although he has a girlfriend. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, but during Swift's acceptance speech, rapper Kanye West interrupted, protesting in support of Beyonce. The incident caused a reaction in the media, with many coming to Swift's defense. The song was performed live at numerous venues, including the 200910 Fearless Tour, where it was the opening number. It has been covered by various artists, including Butch Walker and Selena Gomez the Scene, and parodied by Weird Al Yankovic. Swift became inspired to write You Belong with Me after she overheard a male friend of hers speaking to his girlfriend on the phone. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, No, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything Baby, Im so sorry. Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, Youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset she's going off about something that you said. Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl next door itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time. Swift recalled, It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T shirts'. You Belong with Me was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009. You Belong with Me is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds. According to Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine, it is a straight up pop song. The song is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 130 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F major and Swift's vocals spans a little below two octaves, from F 3 to C 5. Swift hints at her country music background in the banjo inflected introduction of the song. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly felt Swift's vocals were light and twangy while the melody was lilting . It follows the chord progression F CGm B. The instrumentation consists of clucking banjos alongside new wave electric guitars. The lyrics to You Belong with Me alternate between narrative modes, where she speaks of herself, a male friend whom she has an unrequited crush on, and his girlfriend. Greenblatt described Swift's role as a storyteller, the song being a narrative set to music, which describes concerning about love and boys just very hard to catch . Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter believes You Belong with Me 's plot is confessional and regards scenarios themed with high school, while Swift is the girl next door who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music . Lucy Davies of the BBC noted, Swift deals in the prosaic imagery of high school boys . In one verse, Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, She wears high heels, I wear sneakers She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers , which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend. In the choruses, Swift attempts to persuade some boy to come to his senses and submit to her everygirl charms . Sean Dooley of About.com labeled You Belong with Me as one of the best songs on Fearless , while Johnny Davis of The Observer believed some parts of the song may needle British ears , although he felt that it was better than single releases by pop singer Hilary Duff.

She opined that You Belong with Me 's lyrical palette has few colours ... and it's repetitive . Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said, 'You Belong with Me' isn't her best written song by a long shot, but it's hard to fault its construction.

A Times Editor review from The St. Petersburg Times also described it as sounding similar to other hits She hankers for a boy who either doesn't love her back or wants to ditch this small town. Josh Love of The Village Voice thought preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness shined through the lyrics and theme of You Belong with Me Love also mentioned that it was one of Fearless' great songs . The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is slick and radio friendly . Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download You Belong with Me , and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups. Webb said, It continues the artist's tradition of having a little something for everyone, so it's no wonder she has such a large fanbase.

The song received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year but lost to Beyonce's Single Ladies Put a Ring on It 2008 , for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year but lost to Kings of Leon's Use Somebody 2008 , and for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance but lost to Beyonce's Halo 2009 .

In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift becomes who she really is , while Swift thought it was a happy ending. Swift commented, One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me. The video was shot in two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville, Tennessee. On the first day of filming, Swift used a body double in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot.

Meanwhile, Swift the protagonist stares in amazement. Back looking at each other through their bedroom windows, Till and Swift again communicate through signs. Till asks Swift the protagonist if she was attending prom and she responds, no, studying . Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves, and she changes her mind.

"You Can Dance is the first remix album by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was released on November 17, 1987, by Sire Records. The album contains remixes of tracks from her first three studio albumsMadonna 1983 , Like a Virgin 1984 and True Blue 1986 and a new track, Spotlight . In the 1980s, remixing was still a new concept and technology, by which a particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass. Madonna became interested in the concept, noting that she hated when others remixed her songs and wanted to do it by herself. Madonna turned to her old friend and producer John Jellybean Benitez to help her remix the songs, and also enlisted the help of Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at other times, the drums are removed with only the hi hat left to keep time. The album cover denoted Madonna's continuous fascination with Hispanic culture. After its release, You Can Dance received generally positive reviews from critics, some of whom noted how the already known songs appeared to them in a complete new structure, calling it an essential album to be played at parties. You Can Dance was a commercial success, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA for shipment of a million copies, and reaching the top twenty of the Billboard 200. It reached the top ten of the album charts of France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom, and went on to sell five million copies worldwide, making it the second best selling remix album of all time, behind only Blood on the Dance Floor from Michael Jackson. Spotlight was the only single released from the album in Japan, but charted on the airplay charts of Billboard due to radio play and peaked at number 32. In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records commissioned the release of You Can DanceMadonna's first retrospectivewhich was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid eighties, post disco dance music was extremely popular and the concept of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machineall went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass. It was this concept which intrigued Madonna, while she was developing her third studio album True Blue 1986 . She said, I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for the kids in the clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way. She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes. Patrick Leonard talking about working on the album. Madonna turned to her old friend and producer John Jellybean Benitez to help her remixing the songs, and also enlisted the help of Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. Together they chose six of Madonna's old songs and decided to give it a remixed form. The songs chosen were Holiday , Everybody and Physical Attraction from Madonna 1983 , Into the Groove and Over and Over from Like a Virgin 1984 , and lastly, Where's the Party from True Blue. Along with the pre released tracks, a never before released song called Spotlight was included as a bonus. Madonna said that she was inspired by the song Everybody Is a Star 1970 , by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone. Written by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson, Spotlight was originally recorded during the True Blue recording sessions. It was omitted from the album because Madonna felt that it was similar in composition and structure to Holiday . After the remixing of the songs started, Benitez noted, We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums be How much should the vocals stand out ' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music. Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime. The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi hat left to keep time. The album cover denoted Madonna's continued fascination with Spanish culture and fashion. She wore a female toreador outfit with a lacy bustier, embroidered bolero jacket and a cummerbund with a flouncy bustle. Jeri Heiden, who had worked on the cover art for True Blue, was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album cover. Shot by Herb Ritts, the cover showed Madonna again as a platinum blond. Heiden explained in an interview with Aperture magazine in October 2006 that the cover was not meant to be a tie in with the True Blue cover. It was just Madonna's look at the time Platinum Blond. And of course the handwriting reappears on that album. The album sleeve included a free poster and the gold wrap around liner notes contained approximate running time to indicate the difference between the length of the remix and the original track. Brian Chin, a Rolling Stone journalist, wrote the liner notes for the album, explaining the process of remix and why the seven songs were chosen for the track list. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, Improvements in studio technology meant that possibilities for shaping the sound after it has been recorded are almost limitless. Such possibility were applied in the song composition and the remixes present in You Can Dance. Previously to change the sound of an instrument, or to jump from one sound to another, recordings used to stop playing the instrument and the drums at that point. But for the remixes on You Can Dance, the fade engineering technology was applied to the songs, wherein the fader was simply pulled down, and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made to come up to the surface. The first song on the album is Spotlight which begins with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, followed by Madonna uttering the words Spotlight, shine bright . After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words Pa da pa da pappa pappa pa pa in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that everybody is a star and that if one wants to be famous and be under the spotlight , the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her. According to the sheet music for the song, is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B5. Spotlight has a basic sequence of AmCAmCGF as its chord progression. The second track is Holiday , which Benitez said that he always wanted to remix, commenting There are new sounds on the 1987 remix of 'Holiday' , but it had a groove that needed no improvement. The sound of the guitar is brought to the front in the remix, with a piano break and a middle section consisting of drum beats. The mix for Everybody starts with four repetitions of the vocal hook and then moves into a rhythm centered arrangement. Like Holiday , the middle section of Everybody features a drum break, with a synth tune backing it up. The word dance is echoed and slowed down continuously through the break, gradually changing into the intermedia verse. At the very end, the drums are pulled out, leaving Madonna repeating the get up and do your thing phrase, which hovers over to the intro of the next song Physical Attraction . It begins with the arrangement of the original song, until the middle eight, where the composition is varied. A disconcerting sound is present at the end of the track, which, after sometime increases in volume until then next track Over and Over begins. In the Into the Groove remix, overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase c'mon . The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix. After the first Now I know you're mine line is sung, there is a percussion break, and repetition of the phrases step to the beat and c'mon . The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals, causing overlap of the phrases. The remix ends with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican ending. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that keeps the spotlight on her first record, adding non LP singles like 'Into the Groove' for good measure, along with a bonus track of 'Where's the Party'. Since it is a dance album, it doesn't matter that 'Holiday' and 'Into the Groove' are here twice, once each in dub versions, because the essential grooves and music are quite different in each incarnation. It is true that some of this now sounds datedthese are quite clearly extended mixes from the mid 80sbut that's part of its charm, and it all holds together quite well. Not essential, but fun. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau considered that the effects, repeats, breaks, and segues added by a star crew of remixers ... amount to new musicthis time the songs don't surface, they reach out and grab you . He also argued that You Can Dance reminded the audience that before MTV, they loved the way she sounded . Author J. Randy Taraborrelli noted that You Can Dance made one point clear about Madonna. While she was evolving into a serious pop star, musically she still knew how to host the best party. He complimented the remixed versions of Holiday , Everybody , Physical Attraction and Into the Groove . Timothy Green from The Miami Herald said that got a good beat and you can dance to it. Madonna's new album isn't really new, but rather a collection of danceable hits, remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking the artists' work, track by track, and reconstructing it. Most such remixes become 12 inch dance singles, and You Can Dance, is basically a compilation of these. The remixes sound fresh and gives a new outlook on the already famous and popular songs. However, Daniel Brogan from the same newspaper praised the album, saying that Madonna has brought a new joy to the people buying gifts for Christmas, as You Can Dance is a fun filled, fast paced retrospective that will burn the dance floor till New Year. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post called the album an energetic collection of extended dance remixes, that will surely be the highlight of the party crowds flocking around the town. John Milward from USA Today felt that although the remixes sound a little exhaustive, its nevertheless party time with Madonna's album. Jan DeKnock from the Chicago Tribune was not impressed with the album, calling it calculative. In the United States, the album was released on November 18, 1987, and reached a peak of number 14 on the Billboard 200. The LP cuts debuted at number 41 on the Dance Music Club Play chart, and moved up to number 17 the next week.

"You Can't Win is an R B, pop and soul song written by Charlie Smalls and performed by American recording artist Michael Jackson, who played Scarecrow in the 1978 musical film The Wiz, an urbanized retelling of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The movie featured an entirely African American cast and was based on the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz. After the original soundtrack version was recorded, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones went back into the studio and re recorded the track. It was the re recording that was released in January 1979 as the second single from The Wiz Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, following the release of Ease On Down the Road in 1978, and was Michael's first solo chart single on Epic Records despite the fact that the soundtrack album for The Wiz was released by Motown and the now defunct MCA Records . The 7 inch version split the song in half, with Part 1 as the A side and Part 2 as the B side the full length version was released as a 12 inch single and later was included on The Ultimate Collection in 2004. The single only charted in the United States, where it reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 42 on the R B singles chart. Since its release, the song has been well received by music critics. The song has been performed by contemporary singers such as Jill Scott and Charles Grigsby. In 1982 Part 2 of You Can't Win , in which Michael Jackson repeatedly sings the line Can't get outta the game , was vocally overdubbed, and the resulting track was titled Can't Get Outta the Rain it became the B side of The Girl Is Mine , the first single from Jackson's landmark album Thriller. Despite Can't Get Outta the Rain being melodically identical to You Can't Win , as well as lyrically identical except for the word rain , Jackson and Quincy Jones are credited as the song's composers, not Charlie Smalls. You Can't Win was originally written and performed during the pre Broadway Baltimore run of the stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves. The number was cut from the musical before the official Broadway opening and wasn't performed again until the movie version was under consideration, 3 years later. The producers resurrected the song as a solo for Michael Jackson to replace I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday , which had been Scarecrow's solo in the Broadway musical. You Can't Win and its corresponding scene in the movie allude to mistreatment of African Americans. Jackson stated in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that the lyrics to You Can't Win are about humiliation and helplessness, feelings, he stated, that many people have experienced at one point in their life. The singer added that the song was also about the feeling that there are people out there who don't actively hold you back as much as they work quietly on your insecurities so that you hold yourself back . You Can't Win opens with the lines, You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same. William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made You Can't Win a black message song . Musically, the track has been described as an R B, pop and soul song by Renee Graham of The Boston Globe. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80 beats per minute. It adds that the song is composed in E with a range from B3 to C5. The scene that corresponds with You Can't Win in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale played by Diana Ross , stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while stuck in the air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role and there is nothing to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, he would not be able to walk as he is a straw paper dummy . Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their Crow Commandments Thou shall honor all crows , Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature and Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole . In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, You Can't Win . After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing Ease on Down the Road as they go. The song is also heard in The Wiz Live , replacing I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday . Elwood Watson, author of Pimps, Wimps, Studs, Thugs and Gentlemen Essays on Media Images of Masculinity, states that The Wiz offers an important allegorical treatment of ordinary African American men living in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement . Watson writes that while the crows do not intend to cause physical harm to Scarecrow, the beginning of their scene recalls experiences of the ritual lynching of black men in the United States. The author states that the crows' refusal to allow Scarecrow to read literature was reminiscent of laws that forbade black slaves from being educated. Watson writes, Scarecrow's desire for knowledge that will help him interpret the discourses and institutions that shape his life signifies on the slave narrative. With its emphasis on literacy and freedom, African American slave narratives document that for many African Americans literacy was understood as an essential path to freedom. Watson continues The Crows' insistence that reading is useless, even dangerous for Scarecrow because it only leads to discontentment takes on an especially haunting reminder of the ways in which the residues of slavery continue to injure contemporary African Americans. The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their hands through a song whose refrain you can't win child, you can't get out of the game that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom ... Their insistence that reading is stupid suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from the game that race and racism create ... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they perceive to be real knowledge street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song is revealing for what it says about their loss of hope ... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility. Watson continued his analysis, writing that despite the crows' attempts to erode Scarecrow's confidence, gives no indication that he intends to abort his efforts to liberate himself physically and intellectually. Watson concluded his study of Scarecrow and his scene by stating, His encounter with Dorothy will help him to realize, contrary to The Crow's assertions, that Scarecrow's pursuit of knowledge can indeed help him to win opportunities for improving his life. In January 1979, You Can't Win was released as the second single from The Wiz Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, a double album distributed by Motown Records in September 1978. The single was issued after the September 1978 release of Ease on Down the Road , a duet between Jackson and Diana Ross, who played protagonist Dorothy Gale in The Wiz. You Can't Win was distributed under Epic Records, and was Jackson's first solo single issued by the company after Epic executives signed him and his brothers to the label in 1976. You Can't Win entered Billboard's R B singles chart on January 20, 1979. It reached number 42 and remained in the chart for ten weeks. A month later, on February 24, 1979, it entered the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 81. The single stayed in the chart for three weeks. In May 1979, You Can't Win was released in Britain, as was a 7 picture disc of the song. The single failed to enter the British charts. When Jackson's Off the Wall was first released in August 1979, the picture disc supplemented the album. Since its release, You Can't Win has received positive reviews from music critics. A journalist from the Kansas City Star said that the song was the best one from The Wiz. Kenny Mack of the Santa Monica Daily Press asserted that Jackson's famous vulnerability and the power of his voice on 'You Can't Win' combined for perfect casting in the film. The Boston Globe's Renee Graham stated in 2005, Halfway through the , Jackson lets out a whoop, and the tune evolves from a pop soul confection into a true R B delight, spiced with barking horns and hand claps as funky and loose as anything Jackson has ever done. Writer Geoff Brown wrote in his book Michael Jackson A Life in Music that the singer's performance of You Can't Win in The Wiz was one of the few bright moments in a drab remake of The Wizard of Oz . Margo Jefferson wrote in the biography On Michael Jackson that the entertainer sang the song in the film with rough, gospel edges of desperation . She added, The torment feels genuine. It's a painful scene. After Jackson's death in 2009, Edmund W. Lewis of The Louisiana Weekly said that he was still amazed at the quality of 's performance in The Wiz . He added, As the scarecrow, he sang the hell out of . You Can't Win has been referenced and performed on several occasions. In the 1982 blockbuster film E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, a snippet of the song is heard on a car radio. In 2001 Jill Scott performed the song during the Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Special celebration. In 2003, during the second season of American Idol, contestant Charles Grigsby sang You Can't Win for a movie theme night. An Entertainment Weekly writer said that the song choice was oddly appropriate , as the hopeful was eliminated from the competition after the performance. Decades after the release of You Can't Win , William F. Brown stated that the song had been dropped from his theater productions of The Wiz. He said this was because the musical was not a black message show, but a show for everybody to enjoy. He expressed the opinion that You Can't Win was no longer relevant, stating, It's all changed. Black people can win. Limited edition picture disc 7 inch single",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Can%27t%20Win%20%28song%29

You da One 's artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back and her eyes closed holding a cigarette between her lips.

According to Bradley Stern of MTV, the song's musical structure bore a resemblance to Britney Spears' Inside Out , writing that Rihanna gets squeezed between a killer dubstep to death breakdown, not unlike the ex sexin' jam Dr. Luke crafted for Britney's 'Femme Fatale' cut. James Montgomery of the same publication commented on the song's structure, writing that the song starts in traditional territory building on a slow, skanking rhythm expands with a starbursty chorus, then contracts nearly as quickly on a knotty, ratcheting middle. The lyrics to You da One are about a stable and comfortable relationship, which can be heard in the lyrics You know how to love me hard I won't lie, I'm falling hard Yup, I'm falling for ya, but there's nothing wrong with that. Michael Cragg of The Guardian explained some of the lyrics in the song as part of his review, writing It's perhaps less immediate, but there's a lovely pre chorus of 'My love is your love, your love is my love' that leads into a refrain about how great it is to have found someone decent, 'I'm so happy that you came in my life' . You da One garnered positive reviews from music critics. In regards to the song's sexually lewd demeanor, Jocelyn Vena of MTV News felt that Rihanna embodied a potty mouthed sex kitten Vena continued to write that the song is the most radio friendly on Talk That Talk, despite the excessive use of NSFW lyrics .

Leah Collins of Dose praised the lyrics in the song which she described as lovey dovey and most definitely radio friendly. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine commented on the infectiousness of the song, writing that once it has been listened to, it is hard to stop thinking about it. Martin continued to praise the sugary sweetness of the song , but criticized the incorporation of the dubstep breakdown toward the end of the song, citing that the reason as to why it was included was to try and make the song even bigger . Michael Cragg of The Guardian also noted that the song has a relaxed feel to it, and compared it to some of the singer's previous dancehall songs, What's My Name and Rude Boy . A reviewer for Spin criticized the song, writing is giving us a half limp reggae jam full of platitudes like, ' one I dream about all day'.

Rihanna later strips down to a flesh coloured leotard as she writhes on the floor with strategically placed artistic shards of light to create leopard spots and tiger stripes on her skin. Several scenes capture solely her mouth first with a gold grill covering her bottom row of teeth, and later with smoke billowing from her lips transitioning into and out of the words Dream and later You Da One . Another scene finds Rihanna in a white tank top and tattered jean shorts, swinging a cane in between two brick buildings.

Using the latter move, she is found in a black and white chequered background room where she moves around a larger than life playing card. The video ends with Rihanna running away from the camera and jumping into a chair, throwing her legs over the side with a smile on her face. A reviewer for Idolator described the video as glorious. Amy Sciarretto for PopCrush wrote Judging from the song's official video, it is, since RiRi cant keep her hands to herself. The black and white video features the newly blond singer cavorting in an array of black and white outfits, dancing, smiling, giggling and grabbing her crotch with a great degree of regularity. Hours after the release of the video, Norwegian photographer Slve Sundsb alleged that the scene of Rihanna wearing a white outfit with black dots shining on her pictured is the same as a photo shoot he completed in 2008 titled Numero 93' . A reviewer for Idolator wrote that the evidence really doesnt look to be in Rihanna's favor. The reviewer continued to write Not only are the projected shapes similar, but both Rihanna and the model are wearing nearly identical body suits and wigs though the color differs . Plus, those pink lips providing the only splash of color also look pretty familiar. A reviewer for The Huffington Post concurred with Idolator's observations, and noted The nakedness, the projections, the interplay of light and shadow... even the haircut were very similar to that of the work by Sundsbo.

"You Don't Know Jack is a 2011 video game of the party genre released by various home consoles and handhelds based on the series of You Don't Know Jack games. The game was developed by Jellyvision Games and published by THQ, and was released in North America on February 8, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first title in the series released by Jellyvision after an eight year hiatus, taking advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles. A single player iOS port was released about two months later, but was later pulled in anticipation of a more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game. The game is structured around a fictional game show emceed by Cookie Masterson voiced by Tom Gottlieb , in which the players answer ten multiple choice questions, and then compete in a final Jack Attack round. Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players' scores, while incorrect answers are penalized. As per the game's motto, the irreverent trivia party game , the questions often combine general knowledge with popular culture references and verbal wordplay to determine the correct answer. Unlike the earlier releases which randomly presented questions, the 2011 game provides more than 73 episodes with a predefined set of questions, and with further episodes to be made available as DLC, only available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through both consoles' respective online stores. The game, on consoles, supports both offline and online play with the exception of the Wii which lacks online multiplayer with up to four players, while the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS versions only support two local players and lack features such as online play and access to download various DLC Packs. You Don't Know Jack was generally well received, seen as a humorous return to form for the series, though the lack of online play or additional content for the Microsoft Windows version was criticized. You Don't Know Jack is played out as a fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money at the end of the game. Each game uses a pre defined set of ten questions from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money. Each player in multiplayer games is also given a single opportunity to screw another player, forcing them to answer the question in a much shorter time period. If the selected player answers incorrectly or fails to answer the question, they lose money which is gained by the player using the screw. However, if the selected player answers correctly, they gain additional money taken from the player using the screw. The game's trivia is based on general knowledge from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items the game, as well as the series, is often described as high culture meets pop culture . For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being He's Just Not That Into You . In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a Dis or Dat question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong. In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the Wrong Answer of the Game , which is hinted at by the show's sponsor for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer Cat's Cradle is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand. After ten questions are completed, the final round of the game is the Jack Attack where all players compete against each other. Prior to the round, a brief clue is shown to the players to describe a relationship that they must match, for example BFF Best friends forever . The game then shows one word or phrase, and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match. If players respond to the wrong phrase, they lose money only the first player to buzz in at the correct time wins and earns money. After seven such phrases, the total scores are added and the winner is determined. You Don't Know Jack was developed by Chicago based company Jellyvision. The You Don't Know Jack YDKJ series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with You Don't Know Jack The Ride. Though Jellyvision offered some web based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only realize You Don't Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in business to business communication including for tax software from H R Block and interviews for Equifax. Around 2008, the company saw that gaming consoles had developed features for connectivity and social play. They also recognized that the market for such trivia games was slim at the time and saw a possible opportunity to revitalize the series. Near this time, Jellyvision Labs was spun out to its own company, Jellyvision Games, LLC, which would later be reincorporated in 2011 as Jellyvision Games, Inc. Harry Gottlieb, the founder of Jellyvision, recognized that many of the same people that worked on the original games were still in the company, and proposed the idea of a new You Don't Know Jack title to publishers. After securing THQ as a publisher, full time development for the game started in February 2010. Steve Heinrich, the game's producer, said the development process was insanely quick , allowing them to work concurrently on writing, art, sound, and programming, and had the flexibility to make design decisions to keep the game simple and funny. However, the question writing staff found some of the deadlines to be too short, preventing them for doing extensive audience feedback. Jellyvision Games did not want to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game question types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in game achievements. Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games noted that compared to 1995, where the pop culture was fragmented , the onset of the Internet and social media made it easier to develop questions for the game. At the same time, with more information and entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About You were not. Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work. The majority of the game's dialogue is provided by Tom Gottlieb, brother of Harry, who had voiced the emcee Cookie Masterson in the earlier games, and had been considered one of the more popular emcees by players. Lacking any professional studio, most of the 100 200 hrs of game dialog were recorded in a makeshift soundproofed closet. Tom Gottlieb was also involved in the writing process, as Jellyvision Games credits much of the Cookie persona to his own performance of the character. Other sound effects include fake commercials that are heard before and after a game some of these include commercials used in previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. Prior to each questions, the game includes short musical interstitials with animated numbers to introduce the question via its number. These were designed as to get the music for these stuck in the players' heads as something they would remember throughout the day to avoid making these become too routine, certain episodes featured variations on the interstitial that would be unexpected, keeping players on their toes throughout playing the game. The game was released in North America on February 8, 2011. Jellyvision Games has stated they considered further international releases, but these would be too expensive at the present time. The company does not rule out future iterations of the game being released to a wider market based on the success of this title. An initial version of this version of You Don't Know Jack was released for iOS systems in April 2011. It featured twenty 10 question episodes, but was limited to a single player mode. Jellyvision Games later pulled the application, in anticipation of release of a more robust client for both iOS and Android that will mimic the Facebook application, featuring cross platform multiplayer between iOS, Android, and Facebook versions, and downloadable episodes from the Facebook game. You Don't Know Jack was positively received by critics who were delighted not only with a new entry in the series, but one that kept the same humor and wit as the earlier games. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times praised the triumphant, hilarious and even enlightening return of the series, citing the creativity of the writing and voice work. John Teti of The A.V. Club called the title an astonishingly good game , and was impressed that the writing of the game was as witty as the previous games in the series despite the years of dormancy. Though Teti lamented about the lack of keyboard bases questions, he praised the new question types and gameplay as the overall change minimizes blowouts and keeps the pace brisk . Greg Miller of IGN considered the game a great value, attributing it to the game's great sense of humor, clever rounds and enough questions to keep you busy for a while . Kevin Kelly of G4 TV praised the voice work, particularly that for Cookie , as Without Cookie, this game would quickly be just another forgettable trivia game . Jeff Cork of Game Informer considered the game proof that games dont need to be excessively complex in order to be fun , complimenting the top notch writing. Chris Watters of GameSpot commented that the structure of each episode can become repetitive, and that commonly the Jack Attack round would decide the winner of the game, negating the previous questions, but still considered the large amount of legitimately clever and surprisingly funny writing a key aspect of making You Don't Know Jack as one of the most entertaining trivia games on the market . Gamepro's Nathan Grayson was more critical of the game's lack of features, considering the number of questions painfully short compared to the Buzz trivia game series, the absolute bare bones basics presentation, and the game's somewhat juvenile sense of humor. Though the Toronto Sun's Steve Tilley generally praised the game's humor, he noted the lack of variety of gameplay modes, and that playing with people online may be spoiled by those that had already run through all the game's episodes. Both the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS versions were criticized for limiting the number of players to two. The Windows version was particularly criticized as it did not allow for online play, a feature available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases, nor would receive the downloadable content for the game. The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game's humor remained.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Don%27t%20Know%20Jack%20%282011%20video%20game%29
"You Don't Know What to Do is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey included on her fourteenth studio album, Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse 2014 , and features rapper Wale. The track was released on June 30, 2014, as the fourth single from the album. It was written by Wale, Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan Michael Cox, with production helmed by the latter three. The song contains an interpolation of I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez, both of whom received songwriting credits as a result. The single's artwork caused controversy when the media criticised Carey for photoshopping and re using images of herself. Carey herself later expressed her discontent on the matter, stating that she had no knowledge of the single's artwork until it was released. A disco revival song, the lyrics are about Carey being dissatisfied by her lover's failed attempts at romancing her. Despite being serviced to urban and rhythmic radio in the United States, Belgium and South Korea were the only territories where the song charted, peaking at number 14 on its Ultratip chart, which ranks the top songs that have yet to enter the main Ultratop 50 chart, and number 2 on the South Korea download chart. You Don't Know What to Do garnered critical acclaim amongst music critics many complimented the disco revival and throwback style, calling it the best track on the album, and compared it to the works of Jocelyn Brown, Daft Punk, Chic and post revivalist songs produced Pharrell Williams. Carey and Wale performed the song for the first time on the Today show in the United States. You Don't Know What to Do was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan Michael Cox, with featured artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair , written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off. I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, we came up with a few things that really, really a solid body of work . In August 2013, Wale revealed that he had been in the studio with Carey, posting the message Mariah x Wale x JD coming soon on his Twitter account. Then, on May 16, 2014, Carey and Wale premiered their collaboration, revealed to be called You Don't Know What to Do , live during a mini concert for Today held by Carey. Following the performance, Carey premiered the studio version on May 19 on The Russ Parr Morning Show radio show. A solo version which omits Wale's rap verses was later released in June 2014. The song was serviced to urban contemporary radio on June 30, 2014 and rhythmic contemporary radio on July 1, 2014, as the fourth single to be released from the album. When Carey released You Don't Know What to Do as the fourth single from the album, fans noticed that its accompanying single artwork looked odd. It was later revealed that the single artwork was a cropped version of the album cover for Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, whereby her head had been swapped for another image in favor of one which was forward facing, as well as an edited background. Various media outlets criticized Carey for continuing to heavily airbrush and recycle images of herself. In response, Carey expressed her discontent on Twitter, stating she had nothing to do with the selection of the single's artwork and in turn asked for fans to send in their artwork designs as alternatives, ending the message with 'cause at this point IDKWTD , an abbreviation of the song's title. You Don't Know What to Do is a disco revival song with elements of gospel, pop and R B styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as following in the recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about how she is in a dilemma as to whether or not she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single Good Times . Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared You Don't Know What to Do to Carey's previous singles Fantasy 1995 and Heartbreaker 1999 , but noted that it felt like a logical extension of post Pharrell disco revivalism . Christina Lee for Idolator thought that the 70s disco feel embodied Daft Punk's 2013 single, Get Lucky . PopMatters writer Devone Jones described the song as the most energetic track on the album, and continued to write that the skillful lyrics allow Carey to perform genuine harmonies which are reminiscent of seventies dance songs. Both Andy Kellman of AllMusic and Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine noted that Carey appeared to be channeling American dance singer Jocelyn Brown, with the former writer that she sounded like Brown more prominently in the intro, while the latter described You Don't Know What to Do as a stunning tribute to Brown's 1984 single Somebody Else's Guy . Henderson continued to write that You Don't Know What to Do , along with another album track called Meteorite , are two of Carey's most serious minded performances on the album, further describing them as galaxies away from her 2008 single I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time . Billboard writer Kenneth Partridge complimented the song for its dance appeal, adding that the only thing missing was a cameo from Nile Rodgers. Melinda Newman of HitFix praised the song's playful sentiment, writing that it was the best song that had been released from Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse so far. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz complimented the interpolation of I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair , describing it as nostalgic , and further stated that Carey embodies the bravado of American singer Jennifer Holliday in the broadway musical Dreamgirls. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner praised Dupri for producing a piano disco stormer with throwback appeal. Mike Wass of Idolator thought that You Don't Know What to Do would have been worthy of being recorded by American disco singer Donna Summer. Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its composition and noted that the disco and gospel genres are where middle aged woman can thrive , whereby Carey fits in unsurprisingly well . He was, however, critical of the decision to include Wale on the song. Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required. Conversely, fashion designer Donatella Versace, a friend of Carey's, told Vogue that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as poetry , and that it made her want to get up and dance all summer .

An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album Greatest Hits My Prerogative 2004 . Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented, the alternate audio gives the feel of Spears singing the song as a round, where the beat is in sync but one layer of her vocals is just slightly ahead of the other. Britney performed the song for the very first time at her The Hair Zone Mall Tour promotional mini tour in New York City, USA on July 1, 1998. As part of promotion for You Drive Me Crazy 's release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards.

They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of ...Baby One More Time . She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform You Drive Me Crazy , which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's Miss You Much music video that ended with Spears saying Is that the end , quoting Jackson's phrase from the video. The song was once again performed in a dance oriented form on the Oops ... I Did It Again World Tour 2000 , while in 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour, the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers.

"You Have 0 Friends is the fourth episode of the 14th season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 199th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 7, 2010. In the episode, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny make Stan a Facebook profile against his will and he becomes extremely frustrated with everyone asking him for friend requests. After he gets fed up with Facebook, Stan tries to delete his profile but is sucked into a virtual Facebook world. Meanwhile, Kyle starts trying to find ways to get more friends on Facebook after he drastically starts losing them due to his befriending of a third grade friendless Facebook user, whom everyone considers a loser. The episode was written and directed by co creator Trey Parker and was rated TV MA L in the United States. You Have 0 Friends features several references to the popular social networking service Facebook, and Stan's plotline parodies the 1982 Disney film Tron with Stan in the role of Kevin Flynn, and its climax borrows from the climax of the 2009 film Summer Wars. The episode also parodies the CNBC series Mad Money, as well as the online chat website Chatroulette, and the social network game FarmVille. You Have 0 Friends has received positive reviews from critics, and according to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by 3.071 million viewers and became the cable lead in the 1849 Wednesday night. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny surprise Stan by creating a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy anagram Dorky Drip to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, in part due to a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most of the people on the site are online predators either masturbating or flashing their genitals , until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight. Meanwhile, Stan now has 845,323 friends almost all of whom he hardly knows or does not know, despite the fact that this is actually impossible to do for real, since Facebook only allows a maximum of 5,000 friends per profile on his account and has finally decided to delete it, only to find that Facebook refuses to allow him to. Instead of deleting his account, Stan is forcibly transported by the software into the virtual world of Facebook, where he meets profiles of everyone he knows who communicate in Facebook lingo, and is forced to engage in Facebook activities such as Yahtzee. Unexpectedly winning on the first roll, Stan escapes and finds his way to Kyle's Farm Town farm, blaming Kyle for getting him sucked into Facebook in the first place. Stan orders Kyle to check out his profile status and Kyle finds out that Stan is supposedly hosting a party elsewhere in Facebook at Cafe World. Kyle makes it to Stan's party, only to find that Isiah has refused to be his friend because of Kip. Desperate to retain some friends, Kyle finally deletes Kip, leaving him with no friends. Kip, too, is disheartened to find his friend has abandoned him. At the party, Stan encounters his online profile, which has the form of a huge monstrous version of himself. It challenges him to a game of Yahtzee and Stan wins, again on the first roll, causing the profile to be finally deleted. The victory returns Stan to the real world once more. He now has no Facebook friends, and Randy, upon realizing that Stan is no longer his friend, asks Stan why he deleted him. Stan explains what just happened to him and that he has sent all his friends somewhere else . Back at Kip's house, Kip is still depressed about Kyle deleting him as a friend, but is then overjoyed when all 845,323 friends Stan had prior to deletion are suddenly transferred to his account as friends. You Have 0 Friends was written and directed by co series creator Trey Parker. He came up with the episode after signing up for Facebook and actually being sucked into it until people were angry that he did not respond to anyone on Facebook. He came up with the idea of doing something similar to Tron. The episode prominently features several aspects of the online website Facebook, including the Facebook games Farmville, Cafe World and a digital version of the Milton Bradley game Yahtzee. Also, many aspects of the virtual Facebook world Stan gets sucked into in the episode parody the film Tron. Stan's Facebook account is based on the Master Control Program. Cartman's podcast, Mad Friends, is a parody of a segment from the financial show Mad Money hosted by Jim Cramer on CNBC. You Have 0 Friends originally aired on April 7, 2010, with a TV MA rating in the United States, on Comedy Central. In its original American broadcast, it was watched by 3.071 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. This made it the second most viewed cable show of the night after In Plain Sight and attracting more viewers than the previous episode, Medicinal Fried Chicken . The episode also received an 1849 rating of 1.7 and a share of 5 edging out Tyler Perry's House of Payne for the cable lead in the demographic. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. The Indiana Daily Student's Brian Welk called the episode fairly enjoyable, joking that his Facebook status would say that he hopes the 200th episode is as good as the Facebook one Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said The half hour was shrewdly precise in its targets The older audience that communes on Facebook such as parents and grandparents as well as lonely kids as usual, South Park is merciless when it smells a baby boomer adopted trend. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 9 10, calling it brilliant from beginning to end, and one of the best episodes the series has served up in a while. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine wrote that You have 0 Friends has the right amount of humor, intelligence, and sarcasm to match any South Park episode. The question is, does it become an instant classic Cristina Everett of the New York Daily News called the episode hilarious, yet heartwarming , adding that the Kip Drordy subplot was endearing . There have been less favorable reviews of You Have 0 Friends that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3 5, said there was too much Facebook in the episode and that it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more LOL moments . Grading it a D , The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff opined the episode mostly made all of the jokes about that the rest of us did back when Facebook first invaded all of our lives. It doesn't give me high hopes for the inevitable Twitter episode the show does in 2013. You Have 0 Friends , along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three disc DVD set and two disc Blu ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Have%200%20Friends

"You Know My Name , performed by Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, it is the theme song to the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale. Cornell wrote it jointly with David Arnold, the soundtrack's composer. The film producers chose Cornell because they wanted a strong male singer. Cornell and Arnold tried to make the song a replacement theme for the character instead of the James Bond theme reflecting the agent's inexperience in Casino Royale, as well as an introduction to Daniel Craig's grittier and more emotional portrayal of Bond. The single sold 148,000 copies in 2006 in the UK, peaked at number 7 in the UK singles chart, and has sold 323,000 digital copies and 3.5 million streams in the U.S. as of 2017. The track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20, 2006, and released as a single on November 13, 2006, charting in many countries. Reviews for You Know My Name were positive, and the song won the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. While not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack, You Know My Name appeared on Cornell's second solo album, Carry On. Lia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell inviting him to make a song for the new Bond movie, which would reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond , with a strong male singer . Cornell thought it was a strange offer, considering that he is American, and imagined that he would perform a secondary song in the film instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies . But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued the musician, and he decided to accept the job. Cornell then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting, and was much impressed with the film's emotional content after he was shown a rough cut of Casino Royale. In Prague he also met the score composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song that echoed the film score . The composers started their writing separately, Cornell in his apartment in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around for about a month not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier. Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song. Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape . After a demo of the song was approved by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums. The recordings were finished by the time Casino Royale finished its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed in the orchestra parts. Speaking to film music fan site Maintitles, Arnold said he wanted You Know My Name to act as a substitute for the James Bond theme, to represent Bond's immaturity. The song's main notes are played throughout the film, and the classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc. Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score, and have the DNA of the James Bond music . The musical arrangement tried to create the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation , with Cornell describing it as more uptempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been, maybe since Paul McCartney 's 'Live and Let Die' . Chris Cornell Cornell stated that the biggest two influences on You Know My Name were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice, Cornell said. And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I wanted to write a song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again a big orchestra so I wanted to have fun with it. Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth . And he jokingly stated Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun . Before producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on July 26, 2006, that Cornell was performing the theme for Casino Royale, various names were reported in the media, some reports going so far as to have the performers apparently claim they were working on the song. This list includes Tina Turner, who previously sang GoldenEye for the 1995 Bond film of the same name, and Tony Christie. The lyrics try to illustrate Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy of the previous incarnations. Cornell tried to focus on the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents There's an isolation in that the stakes are very high. I've done a lot of living in my 42 years, and it wasn't hard for me to relate to that. The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before hence the title You Know My Name dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, introducing himself to what may be the rest of his life and how he will live it and what it will mean. Three versions of the song were produced The song was leaked on the internet on September 20, 2006. The first version of the song, the grittier one which was leaked and not used in the movie, was made available for download on iTunes Store on November 13, 2006. This version debuted on the UK Single Download Chart at number 20 on November 22, 2006. It was released as a stand alone single on December 14, 2006. The single features a new acoustic version of the Soundgarden song Black Hole Sun as a B side. The German, Dutch and Australian versions of the single offer a second version of You Know My Name called the Pop Mix as a B side. This version is the one used for the song's music video, and is available on Chris Cornell's solo album, Carry On. The orchestral version featured in the opening titles of the film has not been commercially released. The song is the first Bond theme not to be included on its film's soundtrack album. Cornell declared that it happened because he wanted the song to be his , and since he wrote You Know My Name in midst of recording the solo album Carry On, he felt that the song belonged to the album. In 2008, the song was included in the compilation The Best of Bond...James Bond. The song's music video was directed by Michael Haussman, who tried to compare the lives of a professional spy and a rock star . The video premiered on MTV's Making the Video on October 31, 2006. You Know My Name was released in the winter of 2006 and became the most successful song from Chris Cornell on the rock charts and arguably Cornell's most recognizable and popular song. The song peaked at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 64 on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. In Europe, You Know My Name charted in several markets and peaked at number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. Chris Cornell won both the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award for You Know My Name in 2007, and garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media the following year. The song also received a first round nomination in the Best Original Song category for the 2006 Academy Awards, but did not qualify for the final list of nominees. The song received enthusiastic reviews, with critics praising the song's ability to fit well with the context of the film. Film reviewer James Berardinelli considered You Know My Name to sound eerily like something by John Barry DVD Verdict's review praised the song, describing it as working remarkably well in the film's context, lyrically and sonically , and Cinefantastique called it the best Bond theme song in years, captures the full blooded glory of classics like 'Goldfinger' . Entertainment Weekly listed You Know My Name on a list of Academy Award snubs for Best Song, describing it as a musically suave, lyrically ominous rock tune that is perfect for Casino Royale's dark reboot of the spy franchise . Among music critics, Billboard described it as the best Bond theme since 'A View to a Kill' , praising the minimal production on its review of Carry On, the magazine considered You Know My Name to be the best track of the album, describing it as some of Cornell's most uncomplicated and accessible music to date the BBC's unnamed reviewer considered that Cornell's voice weighs down the song 1 2",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Know%20My%20Name
"You Know What You Did is the first episode of the third season of The Hills. It originally aired on MTV on August 13, 2007. In the episode, Lauren Conrad ends her friendship with former housemate Heidi Montag after suspecting that Heidi and her boyfriend Spencer Pratt fabricated rumors of a sex tape involving Lauren and her ex boyfriend Jason Wahler. The ensuing feud between the women becomes a central focus of the series, and is carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appears. You Know What You Did was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Sara Mast, Andrew Perry, Jason Sands, Robyn Schnieders, Sean Travis, Michael Spike Van Briesen, and Rick Van Meter. The episode was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who felt that the changed dynamic between Conrad and Montag was entertaining for television. It was additionally notable for Conrad's delivery of the titular line You know what you did when speaking to Montag, which has since been recognized as an iconic moment from the series. According to Nielsen ratings, You Know What You Did was watched by 3.6 million viewers in its original airing. The episode was released on DVD on July 19, 2008, packaged with the third season set. The third season of The Hills begins with Whitney Port becoming Lauren's boss, after being promoted within Teen Vogue. On their first day returning to work, Lauren informs Whitney of false speculation regarding a sex tape involving herself and her ex boyfriend Jason Wahler. Lauren comments that she has not spoken with Heidi since she moved into an apartment with Spencer, and the women become suspicious of her possible involvement with the rumors. Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are planning their housewarming party Spencer plans on inviting several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on inviting Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren. Audrina accepts the invitations, although later tells her co worker that she believes that Heidi and Spencer were speaking badly of Lauren and were responsible for spreading the sex tape rumors. Lauren and Whitney decline their invitations to the housewarming party, and instead plan an impromptu outing at the club Les Deux. Meanwhile, during the housewarming party, Jenn Bunney makes a brief appearance at the apartment, although Heidi is disappointed after realizing that Lauren will not be attending. Unaware that they will run into Heidi and Spencer, Lauren and Audrina attend a birthday party for their friend Frankie Delgado the following day. As Lauren leaves for the bathroom after Heidi gives her a letter, Heidi tells Audrina that she is unsure of the reason for the tension between them. Audrina finds Lauren in the bathroom and they read the letter together, which details Heidi's interest in rekindling their friendship. Angered that Heidi will not acknowledge the sex tape rumors, Lauren decides to exit the club. At the recommendation of Spencer, Heidi confronts Lauren before she is able to leave the club. Lauren and Audrina get into an argument with Heidi and Spencer outside of Les Deux, where Lauren delivers the now famous quote You know what you did , elaborating that You started a sick little rumor about me You're a sad, pathetic person. The following morning, Heidi explains to her co worker Elodie Otto that she was unaware of said speculation, and still wants to reconcile with Lauren. Meanwhile, Lauren tells Whitney that she is saddened by the idea of losing her friend, although admits that she has benefited from their separation. You Know What You Did was produced by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Sara Mast, Andrew Perry, Jason Sands, Robyn Schnieders, Sean Travis, Michael Spike Van Briesen, and Rick Van Meter. Rumors of a sex tape involving Conrad and Wahler, in addition to stories alleging that she invaded his house to retrieve it, surfaced in April 2007. Conrad adamantly denied both reports, commenting that if I ever tried to get something back from Jason, it was probably just photo albums and stuff and the producers videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know The president of entertainment for MTV, Brian Graden, commented that the series benefits from the media coverage it receives in between seasons, which he described as a six month commercial for the show that doesn't five away the narrative in full. He elaborated that MTV wants viewers to watch Lauren and the girls as the characters we know instead of in a show about being the stars of The Hills the sex tape rumors were consequently presented like a personal conflict between the women, and was intentionally not addressed as a highly publicized controversy. The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag received extensive media attention since its beginning Conrad was doubtful of the possibility of a reconciliation, noting that I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don't think we would ever go back to being best friends. When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything I would try not to. In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating it wasn't so much about the filming, but I didn't want to do a show with the other people on it , which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt. You Know What You Did was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, who felt that the changed dynamic between Conrad and Montag was entertaining for television. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jennifer Armstrong provided a favorable review she opined that the conflict between Conrad and Montag made for the most mature season ever and offered a disclaimer that the term maturity was being relative here, of course. A writer for The Hollywood Gossip stated that the episode didn't disappoint , and felt that the storyline clearly categorized Patridge and Port as being part of Team Lauren and Pratt as being part of Team Heidi in the epic war . Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times felt that the deterioration of Conrad and Montag's friendship was more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because as anyone who has ever been a young woman knows undying friendships die. Writing for Los Angeles Times, Denise Martin was complimentary of the fact that the conflict was unsullied despite the extensive media coverage it received before the season began, and added that it was better than anything you'd get on All My Children. Furthermore, Conrad's delivery of the titular line You know what you did when speaking to Montag has been recognized as an iconic moment from the series the staff from Us Weekly ranked the scene as the most memorable event from the program when recapping highlights from its six seasons in July 2010. In its original broadcast in the United States on August 13, 2007, You Know What You Did was watched by 3.6 million viewers.

In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, She was just excited to get to work with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle America kind of person. But she's a little hipster. You go back to her house and sit by the fire with some wine, and what's playing over the sound system The Knife and Arthur Russell. She doesn't listen to pop music . In the standard edition of Bionic, the couple co wrote three tracks, including You Lost Me . The song was described as the heart of the album by Aguilera. According to the Herald Sun, Aguilera wanted to collaborated more with Furler for the album.

Hinshaw Drew of The Village Voice labelled it the un bionic moment on the record . Lyrically, You Lost Me talks about a cheating man, who has left Aguilera's world infected . Amar Toor from AOL Radio thought that its lyrical content perfectly captures one of the most difficult experiences young lovers have to go through . The song begins with a somber orchestral piano opening, followed by the lines I am done, smoking gun We've lost it all, the love is gone sung by Aguilera. During the chorus, she sings, I feel like our world's been infected And somehow you left me neglected . Toward the ending, Aguilera's painful and catharsis voice crescendos dramatically .

Mesfin Fekadu of Northwest Herald thought that the emotional song shows off the diva's powerful voice , while Drew Hinshaw from The Village Voice deemed You Lost Me as the most vulnerable song from Bionic. Michael Cragg, writing for musicOMH, wrote that the ballads co written by Furler make Bionic the first Aguilera album where the ballads aren't ruined by her tendency to cover all the notes on the scale . Her further compared You Lost Me to Aguilera's previous hit Beautiful 2002 . Digital Spy editor Robert Cospey gave the song three stars out of five, praising her vocals yet thinking that the song somehow lacks the sincerity as she displayed on Hurt and Oh Mother .

"You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives is the 25th episode of the fourth season of Family Guy. The episode originally aired on April 30, 2006, on Fox. In the episode, Brian's gay cousin Jasper comes to Quahog with his boyfriend Ricardo to get married. Mayor West tries to ban same sex marriage to divert attention from a bad investment he made with the taxpayers' money. Brian fights for gay marriage and ends up taking Mayor West hostage to get his view across. The episode was written by David A. Goodman and directed by Dominic Polcino. The episode received polarized reviews from critics. The week it aired, the episode had an estimated 7.8 million viewers. The episode features guest performances from Michael Clarke Duncan, Ralph Garman, Rachael MacFarlane, Chad Morgan, Charles Reid, Craig Reid, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Stark Sands, as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. Brians gay cousin Jasper comes to Quahog with his Filipino boyfriend Ricardo, and announces that they are going to get married. Everyone is delighted except for Lois, who is against same sex marriage. Later, Mayor Adam West reveals in the city center a solid gold statue of the Honey Smacks mascot Dig 'Em, and dedicates the statue to the servicemen who died in what he refers to as the recent Gulf conflict . The cost of the statue puts the city in debt. In order to distract the townspeople, he proposes a bill outlawing same sex marriage. Meanwhile, Chris falls for Alyssa, a beautiful girl who belongs to the Young Republicans, and joins the group to impress her. An enraged Brian vows to make West change his mind, getting 10,000 people to sign a petition to oppose the bill. Lois refuses to sign and takes Stewie to visit her parents. Before Brian can present the petition to the mayor, Chris burns it because Alyssa has agreed he may touch her breasts if he destroys the document, much to Brian's anger. Brian manages to get 10,000 more signatures on a new petition to show it to Mayor West, but West still won't change his mind. Out of desperation, Brian takes a security guards gun, and holds the mayor hostage. Lois hears about Brian on TV, and then discovers that her parents do not love each other, and even raised her to believe that a heterosexual couple who hate each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other have the right to be together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house. Written by David A. Goodman, and directed by Dominic Polcino, series creator Seth MacFarlane came up with the idea for the episode while writing a pilot episode featuring two gay men. MacFarlane describes himself as incredibly passionate about support for the gay community , and finds it to be infuriating and idiotic that two gay partners have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two ' In addition to the regular cast, actor Michael Clarke Duncan, voice actor Ralph Garman, actress Rachael MacFarlane, actress Chad Morgan, actor Charles Reid, actor Craig Reid, voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, and voice actor Stark Sands guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voices include Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, Johnny Brennan, writer Mike Henry, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer John Viener, and actor Adam West, who portrays an exaggerated version of himself. Actor Patrick Warburton has a guest appearance as well. Censor issues required multiple changes to the episode. The line when Peter says, It's not like we're going to have a gay sex orgy in the living room, was originally, Come on Lois, we're not going to drill glory holes in the living room. The show received a broadcast standards request that the anti gay video the priest shows Lois say Pat Robertson Industries, so as not to make it look like Fox had an opinion about homosexuals. The writers had a problem with Lois being against gay marriage, as they felt they were not portraying her in a way that is consistent with other episodes as she expressed a more liberal viewpoint on many past issues on the show and even expressed a generally more accepting view of gays in the episode Brian Sings and Swings. The DVD version has a deleted scene during the backyard wedding ending where Ricardo who doesn't speak English asks Stewie what's going on and Stewie who speaks Tagalog tells Ricardo that he'll find out on his wedding night. Mayor West builds a statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot, which causes controversy and causes West to ban gay marriage. Stewie takes over air traffic control, and causes Matthew McConaughey's private plane to crash into the ocean. The film, The Sound of Music, is also referenced in the episode. West also swallowed a Stratego board game and an older issue of People magazine which features the actor Paul Hogan. A cutaway gag involves Peter in the band The Proclaimers, in a recording for the song I'm Gonna Be 500 Miles , while another involves Popeye at Dr.Hartman's office, where he is told his bulging forearms are full of tumors and his speech patterns are the result of a stroke. You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives had an average of 7.82 million viewers and ranked 82nd out of 215 programs airing that week. Bob Sassone from TV Squad wrote that he could not stop laughing throughout the episode, feeling that there is just something really funny about gay dogs getting married and a giant gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot . While reviewing the Family Guy Volume 4 DVD, Nancy Basile of About.com called the episode sharp .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20May%20Now%20Kiss%20the...%20Uh...%20Guy%20Who%20Receives
"You Must Love Me is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical, Evita, based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Peron. The song was released on October 27, 1996, by Warner Bros. as the lead single from the film's soundtrack. After years of not working together due to their individual projects, Webber and Rice collaborated on creating a new track for the film, with the hopes of obtaining an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. According to Webber, the song's purpose was to showcase Peron's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Peron. Madonna, who starred in the title role of the film, had tried to change the lyrics of the track to create a sympathetic portrayal of Peron, but was unsuccessful. She also undertook vocal lessons to record the songs for the film. You Must Love Me features instrumentation from cello and piano which accompanies Madonna's vocals. The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting Madonna's enhanced singing ability. It went on to win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997. Commercially, You Must Love Me became a top 10 hit in some countries including Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom, while reaching the top 20 in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA for shipments of 500,000 physical units. A music video, directed by Alan Parker, was released as promotion for the single. Madonna has performed the song at the 69th Academy Awards and on her 200809 Sticky Sweet Tour. In 1996, Madonna starred in the film Evita, playing the role of Eva Peron, the Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Peron and even wrote a letter to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had. You Must Love Me was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who had reunited for Evita after a ten year creative separation due to their individual projects. It was written specifically for the film, so that it would contain new material and be eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Madonna noted it as her favorite song from the film, recalling that the idea for You Must Love Me grew when Parker re arranged the ending of the film from the original play, with the hopes of reuniting Rice and Webber to create new music. According to Webber, the purpose of the song was to showcase Peron's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Peron is dying and she knows she's dying. One reason she is saying, 'You must love me', is out of desperation. She's also saying, 'You must love me because you must have always loved me', so it's a little word play, I guess, which Tim Rice has written , he explained. It was released as the soundtrack's first official single on October 27, 1996. Since its release, the song has been included in several productions of the play, including the 2006 London production and the 2012 Broadway revival. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and took place at the CTS Studios in London Madonna was accompanied by her co stars Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a guide vocal simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't ... To work on forty six songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment , she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording. You Must Love Me starts with the sound of orchestra and piano, as Madonna sings the opening verses. She continues singing the lyrics, which talk about Peron's discovery that her husband Juan had actually loved her all along and not merely seen her as a political prop. Madonna disliked the lyrics since she wanted to portray Peron as a sympathetic figure, rather than the shrewd manipulator that Parker had in mind. She was also concerned about her own image, and was successful in getting many portions of the script altered. However, Rice declined to change the song's lyrics, but rewrote its instrumentation five or six times. He recalled, I remember taking the lyrics to Madonna and she was trying to change them... The scene can be interpreted in different ways, but my lyrics were kept, thank God Other instrumentation for the song includes cello, which was played by a live orchestra. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say, Scared to confess what I'm feeling, Frightened you'll slip away , when the piano and the orchestra sounds come back again. It proceeds in the same way and gradually fades out. You Must Love Me is set in common time, with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from G3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of BE BF BB in the beginning and changes to BF when Madonna sings the opening verse Where do we go from here . You Must Love Me received generally positive reviews from critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna An Intimate Biography, wrote Who can deny that her voice has remarkable and unmistakable presence when heard during 'You Must Love Me' . Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna Like an Icon, appreciated the song's addition to the soundtrack and found pathos in Madonna's vocals. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that Even with the faults, Evita has its merits, including the written for film ballad 'You Must Love Me' . Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, wrote that 'You Must Love Me' is an aching farewell that dispels the illusion of a romance of convenience to reveal the inescapable love and tragedy beneath . Teresa Huang from The Tech, said it was a beautiful addition to an already powerful score . Larry Flick, from Billboard, called it a momentous musical event ... a bittersweet and quietly theatrical ballad specifically for Madonna . Kathleen Guerdo, also from Billboard, said that delivers what is by far one of the strongest vocal performances of her career, comfortably scaling to the song's demanding soprano heights while infusing it with delicate, heart rending emotion. This bodes well for the creative potency of the rest of the soundtrack . Matthew Jacobs from HuffPost, placed it at number 61 of his list The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles . He explained that he vocal training Madonna endured for the movie pays off in this soprano serenade , but also noted that it doesn't do much outside of the film . Similar thoughts were shared by Medium's Richard LaBeau. Spin's Annie Zaleski noted that Madonna's performances on the Evita soundtrack demonstrated her astronomical growth as a vocalist , citing her fragile sounding pleas on the Oscar winning 'You Must Love Me' as an example. J. D. Considine, from The Baltimore Sun, said it was one of the big songs from the soundtrack. On her review of Evita, Janet Maslin from The New York Times commented that Mr. Lloyd Webber and Mr. Rice have contributed a lilting new song, 'You Must Love Me', that's as suitable for weddings as it is for running South American countries . Entertainment Weekly's David Browne gave the song a rating of B and opined that 'You Must Love Me' is no 'Live to Tell' or 'Take a Bow'. But this simple, elegantly arranged showpiece from Evita is clearly intended to promote both the film and her new adult, matriarchal image . Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune, called it among the composers' finest works a rare example of understatement with its sparse instrumentation, brevity and nuanced lyricism . Peter Travers from Rolling Stone called it sympathy begging . The song won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 54th ceremony, which took place on January 19, 1997. Two months later, it was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 69th Academy Awards. While ranking Madonna's singles, in honor of her 60th birthday, The Guardian's Jude Rogers placed You Must Love Me at number 50, calling it the singer's best performance from the film and pointing out the emotional quaking desperation in her voice. Negative criticism came from the San Francisco Chronicle's Barbara Shulgasser, who wrote that 'You Must Love Me' didn't help a bit. Rice writes lazy, dumb lyrics that make no effort to correspond to the rhythms of the music . Also negative was Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson, who wrote that it just barely misses taking the dishonor of being ranked the worst of the singles released from the soundtrack, it certainly chides that its entire mad existence was to push Andrew Lloyd Webber to an EGOT . In the United States, You Must Love Me was serviced to radio on October 9, 1996. It was met with a positive response, garnering 118 plays the first week, and debuting at number 55 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The CD single was released on October 29, following public demands about the song Rainbow High from the film was added as its B side. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 22 the week of November 14, 1996, ultimately peaking at number 18 after two weeks. It ranked at number 99 on the year end chart for 1997. According to Billboard, You Must Love Me was Madonna's fourth highest debuting single of her career, following You'll See number 8 in 1995 , Erotica number 13 in 1992 and Rescue Me number 15 in 1991 . It was also the highest charting Webber Rice collaboration since Helen Reddy's rendition of I Don't Know How to Love Him , which reached number 13 in 1971. It eventually received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA on October 22, 1998, for shipments of 500,000 copies. In Canada, the song debuted at number 36 on the RPM Top Singles chart, and reached a peak of number 11 on the week of December 16, 1996. It was present for a total of 14 weeks on the chart. In the United Kingdom, the song reached a peak of number 10 on the UK Singles Chart the week of November 2, 1996, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 9 weeks. According to the Official Charts Company, the song had sold 90,428 copies by August 2008 in there. In Australia, You Must Love Me peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of November 10, 1996, staying on this position for one week and a total of 9 weeks on the chart. In Italy, it reached the fourth position of the Hit Parade Chart. On the year end Italian charts, it was ranked at number 39. You Must Love Me reached a peak of number 4 in Finland, and also reached a peak of number 21 on the Irish Singles Chart, where it remained for 2 weeks. In Germany, it became one of Madonna's lowest charting singles, peaking at number 78. The music video for You Must Love Me was directed by Parker and features the singer performing the song inside a small room interspersed with footage and scenes from Evita. As Madonna was eight months pregnant with her daughter Lourdes Maria, her stomach remained hidden behind a piano. The music video was included as a bonus feature on the 15th Anniversary Edition blu ray of the film, released on June 19, 2012. On March 24, 1997, Madonna performed the song at the 69th Academy Awards dressed in a full length, strapless Christian Dior gown. According to choreographer Otis Sallid, they wanted to portray the singer in a restrained manner, hence the accompaniment in the stage was just a spotlight on her and a piano to her left. Writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, movie critic Carrie Rickey felt Madonna gave a restrained performance of the number . Madonna did not perform the song again until her Sticky Sweet Tour 20082009 . She appeared on stage wearing a black Givenchy dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck and black stockings on her legs and performed an acoustic, guitar driven version of the song sitting on a stool. She was backed by 4 musicians who were dressed in gypsy clothes. As she performed the song, scenes from Evita played on the backdrop screens. The performance received positive feedback from critics with Ricardo Baca, from The Denver Post, writing that her courageous, late set take on 'You Must Love Me' from the filmed version of the Broadway musical Evita was spot on and gorgeous with its string accompaniment . On the Buenos Aires stop of the tour, after performing You Must Love Me , Madonna also sang Don't Cry for Me Argentina from the film. The performances of both songs in the city were recorded in the live CD DVD titled, Sticky Sweet Tour 2010 . In 2007, singer Brooke White covered the song on the seventh season of American Idol. She initially forgot the lyrics to the song, so had to stop after the first verse to start over from the beginning. Lana Del Rey recorded a cover of You Must Love Me in 2018 for Webber's greatest hits album Unmasked The Platinum Collection. Del Rey commented Andrew Lloyd Webber has been one of my primary inspirations in music, so to do a cover of one of his songs is a dream. I especially love...'You Must Love Me', because of how unique the melody is. I've been incredibly inspired by all of Andrews work from Phantom of the Opera to Evita.

"You Never Give Me Your Money is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. It was written by Paul McCartney though credited to LennonMcCartney and documented the financial and personal difficulties facing the band. The song is the first part of the medley on side two of their 1969 album Abbey Road and was recorded in stages between May and August that year. The song was the first one to be recorded for the medley, which was conceived by McCartney and producer George Martin as a finale for the Beatles' career. The backing track was recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, London, but the remainder of overdubs occurred at EMI Studios. Musically, the song is made up of a suite of various segments, ranging from a piano ballad at the beginning through to guitar arpeggios at the end. The song was written by McCartney when he was staying with his wife Linda in New York in March 1969 shortly after their marriage. This was a break following the Get Back Let It Be sessions. John Lennon and McCartney were at risk of losing overall control of Northern Songs, the company that published their songs, after ATV Music bought a majority share. McCartney had been largely responsible for the group's direction and projects since the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, but began to realise that the group dynamic of the Beatles was coming to an end. He was particularly unhappy at the others wanting to draft in manager Allen Klein to help sort out their finances. McCartney later said that the song was written with Klein in mind, saying it's basically a song about no faith in the person . He added that the line One sweet dream, pack up the bags, get in the limousine was based on his trips in the country with Linda to get away from the tense atmosphere with the Beatles, though author Walter Everett thought the line was also a nostalgic look at the Beatles' touring years, which had ended in 1966. The musical structure came from several song fragments, beginning with a piano ballad and moving to a number of different styles, including boogie woogie piano, arpeggiated guitars and nursery rhyme. Beatles author Ian MacDonald speculated that the guitar arpeggios at the end of the track were influenced by I Want You She's So Heavy and the middle section of Here Comes the Sun , and the overall structure was inspired by Lennon's Happiness Is a Warm Gun from the previous year's The Beatles, which also joined unrelated song fragments together. Realising that Abbey Road could be the group's last album, McCartney and Martin decided to combine various portions of tracks into a medley, which would act as a climactic finale of the group's career. McCartney later said that the idea of a song suite was inspired by Keith West's Excerpt from A Teenage Opera . Some musical segments of You Never Give Me Your Money were reused for the Golden Slumbers Carry That Weight portion of the medley, including the opening verses and later guitar arpeggios. The basic backing track was recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes on 6 May 1969. Recording started at 3pm and went on until 4am the next morning. McCartney sang lead and played piano, Lennon played an Epiphone Casino guitar, George Harrison played a Fender Telecaster guitar fed through a Leslie speaker, and Ringo Starr played drums. The group recorded 36 takes, selecting take 30 as the best, which was made into a rough stereo mix. The basic structure of the song as it appeared on Abbey Road had not been worked out at this stage, and the original recording ran onto a loose jam session, ending up as a fast rock and roll instrumental towards the end. The track was completed in EMI Studios. McCartney overdubbed a lead vocal onto the basic track on 1 July, and further vocals and sound effects were added on 15 July. On 30 July, a reduction mix was made of the original eight track tape, so further overdubs could be made, and a rough mix of the Abbey Road medley was put together. The cross fade from You Never Give Me Your Money into the next track, Sun King , proved to be problematic, and the group made several attempts before deciding to merge the songs via an organ note. McCartney completed the instrumental overdubs the next day, on 31 July, by adding a bass guitar part and additional piano overdubs, including some punched in honky tonk piano in place of the original. The final recording session occurred on 5 August, when McCartney made a number of tape loops at EMI Studios, including bells, birds, bubbles and chirping crickets. Martin mixed the track into stereo on 13 August, and made 11 attempts at a final mix, combining the tape loops with the cross fade into Sun King , replacing the earlier organ note. He made another attempt at a final mix on 21 August, and this was used for the finished master. According to Ian MacDonald The track has been used on some albums featuring Beatles' songs covered by other artists. In 2009, Nine Below Zero with Glenn Tilbrook covered the song on Abbey Road Now , a CD of Abbey Road covers accompanying the October 2009 issue of Mojo magazine.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Never%20Give%20Me%20Your%20Money
"You Only Live Twice is a 1967 spy film and the fifth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story. In the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit. With each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War, Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially unseen character. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers. During the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore. You Only Live Twice was a great success, receiving positive reviews and grossing over 111 million in worldwide box office. American NASA spacecraft Jupiter 16 is hijacked from orbit by an unidentified spaceship. The United States suspects it to be the work of the Soviets, but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft, after having swallowed Jupiter 16, landed in the Sea of Japan. To investigate, MI6 operative James Bond is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death in Hong Kong and being buried at sea from HMS Tenby. Upon his arrival, Bond attends a sumo match where he is approached by a woman who takes him to meet to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise, and is driven in the getaway car to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of the company's president, Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by the woman he had met earlier, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to the office of the head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, who reveals that the woman is his assistant Aki. The stolen documents are examined, and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship Ning Po, with a microdot message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution. While at Tanaka's spa, Bond meets with Aki again. Having developed feelings for each other, the pair kiss and Bond carries Aki to his bed. Bond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, masquerading as a potential new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting, he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to Kobe, where the Ning Po is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities, and discover that the ship was delivering elements for rocket fuel. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away however, Bond is captured. He wakes, tied up in SPECTRE operative Helga Brandt's cabin on the Ning Po. Brandt interrogates Bond, before she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him. Brandt flies Bond to Tokyo the next day, but en route, she sets off a flare in the plane, seals Bond in his seat and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to evade the trap, lands the plane and flees before it explodes. After finding out where the Ning Po unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed autogyro created by Q. Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by four helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon turns out that the true mastermind behind this is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the mysterious leader of SPECTRE who has been hired by a great power strongly implied to be the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet American war, in order for them to destroy each other so that China can replace them as the world's new superpower. Blofeld summons Osato and Brandt to his office to answer for not having killed Bond Osato immediately blames his assistant, Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her to her death into a pool filled with piranhas. Blofeld then orders Osato to kill Bond. Bond then meets Tanaka and Aki in Kyoto where they plan to infiltrate the island by disguising Bond as a Japanese fisherman. Aki's part in the mission comes to an end while in Kyoto when she dies after being accidentally poisoned by a SPECTRE assassin who had intended to target Bond while the pair slept together. Bond is then introduced to Tanaka's student, Kissy Suzuki, who is to act as his wife and who, with Aki now dead, Bond quickly turns his attentions towards. Acting on her lead, the pair reconnoitre a cave booby trapped with poison, and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to the secret rocket base, Bond slips in, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured American and Russian astronauts and, with their help, steals a space suit in an attempt to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft, Bird One . However, Blofeld spots Bond breaking astronaut rules, and he is detained while Bird One is launched Bond is taken into the control room where he meets Blofeld face to face for the first time. Bird One closes in on the American space capsule, and U.S. forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, the Japanese ninjas approach the base's entrance, but are detected and fired upon. Bond manages to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the ensuing battle, Bond fights his way back to the control room, kills Blofeld's bodyguard Hans by flipping his body into the piranha pool, and activates Bird One's self destruct before it reaches the American craft. The Americans promptly stand down their forces. Blofeld, who had earlier killed Osato to demonstrate the price of failure to Bond, activates the base's self destruct system, a bomb that triggers a volcanic eruption and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas leave before the eruption destroys the base, and are picked up by the Japanese Maritime Forces and the British Secret Service. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the intended next film, but the producers decided to adapt You Only Live Twice instead because OHMSS would require searching for high and snowy locations. Lewis Gilbert originally declined the offer to direct, but accepted after producer Albert R. Broccoli called him saying You can't give up this job. It's the largest audience in the world. Peter R. Hunt, who edited the first five Bond films, believed that Gilbert had been contracted by the producers for other work but they found they had to use him. Gilbert, producers Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, production designer Ken Adam and director of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. SPECTRE's shore fortress headquarters was changed to an extinct volcano after the team learned that the Japanese do not build castles by the sea. The group was due to return to the UK on a BOAC Boeing 707 flight BOAC Flight 911 on 5 March 1966, but cancelled after being told they had a chance to watch a ninja demonstration. That flight crashed 25 minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. In Tokyo, the crew also found Hunt, who decided to go on holiday after having his request to direct declined. Hunt was invited to direct the second unit for You Only Live Twice and accepted the job. Unlike most James Bond films featuring various locations around the world, almost the entire film is set in one country and several minutes are devoted to an elaborate Japanese wedding. This is in keeping with Fleming's original novel, which also devoted a number of pages to the discussion of Japanese culture. Toho Studios provided soundstages, personnel, and the female Japanese stars to the producers. The producers had Harold Jack Bloom come to Japan with them to write a screenplay. Bloom's work was ultimately rejected, but since several of his ideas were used in the final script, Bloom was given the credit of Additional Story Material . Among the elements were the opening with Bond's fake death and burial at sea, and the ninja attack. As the screenwriter of the previous Bond films, Richard Maibaum, was unavailable, Roald Dahl a close friend of Ian Fleming was chosen to write the adaptation, despite having no prior experience writing a screenplay except for the uncompleted The Bells of Hell Go Ting a ling a ling. Dahl said that the original novel was Fleming's worst book, with no plot in it which would even make a movie , and compared it to a travelogue, stating that he had to create a new plot I could retain only four or five of the original story's ideas. On creating the plot, Dahl said he did not know what the hell Bond was going to do despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks, and decided to do a basic plot similar to Dr. No. Dahl was given a free rein on his script, except for the character of Bond and the girl formula , involving three women for Bond to seduce an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed, and the main Bond girl. While the third involved a character from the book, Kissy Suzuki, Dahl had to create Aki and Helga Brandt to fulfil the rest. Gilbert was mostly collaborative with Dahl's work, as the writer declared He not only helped in script conferences, but had some good ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct You either trust your writer or you don't. Charles Gray, who played Dikko Henderson, actually says the famous shaken not stirred line the other way round saying that is stirred not shaken, that was right wasn't it Bond replies Perfect. When the time came to begin You Only Live Twice, the producers were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment time spent filming and publicising each movie , together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement. Jan Werich was originally cast by producer Harry Saltzman to play Blofeld. Upon his arrival at the Pinewood set, both producer Albert R. Broccoli and director Lewis Gilbert felt that he was a poor choice, resembling a poor, benevolent father Christmas . Nonetheless, in an attempt to make the casting work, Gilbert continued filming. After several days, both Gilbert and Broccoli determined that Werich was not menacing enough, and recast Blofeld with Donald Pleasence in the role. Pleasence's ideas for Blofeld's appearance included a hump, a limp, a beard, and a lame hand, before he settled on the scar. He found it uncomfortable, though, because of the glue that attached it to his eye. Many European models were tested for Helga Brandt including German actress Eva Renzi who passed on the film, with German actress Karin Dor being cast. Dor performed the stunt of diving into a pool to depict Helga's demise, without the use of a double. Strangely, for the German version, Dor was dubbed by somebody else. Gilbert had chosen Tetsuro Tamba after working with him in The 7th Dawn. A number of martial arts experts were hired as the ninjas. The two Japanese female parts proved difficult to cast, due to most of the actresses tested having limited English. Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama were eventually chosen and started taking English classes in the UK. Hama, initially cast in the role of Tanaka's assistant, had difficulty with the language, so the producers switched her role with Wakabayashi, who had been cast as Kissy, a part with significantly less dialogue. Wakabayashi only requested that her character name, Suki , be changed to Aki . Filming of You Only Live Twice lasted from July 1966 to March 1967. The film was shot primarily in Japan and most of the locations are identifiable. In summary Most of the interiors were shot at Pinewood. The opening sequence in Hong Kong used some location footage of a street in Kowloon. Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour is also shown but the at sea burial of Bond and the retrieval of the corpse was filmed off Gibraltar and the Bahamas. The scenes with the light aircraft ferrying Bond to his supposed death were shot over a very English looking, Buckinghamshire countryside whereas this was supposed to be Japan. Large crowds were present in Japan to see the shooting. A Japanese fan began following Sean Connery with a camera, and the police were called several times to prevent invasions during shooting. The heavily armed WA 116 autogyro Little Nellie was included after Ken Adam heard a radio interview with its inventor, RAF Wing Commander Ken Wallis. Little Nellie was named after music hall star Nellie Wallace, who has a similar surname to its inventor. Wallis piloted his invention, which was equipped with various mock up armaments by John Stears' special effects team, during production. Nellie's battle with helicopters proved to be difficult to film. The scenes were initially shot in Miyazaki, first with takes of the gyrocopter, with more than 85 take offs, 5 hours of flight and Wallis nearly crashing into the camera several times. A scene filming the helicopters from above created a major downdraft and cameraman John Jordan's foot was severed by the craft's rotor. The concluding shots involved explosions, which the Japanese government did not allow in a national park. So, the crew moved to Torremolinos, Spain, which was found to resemble the Japanese landscape. The shots of the volcano were filmed at Shinmoedake on Kyushu Island. The sets of SPECTRE's volcano base were constructed at a lot inside Pinewood Studios, with a cost of 1 million and including operative heliport and monorail. The 45 m 148 ft tall set could be seen from 5 kilometres 3 miles away, and attracted many people from the region. Locations outside Japan included using the Royal Navy frigate HMS Tenby, then in Gibraltar, for the sea burial, Hong Kong for the scene where Bond fakes his death, and Norway for the Soviet radar station. Sean Connery's then wife Diane Cilento performed the swimming scenes for at least five Japanese actresses, including Mie Hama. Martial arts expert Donn F. Draeger provided martial arts training, and also doubled for Connery. Lewis Gilbert's regular editor, Thelma Connell, was originally hired to edit the film. However, after her initial, almost three hour cut received a terrible response from test audiences, Peter R. Hunt was asked to re edit the film. Hunt's cut proved a much greater success, and he was awarded the director's chair on the next film as a result. The soundtrack was the fourth of the series to be composed by John Barry. He tried to incorporate the elegance of the Oriental sound with Japanese music inspired tracks. The theme song, You Only Live Twice , was composed by Barry and lyricist Leslie Bricusse and sung by Nancy Sinatra after her father Frank Sinatra passed on the opportunity. Nancy Sinatra was reported to be very nervous while recording first she wanted to leave the studio then she claimed to sometimes sound like Minnie Mouse . Barry declared that the final song uses 25 different takes. British singer Julie Rogers recorded an alternative song for the titles, but this was not used. There are two versions of the song You Only Live Twice , sung by Nancy Sinatra, one directly from the movie soundtrack, and a second one for record release arranged by Billy Strange. The movie soundtrack song is widely recognised for its striking opening bars and oriental flavour, and was far more popular on radio. The record release made No. 44 on the Billboard charts in the USA, No. 11 in UK. Both versions of the title song are available on CD. In 1992, Acen sampled the title song You Only Live Twice for his song Trip II the Moon Part 2 . In 1997, Icelandic singer Bjork recorded a cover version. In 1998, Robbie Williams used the distinctive string figure for his song Millennium although it was re recorded, rather than sampled from the movie, for cost reasons . Coldplay covered it when they toured in 2001, and it was covered by Natacha Atlas for her 2005 compilation album The Best of Natacha Atlas. Shirley Bassey who has three original Bond themes to her credit has also covered the song. A different title song was originally recorded by Julie Rogers, but eventually discarded. Only two lines from that version were kept in the final lyrics, and the orchestral part was changed to fit Sinatra's vocal range. Rogers' version only appeared in a James Bond 30th Anniversary CD, with no singer credit. In the 1990s, an alternative example of a possible theme song also called You Only Live Twice and sung by Lorraine Chandler was discovered in the vaults of RCA Records. It became a very popular track with followers of the Northern soul scene Chandler was well known for her high quality soul output on RCA and can be found on several RCA soul compilations. To promote the film, Eon Productions produced a one hour colour television programme titled Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond first aired on 2 June 1967 in the United States on NBC. Bond regulars Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn appeared playing respectively Miss Moneypenny and Q . Kate O'Mara appears as Miss Moneypenny's assistant. The programme shows clips from You Only Live Twice and the then four existing Bond films, and contained a storyline of Moneypenny trying to establish the identity of Bond's bride. You Only Live Twice premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. It was the first premiere of a James Bond film that Queen Elizabeth II attended. The film grossed 43 million in the United States and over 111 million worldwide. Critical response today is mostly positive, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 72 approval rating based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 6.5 10. The website's critical consensus reads, With exotic locales, impressive special effects, and a worthy central villain, You Only Live Twice overcomes a messy and implausible story to deliver another memorable early Bond flick. However, most reviews pointed out various flaws in the film. James Berardinelli said that the first half was good, but during the second half, as the plot escalates beyond the bounds of preposterousness, that the film starts to fragment , criticising Blofeld's appearance and stating rockets that swallow up spacecraft are a bit too extravagant. Roger Ebert criticised the focus on gadgets, declaring that the James Bond formula fails to work its magic . John Brosnan in his book James Bond in the Cinema compared the film to an episode of Thunderbirds with a reliance on gadgetry but admitted it had pace and spectacle. Christopher Null considered the film one of James Bond's most memorable adventures, but the plot protracting and quite confusing . Ali Barclay of BBC Films panned Dahl's script displaying a whole new world of villainy and technology. Leo Goldsmith lauded the volcano base as the most impressive of Ken Adam's sets for the franchise. Danny Peary wrote that You Only Live Twice should have been about twenty minutes shorter and described it as not a bad Bond film, but it doesn't compare to its predecessors the formula had become a little stale. IGN ranked You Only Live Twice as the fourth best Bond film, and Entertainment Weekly as the second best, considering that it pushes the series to the outer edge of coolness . But Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the fifth worst, criticising the plot, action scenes and little screentime for Blofeld. Literary critic Paul Simpson called the film one of the most colourful of the series and credited the prefecture of Kagoshima for adding a good flavour of Japanese influence on the film, but he panned the depiction of Blofeld as a let down , small, bald and a whooping scar. Simon Winder said that the film is perfect for parodies of the series. The film is recognised by American Film Institute in these lists",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Only%20Live%20Twice%20%28film%29
"You Only Live Twice is the eleventh novel and twelfth book in Ian Fleming's James Bond series of stories. It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1964 and sold out quickly. It was the last Fleming novel published in his lifetime. It is the concluding chapter in what is known as the Blofeld Trilogy . The story starts eight months after the murder of Tracy Bond, which occurred at the end of the previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond is drinking and gambling heavily and making mistakes on his assignments when, as a last resort, he is sent to Japan on a semi diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt. The novel deals on a personal level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post World War II British power and influence, notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre orders in the UK totalling 62,000 critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper and Playboy magazine, and also adapted for comic strip format in the Daily Express. In 1967, it was released as the fifth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, starring Sean Connery as Bond. The novel has also been adapted as a radio play and broadcast on the BBC. After the wedding day murder of his wife, Tracy see On Her Majesty's Secret Service , Bond begins to let his life slide, drinking and gambling heavily, making mistakes and turning up late for work. His superior in the Secret Service, M, had been planning to dismiss Bond, but decides to give him a last chance opportunity to redeem himself by assigning him to the diplomatic branch of the organisation. Bond is subsequently re numbered 7777 and handed an impossible mission convincing the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka, to provide Britain with information from radio transmissions captured from the Soviet Union, codenamed Magic 44. In exchange, the Secret Service will allow the Japanese access to one of their own information sources. Bond is introduced to Tanakaand to the Japanese lifestyleby an Australian intelligence officer, Dikko Henderson. When Bond raises the purpose of his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that the Japanese have already penetrated the British information source and Bond has nothing left to bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing Garden of Death in a rebuilt ancient castle on the island of Kyushu people flock there to commit suicide. After examining photos of Shatterhand and his wife, Bond discovers that Shatterhand and his wife are Tracy's murderers, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma Bunt. Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and think as a mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond Taro Todoroki for the mission. After infiltrating the Garden of Death and the castle where Blofeld spends his time dressed in the costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is captured and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with his bare hands in a fit of violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, while the rest of the world believes him dead his obituary appears in the newspapers. While Bond's health improves, Kissy conceals his true identity to keep him forever to herself. Kissy eventually sleeps with Bond and becomes pregnant, and hopes that Bond will propose marriage after she finds the right time to tell him about her pregnancy. Bond reads scraps of newspaper and fixates on a reference to Vladivostok, making him wonder if the far off city is the key to his missing memory he tells Kissy he must travel to Russia to find out. The central character in the novel is James Bond himself and the book's penultimate chapter contains his obituary, purportedly written for The Times by M. The obituary provides a number of biographical details of Bond's early life, including his parents' names and nationalities. Bond begins You Only Live Twice in a disturbed state, described by M as going to pieces , following the death of his wife Tracy eight months previously. Academic Jeremy Black points out that it was a very different Bond to the character who lost Vesper Lynd at the end of Casino Royale. Given a final chance by M to redeem himself with a difficult mission, Bond's character changes under the ministrations of Dikko Henderson, Tiger Tanaka and Kissy Suzuki. The result, according to Benson, is a Bond with a sense of humour and a purpose in life. Benson finds the transformation of Bond's character to be the most important theme in the novel that of rebirth. This is suggested in Bond's attempt at a Haiku, written in the style of Japanese poet Matsuo Basho You only live twice Once when you are born And once when you look death in the face The rebirth in question is that of Bond, transformed from the heavy drinker mourning his wife at the beginning of the book to a man of action and then, after the death of Blofeld, becoming Taro Todoroki, the Japanese partner of Kissy Suzuki. While Bond is in his action phase, Benson sees Fleming's writing becoming allegorical and epic, using Bond as a symbol of good against the evil of Blofeld. As in Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond is referred to as St George in his fight against the dragon, this time by Tiger Tanaka, who says that it would make the subject for a most entertaining Japanese print. According to the author of continuation Bond novels, Raymond Benson, Kissy Suzuki is a most appealing heroine and apparently loves Bond very much. Apart from being the mother of Bond's unborn child at the end of the book, Suzuki also acts as a cultural translator for Bond, helping explain the local traditions and customs Quarrel had the same function in Live and Let Die and Dr. No. Academic Christoph Lindner identifies Tiger Tanaka as one of Fleming's characters with morals closer to those of traditional villains, but who act on the side of good in support of Bond others of this type have included Darko Kerim From Russia, with Love , Marc Ange Draco On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Enrico Colombo Risico . Blofeld makes his third appearance in the Bond series in You Only Live Twice and Benson notes that on this occasion he is quite mad and egocentric in his behaviour Tanaka refers to him as a devil who has taken human form . Comentale, Watt and Willman note that Fleming, through Bond, parallels Blofeld with Caligula, Nero and Hitler, and that this exemplifies Blofeld's actions as being on a titanic scale , as much of the criminal action was throughout the Bond series. Lindner echoes this, noting that the crimes perpetrated are not against individuals per se, but entire nations or continents. Much in the novel concerns the state of Britain in world affairs. Black points out that the reason for Bond's mission to Japan is that the US did not want to share intelligence regarding the Pacific, which it saw as its private preserve . As Black goes on to note, however, the defections of four members of MI6 to the Soviet Union had a major impact in US intelligence circles on how Britain was viewed. The last of the defections was that of Kim Philby in January 1963, while Fleming was still writing the first draft of the novel. Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the 1963 Profumo affair as a backdrop. The theme of Britain's declining position in the world is also dealt with in conversations between Bond and Tanaka, Tanaka voicing Fleming's own concerns about the state of Britain in the 1950s and early 60s. Tanaka accuses Britain of throwing away the empire with both hands this would have been a contentious situation for Fleming, as he wrote the novel as the IndonesiaMalaysia confrontation was breaking out in December 1962, a direct challenge to British interests in the region. Fleming's increasingly jaundiced views on America appear in the novel too, through Bond's responses to Tiger's comments, and they reflect on the declining relationship between Britain and America this is in sharp contrast to the warm, co operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books. You Only Live Twice is the twelfth book the eleventh novel of Fleming's Bond series and the last book completed by Fleming before his death. The story is the third part of the Blofeld trilogy, coming after Thunderball, where SPECTRE is introduced, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where Blofeld is involved in the murder of Bond's wife. You Only Live Twice was the last book by Fleming that was published in his lifetime he died five months after the UK release of the novel. It was written in January and February 1963 in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate. The original manuscript was 170 pages long and the least revised of all Fleming's novels, with a mood that is dark and claustrophobic, reflecting Fleming's own increasing melancholia. The story was written after the film version of Dr. No was released in 1962, and Bond's personality was somewhat skewed towards the screen persona rather than simply to Fleming himself Sean Connery's filmic depiction of Bond affected the book version, with You Only Live Twice giving Bond a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories, although Fleming himself was part Scottish. Correspondence dating back to 1960 shows that Fleming contacted a Scottish nobleman to help develop Bond's family history, in particular seeking a Scottish Bond family line. Fleming's first trip to Japan was as part of the Thrilling Cities trip undertaken for The Sunday Times in 1959, although his visit only lasted for three days. He returned in 1962 and was accompanied on his trip round the country by Australian friend Richard Hughes and Tiger Saito, both journalists. In You Only Live Twice, these two characters became Dikko Henderson and Tiger Tanaka, respectively. Hughes was also the model for Old Craw in John le Carre's The Honourable Schoolboy. The novel contains a fictional obituary of Bond, purportedly published in The Times, which provided details of Bond's early life, although many of these were Fleming's own traits. These included Bond's expulsion from Eton College, which was part of Fleming's own history. As with a number of the previous Bond stories, You Only Live Twice used names of individuals and places that were from Fleming's past. Bond's mother, Monique Delacroix, was named after two women in Fleming's life Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, a girl Fleming was engaged to in the early 1930s, with Delacroix taken from Fleming's own mother, whose maiden name was Ste Croix Rose. Bond's aunt was called Charmian Bond Charmian was the name of Fleming's cousin who married Richard Fleming, Ian's brother. Charmian's sister was called Pet which, when combined with the Bottom from Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, gives Pett Bottom, where Charmian lives. Pett Bottom is also the name of a real place which amused Fleming when he stopped for lunch after a round of golf at Royal St George's Golf Club, Sandwich. Ernst Stavro Blofeld's name partially comes from Tom Blofeld, a Norfolk farmer and a fellow member of Fleming's club Boodle's, who was a contemporary of Fleming's at Eton. Tom Blofeld's son is Henry Blofeld, a sports journalist, best known as a cricket commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio. For Blofeld's pseudonym in the novel, Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, Fleming uses the name of an old cafe he had seen in Hamburg in 1959 Old Shatterhand , a fictional character penned in a series of Western stories along with Winnetou by German writer Karl May . The characterisation of him dressed as a samurai was taken from the sketch Fleming had come up with thirty five years earlier for a character called Graf Schlick. Fleming, Bond's obituary You Only Live Twice, Chapter 21 You Only Live Twice was published in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He is very much in favour of the toad ... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should be sitting in a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye peering through them he thinks that will be just splendid Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me. You Only Live Twice was published in the United States by New American Library in August 1964 it was 240 pages long and cost 4.50. Cyril Connolly, reviewing You Only Live Twice in The Sunday Times, wrote that Fleming's latest book was reactionary, sentimental, square, the Bond image flails its way through the middle brow masses, a relaxation to the great, a stimulus to the humble, the only common denominator between Kennedy and Oswald . The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do ... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really get going until more than half way through . In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, though Mr. Fleming's macabre imagination is as interesting as ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone . Dealing with the cliffhanger ending to the story, the reviewer wrote that Mr. Fleming would keep us on tenterhooks, but at this rate of going even his most devoted admirers will free themselves before very long. The critic for The Spectator felt that Ian Fleming has taken a hint from films of his books and is now inclined to send himself up. I am not at all sure that he is wise , while The Belfast Telegraph considered that Fleming was still in a class of his own. The Bookman declared that You Only Live Twice must rank among the best of the Bonds . Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in Esquire magazine, disagreed, writing that You Only Live Twice has a decidedly perfunctory air. Bond can only manage to sleep with his Japanese girl with the aid of colour pornography. His drinking sessions seem somehow desperate, and the horrors are too absurd to horrify ... it's all rather a muddle and scarcely in the tradition of Secret Service fiction. Perhaps the earlier novels are better. If so, I shall never know, having no intention of reading them. Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice though far from the best Bond, is really almost as easy to read as any of them . He was critical of a number of aspects, saying that the narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour ... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality. In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that I think he must be getting tired of the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all . Iles reasoned that of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice ... only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller , and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities . Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two minds about the book, believing on the one hand that the background is excellent ... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan , and on the other that You Only Live Twice is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being . Maggie Ross, in The Listener, was also a little dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some of the more interesting parts of Japan. She went on to say that since not very much in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, perhaps it is better to ignore the whole thing . Robert Fulford, in the Toronto based magazine Maclean's, noted that the characteristic which makes Fleming appear so silly also helps make him so popular his moral simplicity. When we read James Bond we know whose side we are on, why we are on that side and why we are certain to win. In the real world that is no longer possible. Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission is aimed at restoring Britain's pre World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent. The Boston Globe's Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was Bond's latest and grimmest mission , which she called Escapism in the Grand Manner . You Only Live Twice was adapted for serialisation in the Daily Express newspaper on a daily basis from 2 March 1964 onwards. You Only Live Twice was serialised in the April, May and June 1964 issues of Playboy magazine. Ian Fleming's novel was adapted as a daily comic strip published in the Daily Express newspaper, and syndicated worldwide. The adaptation, written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky, ran from 18 May 1965 to 8 January 1966. It was the final James Bond strip for Gammidge, while McClusky returned to illustrating the strip in the 1980s. The strip was reprinted by Titan Books in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011. In 1967, the book was adapted into the fifth film in the Eon Productions series, starring Sean Connery as Bond. Only a few elements of the novel and a limited number of Fleming's characters survive into the film version. In 1990, the novel was adapted into a 90 minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2013.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Only%20Live%20Twice%20%28novel%29
"You Really Got Me is a song written by Ray Davies for English rock band the Kinks. The song, originally performed in a more blues oriented style, was inspired by artists such as Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. Two versions of the song were recorded, with the second performance being used for the final single. Although it was rumoured that future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page had performed the song's guitar solo, the myth has since been proven false. You Really Got Me was built around power chords perfect fifths and octaves and heavily influenced later rock musicians, particularly in the genres of heavy metal and punk rock. Built around a guitar riff played by Dave Davies, the song's lyrics were described by Dave as a love song for street kids. You Really Got Me was released on 4 August 1964 as the group's third single, and reached number one on the UK singles chart the next month, remaining for two weeks. The song became the group's breakthrough hit it established them as one of the top British Invasion acts in the United States, reaching number seven there later in the year. You Really Got Me was later included on the Kinks' debut album, Kinks. American rock band Van Halen adapted the song for their 1978 self titled debut album it was released as their first single and peaked at 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. Ray Davies You Really Got Me was written by Ray Davies, the Kinks' vocalist and main songwriter, sometime between 9 and 12 March 1964. Created on the piano in the front room of the Davies' home, the song was stylistically very different from the finished product, being much lighter and somewhat jazz oriented. Ray said of the song's writing, When I came up with 'You Really Got Me' I hadn't been writing songs very long at all. It was one of the first five I ever came up with. During the spring of 1964, Ray Davies played an early version of You Really Got Me on piano to rock photographer Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray sat down and plonked out, 'Der der, der, Der der ' He said, 'What do you reckon to this ' It meant nothing to me at the time, but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'. Ray, initially planning for the song to be a more laid back number , later played the chords of the song to brother Dave Davies, the Kinks' lead guitarist. However, upon hearing the track, Dave decided that the riff would be much more powerful on a guitar. Ray said of the track's change to a guitar centred track, I wanted it to be a jazz type tune, because that's what I liked at the time. It's written originally around a sax line ... Dave ended up playing the sax line in fuzz guitar and it took the song a step further. The band then began to perform the new track in some of their live shows, where it was well received. In 1998, Ray said, I'd written 'You Really Got Me' as tribute to all those great blues people I love Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in the Jazz on a Summer's Day movie , and as he sat at the piano at home, he sort of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan and came up with this figure based on a 12 bar blues . Dave has also said that song had been inspired by Jimmy Giuffre's song The Train and the River . According to the band's manager, Larry Page, the song's characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen's Louie Louie . Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band's first serious female fans. Shel Talmy, producer of You Really Got Me The song was recorded by the Kinks at least twice in the summer of 1964. The band's demo was in a bluesy style, while a full studio version recorded in June was slower and less emphatic than the final single. Shel Talmy had, according to Davies, covered the track in reverb, all but burying the lead guitar. The band wanted to rerecord the song, but their record company Pye refused to fund another session on the grounds that the band's first two singles had failed to chart. Ray Davies, however, threatened that he would refuse to perform or promote the single unless it was rerecorded. Manager Larry Page also refused to publish the original recording. When Pye stood its ground, the band's own management broke the stalemate by funding the session themselves. Ray Davies' adamant attitude on behalf of the career making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks. Davies later said, I was floundering around trying to find an identity. It was in 1964 that I managed to do that, to be able to justify myself and say, 'I exist, I'm here.' I was literally born when that song hit. The influential distortion sound of the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called little green , after the name of the amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC 30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, My brother is lying. I don't know why he does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the speaker cone up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and Pete ... Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound. According to recent Kinks' releases that give full official performance credits of the track, group members Ray Davies vocals and rhythm guitar , Dave Davies lead guitar , Pete Quaife bass are joined by session men Bobby Graham drums , and Arthur Greenslade piano . Regular Kinks drummer Mick Avory plays the tambourine. The guitar solo on the recording has been the subject of the persistent myth that it was not played by the Kinks' lead guitarist Dave Davies, but by then session player Jimmy Page, who later joined the Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. Among those claiming Page played lead guitar was Jon Lord of Deep Purple, who also claimed to play piano on the track. Page has always denied playing the song's guitar solo, going so far as to state in a 1970s interview cited in Sound on Sound magazine that I didn't play on 'You Really Got Me' and that's what pisses him off. Rock historian and author Doug Hinman makes a case that the rumour was begun and fostered by the established British rhythm and blues community, many of whose members were resentful that an upstart band of teenagers such as the Kinks could produce such a powerful and influential blues based recording, seemingly out of nowhere. Shel Talmy, the producer on the track, has gone on record and put the controversy to rest in an interview with The Guardian, saying contrary to myth, Jimmy didn't play on 'You Really Got Me'. In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying Oh, Crikey I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.' So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me. In his 1998 autobiographical release The Storyteller, Ray Davies discusses the guitar solo. He confirms that his brother Dave played the solo and it was preceded by some bantering between the two Halfway through the song it was time for Dave's guitar solo. This moment had to be right. So I shouted across the studio to Dave, give him encouragement. But I seemed to spoil his concentration. He looked at me with a dazed expression. 'Fuck off.' If you doubt me, if you doubt what I'm saying, I challenge you to listen to the original Kinks recording of 'You Really Got Me'. Halfway through the song, after the second chorus, before the guitar solo, there's a drum break. Boo ka, boo boo ka, boo ka, boo boo. And in the background you can hear 'fuck off'. You can, you can. When I did the vocal I tried to cover it up by going 'Oh no', but in the background you still hear it 'fuck off'. And it's even clearer on CD, it's really embarrassing. While Ray Davies had been instructed at the time to write Beatle type material for commercial reasons, You Really Got Me was written as a more R B based composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as instantly identifiable. American musicologist Robert Walser described You Really Got Me as the first hit song built around power chords. The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, 'You Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal. However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying I've never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the soundif you played it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful. The lyrics of the song are about lust and sex. Dave Davies said of the song's lyrics, 'You Really Got Me' such a pure record, really. It's a love song for street kids. They're not going to wine and dine you, even if they knew how to chat you up. 'I want youcome here.' You Really Got Me was released as the band's third single on 4 August 1964, backed with It's Alright . Within three days of the single's release, You Really Got Me began to appear on local charts. Eventually, the song climbed to the top of the British charts, the band's first single to do so. Ray Davies later claimed that, due to the single's high demand, Pye Records put all their other records on hold to solely produce copies of You Really Got Me . Due to the high level of success the single achieved in the UK, a rush release of You Really Got Me was put out in the US on 2 September 1964, despite being delayed from its initial release date of 26 August. Although it did not enter the charts until 26 September, the record rose to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. The song later appeared on the band's debut album, Kinks, with the title of the American release of the album being changed to You Really Got Me. Plans for Ray to sing versions of the song in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese for their respective markets were proposed by Shel Talmy, but they never materialized. Ray Davies Upon release, the single received a positive review from Record Mirror, which said, Highly promising group with strong guitar sound and a compact sort of vocal performance. Mid tempo but bustling song should sell well. In Melody Maker, singer Dave Berry was featured in a blindfold test of the song, with Berry at first guessing the song was by the Kingsmen. He said, It's fabulous, this one. I like these records that sound as if they've gone into a recording studio and done what they wanted to on the spot. It's a good chance of being a big hit. The Melody Maker review had a lasting impact on Ray Davies, who said that Berry had a few hits so he mattered and that Berry's belief that the band had done what they wanted had said it all for him. The Kinks' use of distorted guitar riffs continued with songs like All Day and All of the Night , Tired of Waiting for You , and Set Me Free , among others. Pete Townshend of the Who, a band also produced by Talmy at that time, has stated that their first single, I Can't Explain , was influenced by the Kinks' work at the time. Other artists influenced by You Really Got Me include Tom Petty, John Lydon, Chris Bell of Big Star, and Jimi Hendrix, who, according to Dave Davies, described the song as a landmark record . In 1999, You Really Got Me was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at number 82 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time and at number four on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. In early 2005, the song was voted the best British song of the 19551965 decade in a BBC radio poll. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at number nine in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2009, it was named the 57th Greatest Hard Rock Song by VH1. Prior to its release, the Kinks performed You Really Got Me in some of their early concerts. It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming to feel a connection with the crowd as he performed the song. Ray later said, Our success came from playing live. When we played 'You Really Got Me' people actually took notice. They realised we had something original. The Kinks continued to perform successfully for over 30 years through many musical styles, but You Really Got Me remained a mainstay in concert. During some shows, the song was played in a medley with its follow up single All Day and All of the Night, while in 1977, a performance on Saturday Night Live featured a four song medley of You Really Got Me , All Day and All of the Night , A Well Respected Man , and Lola . In a live performance on the Don Lane Show in 1982, You Really Got Me was featured in a medley with the band's 1981 song, Destroyer. In 1984, Dave Davies claimed that, even after twenty years of performing You Really Got Me, the track was still fun to play live. A live version of You Really Got Me was released on the band's 1980 live album, One for the Road. This version, following the minor success of the same album's live version of Lola , was released as a single in America, backed with the live take of Low Budget's Attitude . However, the single failed to chart. This version was later included on the 1986 compilation album, Come Dancing with the Kinks The Best of the Kinks 19771986. Other live renditions of You Really Got Me have also been released. A version on Live at Kelvin Hall recorded at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow, Scotland was released in 1967, while a performance at the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania appeared on 1994's To the Bone. The Davies brothers also performed a live version in Boston, Massachusetts with the Smithereens in November 1991, which later appeared on the latter band's 1995 compilation album Attack of the Smithereens. Both Ray and Dave Davies still perform the song in solo shows, generally as a closing number. In December 2015, Ray Davies joined brother Dave onstage at one of his concerts to perform You Really Got Me . The event marked the first time the brothers performed on stage together in nearly twenty years, sparking rumors of a possible Kinks reunion. The American hard rock band Van Halen released a cover of You Really Got Me for their 1978 debut album, Van Halen. As the band's first single, it was a popular radio hit which helped jump start the band's career, as it had done for the Kinks 14 years earlier. This version, which was cited by Eddie Van Halen as an updated version of the original, featured histrionic guitar playing by Eddie Van Halen and vocal shenanigans by David Lee Roth. The song had been played by the band live for years before its studio release. On the radio, it is often featured with Eruption , the instrumental that precedes it on the album, as an intro. The song was released as a single as a result of an encounter between Eddie Van Halen and members of the band Angel. Eddie Van Halen and Angel drummer Barry Brandt had both been bragging about their new material to one another, resulting in Eddie Van Halen showing a demo of You Really Got Me to Brandt. On the following day, the band's producer, Ted Templeman told Van Halen that Angel was recording their own cover of You Really Got Me to release before Van Halen's version. As a result, the song was rush released as a single before Angel could do so. Eddie Van Halen has since expressed dissatisfaction with the use of You Really Got Me as the band's debut single. He said, It kind of bummed me out that Ted wanted our first single to be someone else's tune. I would have maybe picked Jamie's Cryin' , just because it was our own. The Kinks' Dave Davies has claimed to dislike Van Halen's rendition of the song, saying There's the thing good art isn't always about having the comfiest technique. I shouldn't encourage him, but I'm sure Eddie Van Halen played better when he was drunk. He also told of how a concert goer approached him after a live show and congratulated him on performing a great cover of the Van Halen song. Ray Davies, on the other hand, claimed to like the track because it made him laugh. Citations Sources",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Really%20Got%20Me
"You Rock My World is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his tenth and final studio album Invincible 2001 It was released as the lead single from the album on August 22, 2001 by Epic Records. You Rock My World peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Jackson's last top ten song in the United States until Love Never Felt So Good , which featured Justin Timberlake, peaked at number 9 in 2014. The track reached number one in France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, and Spain. It also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 44th Grammy Awards. As part of promotion for You Rock My World , a music video was released. The video, which is thirteen and a half minutes long, was directed by Paul Hunter and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando. In the video, Jackson and Tucker portray men who are trying to gain a woman's affection. The video has been compared to Jackson's previous videos Smooth Criminal and The Way You Make Me Feel . You Rock My World was performed only twice by Jackson at Madison Square Garden in New York City at two concerts on September 7th and the 10th on 2001 to celebrate Jackson's career as a solo artist. Footage of the performance was shown in the two hour CBS television special, Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Celebration. You Rock My World was recorded by Michael Jackson for his studio album, Invincible 2001 . The song was written and composed by Michael Jackson, Rodney Jerkins and produced by Jackson and Jerkins. You Rock My World was officially released as the lead single from the album in mid August 2001, by Epic Records. Prior to the singles official release it had been leaked to two New York radio stations on Friday, August 17. Immediately after the songs radio airplay the radio stations had received a herd of callers asking for more. You Rock My World was first played on the WJTM FM station at 6 p.m., with WKTU FM airing the song 45 minutes later. Both stations had played the single every two hours until around 6 p.m. Saturday, when Jackson's record label, Epic Records, called the program director for both stations, Frankie Blue, who was also a friend of Jackson, and asked him to stop. Blue later recalled, They informed me of the dangers of playing a song too early. He refused to say how the song came into his possession. You Rock My World is credited as being an uptempo post disco and R B song that has vibrating vocal harmonies. The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E3 to Bb4. You Rock My World has a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7C9 Bm7Am7DEm7. The song's composition has been compared to Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the disco theme from Jackson's 1979 single, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . Chris Tucker voices the vocal introduction of the song while all the instruments heard on the track were played by Jackson and Rodney Jerkins. Lyrically, the song's lyrics are about being in love, as well as the effect that it can have, as evident in the opening line, My life will never be the same, 'cause, girl, you came and changed the way I walk, the way I talk, I cannot explain . Praise was mainly directed at the song's composition, while dissatisfaction towards the song was expressed by critics because they felt that the track was not Jackson's best material. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic listed You Rock My World as being a highlight for the Invincible album. Reviewer Andrew Hamilton, also of AllMusic, stated that, If anybody other than Michael Jackson had released 'You Rock My World' with the tons of publicity and promotion it was accorded, it would have slam dunked the charts and been a multiple award winner. It sold well and got play everywhere, but too many critics panned the song and the album it came from as not being good enough for an artist on Jackson's level. Hamilton commented that people should give Michael credit because he was able to maintain a respectable career as a recording artist over the years of his later career. James Hunter of Rolling Stone praised the song's vocal rhythms as being finely sculpted and exquisite . He noted that the song shows similarities to Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones. Mark Beaumont, a writer for NME, described the song as being a disco classic and commented that he felt that the song's brief intro was funnier than Chris Evans on fire . Catherine Halaby of Yale Daily News stated that the song showcases the best of 'classic Michael' , and described the song as being funky, catchy, upbeat, not too creepy . You Rock My World was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance Male at the 44th Grammy Awards, but it lost the award to James Taylor's Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight . It was Jackson's first Grammy nomination since 1997, for his single Earth Song , and his first nomination in that category since 1995. You Rock My World was commercially successful, generally charting within the top ten positions on music charts worldwide. The song was one of Jackson's last hit singles in the United States in the final years of his career. You Rock My World charted within the top twenty positions on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 15, 2001. The following week, the song charted at its peak position, number ten. It became Jackson's highest charting single since his 1995 number one single, You Are Not Alone . You Rock My World also charted at number seven and thirteen on Billboard's Pop chart and R B Hip Hop Songs respectively. Notably, these chart positions were attained based on airplay alone, as no commercial single was issued in the United States. Fred Bronson, Billboard's chart expert at the time, remarked, Certainly, if a commercial single had been available, it would have peaked higher perhaps even at no.1 . The song also charted within the top ten positions, peaking at number two, on the Canadian RPM Hot 100 chart. You Rock My World debuted on the United Kingdom Singles Chart at number two, which was its peak position in the country, on October 20. The song remained within the top twenty positions on the chart for four consecutive weeks, and remained within the top 100 positions for fifteen consecutive weeks from October 20, 2001, to January 26, 2002.

As part of promotion for the single, as well as the album, Jackson made a public appearance by celebrating his 43rd birthdayone day lateby presiding over the NASDAQ market opening ceremony in Times Square on Thursday morning, on August 30, 2001. Jackson only performed You Rock My World twice. The only performances of You Rock My World was during two concerts in early September 2001, which was to celebrate Jackson's 30th year as solo artist, at Madison Square Garden. Tucker, who is part of the song's dialogue and video, was part of the live performance. Footage of the second concert on September 10 was shown in a two hour television special, titled Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Celebration, which was aired on CBS in November of the same year. The music video for You Rock My World was directed by Paul Hunter, and was released in 2001. The video, which is over thirteen minutes long, was described as being a short film. The dance performed during the video consists of fragments from the canceled Dangerous music video. The video consists of Jackson's and Tucker's characters trying to gain a woman's Kishaya Dudley affection by subsequently following her around the neighborhood. But in the end, a fight brokes out between the gang members that are ordered by their leader Michael Madsen to get rid of Jackson and where Jackson walks up the stage where his backup dancers arrived. After being taunted, a dance break begins after a man lights his lighter and where one of the gang members used a knife on Jackson but Jackson tosses him down. Then, he punches the leader in the face forcing a lamp to tumble over and started a fire while Jackson screams for Tucker, who was dancing to the song and knocking out some of the guys. During the escape, the woman who met Jackson stops Jackson to get a kiss until Tucker rolls in with a low rider signalling for Jackson and his new lover to escape leaving the burning bar in flames. The video for You Rock My World was thought to be the last music video to feature any participation from Jackson before the video for One More Chance was unearthed his following videos would consist of archive footage of himself and others . The video has been compared to Jackson's previous 1980s music videos for his singles, Smooth Criminal 1987 , Bad 1987 , and The Way You Make Me Feel 1987 , all from his 1987 studio album, Bad. In the video, Jackson can be seen wearing a blazer and his traditional hat. The video features appearances from Marlon Brando, Michael Madsen and Billy Drago. The video won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video at the award shows 2002 ceremony. In several instances in the video, Tucker's character makes several references to previous songs by Michael Jackson, such as Beat It , P.Y.T. Pretty Young Thing , The Girl Is Mine , Bad , Dangerous , and Billie Jean . The short version of the music video appears on Number Ones, and the long version appears on Michael Jackson's Vision. You Rock My World was performed twice live during the 30th anniversary concerts, which took place in late 2001. In the second concert, he was joined by Usher and Chris Tucker at the end, who danced with him. It was the only full song from Invincible that Jackson had performed live.

"You Win or You Die is the seventh episode of the first season of the HBO medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. It was written by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Daniel Minahan. Set to air May 29, 2011, the episode was released in advance immediately following the conclusion of A Golden Crown to HBO customers with access to HBO Go. The episode furthers the story line of deterioration of the political balance of the Seven Kingdoms, with Eddard Stark revealing what he has discovered to Cersei Lannister while King Robert is still away on a hunt. The title of the episode is part of a quote from Cersei Lannister during the final confrontation with Eddard When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. The catchphrase has been frequently used during the promotion of both the books and the television series. The episode was generally well received by critics for its well acted dramatic tension, but with several criticizing the coupling of exposition and nudity as sexposition . In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.4 million in its initial broadcast. Lord Tywin gives half his forces to his son Jaime to attack Riverrun, seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, believing war with the Starks will allow the Lannisters to rule the Seven Kingdoms. Osha, now a servant of Winterfell, reveals that she and her fellow wildlings were fleeing the White Walkers. Benjens horse returns from north of the Wall without him. Sam believes Jon, assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, is being groomed for command. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a heart tree, Jon's direwolf Ghost brings him a dismembered hand. Daenerys fails to convince Khal Drogo to invade her homeland. Ser Jorah receives a royal pardon and realizes Daenerys assassination has been ordered. He saves her from an attempted poisoning, and Drogo vows to lead his people to reclaim the Iron Throne for his unborn son. Ned confronts Queen Cersei with the knowledge that her children were incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime. Cersei defends her affair and reveals Robert was still in love with Ned's deceased sister, Lyanna. Ned tells Cersei to leave the capital with her children before he tells Robert the truth. Mortally wounded by a boar, Robert dictates his will and testament to Ned, naming him regent until Joffrey comes of age instead of Joffrey, Ned writes my rightful heir. Robert begs Ned to make Joffrey a better man, and tells him to let Daenerys live. Renly tries to convince Ned to launch a coup d'etat against the Lannisters, but Ned refuses and dispatches a letter to rightful heir Stannis Baratheon. Ned reveals Joffrey's heritage to Littlefinger, who suggests that if Joffrey proves an unfit ruler, they use the truth to make Renly king instead. Ned refuses, asking Littlefinger to secure the City Watchs support against Cersei's men at arms. By the time Robert dies, Renly has fled and Joffrey has ordered his own coronation. Ned and his allies present Roberts will to the court, but Cersei tears it up and orders Ser Barristan Selmy to seize Ned, who orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. Instead, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men as Littlefinger holds Ned at knifepoint, telling him I did warn you not to trust me. The episode was written by the showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original novel by George R. R. Martin. The chapters included in You Win or You Die are 46, 48 50, and 55 Eddard XII, Eddard XIII, Jon VI, Eddard XIV, and Daenerys VI , making it the episode that includes fewest chapters of the source novel in the entire first season. Among the scenes created specifically for the show were a meeting between Tywin and Jaime Lannister as Lord Tywin is field dressing a stag and a training session between Littlefinger and two new female recruits for one of his brothels. You Win or You Die marks the first appearance of Charles Dance as Lord Tywin, the patriarch of the Lannister household. Cast in the role shortly after the production began, Dance had been the first choice of the producers and one of the fan favorites for the role. Author George R. R. Martin commented that his commanding screen presence and steely charisma should make him the perfect Lord Tywin. The deer that is field dressed by Tywin in the opening scene was a real dead stag. Dance had no previous experience with skinning and gutting, and before filming the scene practiced for an hour with a butcher. Most of the episode was shot on set at the Northern Irish studios of The Paint Hall. The exteriors of the entrance of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area, and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei taking place in the Red Keep's gardens identified as a godswood in the novels the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in Rabat, in Malta. You Win or You Die 's first airing was seen by 2.4 million viewers, stabilizing the show's ratings. This could be considered positive when taking into account that the episode had been offered in advance during the preceding week in HBO's online service, and that it was aired in a three day holiday weekend which often results in lower viewership. With the second airing, the total audience for the night was 3.2 million viewers. The episode was well received by critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 20 reviews of the episode and judged 100 of them to be positive with an average score of 9 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, The cinematic, fast paced You Win or You Die thrusts the plot forward while hinting at painful moments looming for fans. Time's reviewer James Poniewozik called You Win or You Die the most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date, AOL TV's Maureen Ryan found it an excellent outing that saw the stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways, and HitFix's Alan Sepinwall called it a terrific episode and commended how it turned the spotlight on the characters who are villains in Ned Stark's version of the story. Alan Sepinwall, HitFix Poniewozik continued We knew this would be a significant episode if for no other reason than that it contains the scenealluded to in the episode's titlethat gives the series its name, a sentiment Sepinwall agreed with. Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, also considered You Win or You Die a climactic moment in the series. IGN's Matt Fowler noted that this was the episode that saw Ned Stark unfortunately thwarted by his own honorable intentions, but that his stubborn nobility is what makes Ned such a great character. The final showdown with the Lannisters seizing control from Eddard was much discussed, with many commentators criticizing Ned's ingenuity and his actions during the episode. In The Atlantic, Scott Meslow wrote that Eddard could never win the game of thrones because he is dedicated to playing by the rules. In his opinion, one can't afford to play fair when the only outcomes are win or die. McNutt felt that the climax at the episode's end was really well handled by both the cast and the director Dan Minahan . As well as the final confrontation between Eddard and Cersei, other scenes were praised by the critics. The introduction of Charles Dance as Lord Tywin Lannister was considered a beauty by Emily VanDerWerff from the A.V. Club, who admired how a single scene depicted not only the relationship between Tywin and Jaime, but also all the dynamics of the Lannister clan. She also praised the work of Nikolaj Coster Waldau in the scene, commenting that despite having few lines, he transmitted that Jaime is cowed by his father very well. Maureen Ryan agreed with that sentiment, and also lauded Natalia Tena's short appearance. David Sims a second reviewer for the A.V. Club highlighted the work of Mark Addy in his final scene, extending the praise to the rest of his work on the series. Critics agreed that the scenes with the Dothraki were strong, with the storyline having improved significantly since the first episodes. Poniewozik stated that this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but felt like the characters were as well imagined as those in Westeros, and McNutt felt the episode finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character. Drogo's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne led to compliments about Jason Momoa's intensity and Emilia Clarke's calm and loving facial expressions. However, the scene where Littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized as an example of the show's perceived abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device, a situation for which Myles McNutt coined the term sexposition. Aidan Gillen's acting was consistently praised and the comparison between Littlefinger's actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt, but many agreed with Meslow's statement that it was annoyingly overshadowed by the series' most gratuitous sex scene to date. Among other criticisms were the scene's excessive length, the repetition of the dramatic approach, and the assumption that viewers were not going to pay attention when presented with a long exposition that did not include sex.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%20Win%20or%20You%20Die
"Lum You ca. 1861 January 31, 1902 sometimes spelled Lum Yuwas an immigrant Chinese laborer and convicted murderer in the Pacific Northwest. He is famous for being the only person to have been legally executed in Pacific County, Washington, and for his death row prison break supposedly arranged by the very jailers charged with his captivity. Lum You was among the many Chinese laborers who came to Washington near the turn of the century. A proud, sociable dandy, You was well liked in the white community. He spoke a little English, and acted as an agent between the Chinese workers and their employers. In 1894 You approached the South Bend police chief, Marion Egbert, complaining that a fellow Chinese resident by the name of Ging had threatened him. Egbert brushed You off and suggested he deal with the situation himself. You took this advice, attacking Ging with an axe. For this act he was convicted of assault he was fined 500 and was sentenced to a prison term of six months. In the summer of 1901, You was employed as a cannery worker and living in Bay Center. While playing cards on August 6 of that year, he was assaulted, threatened, and robbed by Oscar Bloom, a white man with a reputation as a bully. This time You did not approach the police, but instead immediately took matters into his own hands he went to his room to retrieve his gun, sought out and shot Bloom in the abdomen, and then fled the scene. Bloom survived long enough to swear a deathbed affidavit identifying You as his killer. Public sympathy for You was high, but white employers of the Chinese workers pressed officials for action to be taken against him. Accordingly, You was arrested on August 7 and in October 1901 was tried and convicted for the murder of Oscar Bloom. Contrary to the jurors' belief that You would receive a light sentence, the judge ordered that You be hanged. The execution was scheduled for January 31, 1902. Even after his conviction You continued to enjoy public support. Petitions for clemency, one of which was signed by one of the jurors, were sent to the state governor. County officials sympathized with You, supposedly leaving his cell door unlocked at night and encouraging him to escape. You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14 one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked with the aid of a confederate. You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. On January 15 he was sighted by two men the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of 200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three man posse. You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the door was open and he walked out. On January 27 governor Henry McBride rejected one of the petitions for clemency on procedural grounds, and on January 30 confirmed by wire that he would not be commuting You's sentence. Anticipation of the execution became so great that Roney was besieged with requests to attend. Roney issued 500 invitation cards, some examples of which survive. You's hanging proceeded as planned inside the courthouse of the county seat, South Bend, on the morning of January 31, 1902. Though it had been expected that he would break down, You ate fairly well that morning and went to the gallows without assistance. He bade his friends goodbye and then uttered his last words, to his executioners Kill me good. The trap was sprung by means of a rope which, along with three dummy ropes, extended into an adjoining room. Each of the four executioners concealed in that room pulled his rope simultaneously, but only the sheriff knew which was the trigger. You's was the first and only official execution ever to take place in Pacific County. A month after his arrest, a new act of the Washington State Legislature took effect which required executions for any future crimes to be carried out at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Lum You's trial and execution attracted a great deal of contemporary publicity in Pacific County, and has since passed into the realm of folk legend. His story has been researched and recounted by local historians Ruth Dixon, Willard R. Espy, and Sydney Stevens. Espy, also a nationally renowned poet, memorialized You in a humorous epitaph. You was also the subject of a biographical play performed in the early 1980s, The Hanging of Lum You by the Oysterville based Shoalwater Storytellers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lum%20You

"You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again is an autobiography by Julia Phillips, detailing her career as a film producer and disclosing the power games and debauchery of New Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s. It was first published in 1991 and became an immediate cause celebre and bestseller. The book was reissued in 2002 after the author's death. In partnership with her husband Michael, Julia Phillips was one of the most successful film producers in Hollywood during the 1970s. Their second film, The Sting, grossed almost 160 million and won seven Academy Awards, making Julia the first woman to win a Best Picture Oscar. Their third film, Taxi Driver, brought them a second Oscar nomination and won the Palme d'Or in 1976. In 1977 they co produced their most financially successful movie, Steven Spielberg's 300 million grossing Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, Julia had long indulged in a self destructive lifestyle of excessive drug consumption, and it had begun to affect her work. Francois Truffaut, one of French cinema's most iconic directors and a star of Close Encounters, blamed her for that film's budget difficulties, and she was eventually fired during post production because of her cocaine dependence. Phillips, by now divorced, spent the following years on a downward spiral which included, by her own account, spending 120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about a kid in a tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than 5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties. The book begins by briefly introducing the reader to Phillips in 1989, before quickly travelling back to her childhood in 1940s Brooklyn. It then covers her early life and first successes in the film industry she and Michael earned 100,000 from their debut feature, Steelyard Blues, moved to Malibu, California, and had a daughter, Kate. The most notorious chapters follow as Phillips enjoys her greatest career successes, perhaps most infamously when she recalls the amalgam of drugs she was under the influence of on the night she won her Oscar a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, and a glass and a half of wine . She also reveals the personal peccadillos and vices of the biggest Hollywood A listers of the day, including Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Richard Dreyfuss, Goldie Hawn, and David Geffen. Many of these people were pivotal figures in the emergence of New Hollywood in the 1960s and '70s, but Phillips disparagingly refers to them as a rogues' gallery of nerds . Later episodes in her life, including freebasing, and her abusive relationship with a violent drug addict which caused her to miss her own mother's funeral, are also discussed candidly. David Thomson, The Independent, 13 January 2002. Most significant, from Phillips' own point of view, is her expose of the Boys' Club in the higher echelons of Hollywood, where she claimed it was her gender that led to her ultimate ostracism. If I had been a man, they would have closed ranks around me , she said, referring to her drug addiction. They hated the woman thing. And I wasn't even regarded as a woman, I was a girl. Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as you guys don't take women seriously you like us around... we aren't allowed to be players . Those same few men, like Valley viper Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency were, in her eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s. On its release most critics agreed that the book was both scandalous and career ending. Even with a quarter of the 1,000 page original manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication. Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity . Newsweek's review called it a 573 page primal scream , while one Hollywood producer said it was the longest suicide note in history . In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to a little voice inside my head 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'. Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces the title of the book in a Vibe interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. Youll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that theyre talking about, all the people that slept together. After Phillips' death from cancer in 2002 the book was reissued in paperback by Faber and Faber, and gained renewed attention. Tim Appelo wrote in his Salon.com tribute that it was mordant, merciless, outdid Capote in shrieking truth to decadent power , while David Thomson praised it as compulsive, hilarious entertainment . Commercially, Phillips' memoir became an enormous success. It quickly moved to the top of the New York Times Non Fiction Best Seller list and stayed at No. 1 for thirteen weeks. Additionally, several prominent Los Angeles bookstore owners reported it to be the fastest selling book they had ever seen. But Phillips was excoriated by Hollywood, and her autobiography's publication cost her the chance to adapt Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire with David Geffen. Furthermore, in an example of life imitating art, pre eminent Los Angeles restaurant Morton's fulfilled the book's titular prediction by declining her future patronage. Shortly before her death, when asked if she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about. She was similarly unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll%20Never%20Eat%20Lunch%20in%20This%20Town%20Again
"You'll See is a song by American singer Madonna from her ballads compilation, Something to Remember 1995 . The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. She wrote and produced the song with Canadian musician David Foster. You'll See was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, You'll See features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after the end of a love affair. The song received positive reception from contemporary critics, with reviewers praising Madonna's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ASCAP honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997. You'll See was commercially successful, reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom. The single also managed to peak at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 making it Madonna's 29th top ten single on the chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman, where the story line served as a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for Take a Bow . An alternate Spanish version, written by Argentine singer songwriter Paz Martinez, also received a music video, and was included on the Latin American edition of Something to Remember. Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour. In 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle included a cover of the song on her debut studio album I Dreamed a Dream. After a controversy fueled period, Madonna's personal life had started to dominate over her musical career. She knew it was time to make a change as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her. In November 1995, Madonna released a compilation album, Something to Remember, featuring a selection of her ballads over a decade of her career and three new songs described as a love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike the compilation was targeted to emphasize the singer's musical abilities, and away from the theatrics. On the album's liner notes, Madonna further explained So much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs are all but forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart. For the new songs, Madonna worked with David Foster, a well known producer who had worked with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not really hip enough for her . The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, You'll See and One More Chance . Foster commented At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really great. Madonna had written a great lyric 'You think that I can't live without your love You'll see' and I thought my music was great . The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995. Recording of the song was done in Brooklyn Studios and assisted by Ronnie Rivera. It was engineered and mixed by David Reitzas, who also produced the remix of Love Don't Live Here Anymore for Something to Remember. Simon Franglen provided synclavier programming for the song. Only three instruments were used for the songacoustic guitar played by Dean Parks, electric guitar played by Michael Thompson and keyboard played by Foster. A Spanish version of the song, titled Veras , was recorded by Madonna at Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. The song was translated into Spanish by Paz Martinez and was included as a bonus track on the Latin American editions of Something to Remember. You'll See premiered on the radio forums of the official Warner Bros. Records' website on October 18, 1995 and was officially released as the album's lead single on October 30, 1995. Musically, You'll See is an acoustic pop ballad. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of EmDEm as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to EmCDGCF during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita she said If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording . Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied No, it's about empowering yourself , but also adding that there's another side too which is'Don't fuck with me, I don't need anybody. I can do what I want' . Upon release, the song received generally positive feedback. According to Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker, You'll See is just one of the consumer enticements that just add to the allure . J. Randy Taraborrelli, the author of Madonna An Intimate Biography, called the song, along with One More Chance , as one of the most sombre songs has ever recorded. Billboard's Keith Caulfield opined that the track showcased Madonna's newly trained vocal abilities, which would prepare audiences for her lead role in the following year's Evita . AllMusic's Jose F. Promis described the song as an empowered, somewhat melodramatic, Latin tinged ballad that helped to even further cement Madonna as a constant on adult contemporary radio, which, in turn, further distanced her from her raunchier days earlier in the decade . Promis also praised the Spanish version Veras sings the Spanish lyrics surprisingly well . Similarly, online magazine Queerty called Veras a pleasant and unexpected surprise . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that what lacks in power or range, she makes up for with nuance and feeling ... On her 1995 hit ballad 'Youll See' she conveys both the smoldering melodrama and stoic sorrow of a woman scorned . Billboard critic Timothy White called it a bittersweet serenade. In another review from the publication, Larry Flick called it a deliciously fruitful collaboration with... Foster . Flick further added in his review Foster's flair for musical melodrama inspires Madonna to turn in what is easily her most assured and full bodied vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying over the heads of her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation. In August 2018, Billboard picked it as the singer's 90th greatest single, calling it far too seething and melodramatic ... vividly real, an honest moment of self delusion from Madonna's best era of ballads . The Huffington Post ranked the song sixth on their list of The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs author Pandora Boxx wrote This song takes a sad break up and empowers it ... This is truly a hidden gem in the vast Madonna library . Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed You'll See at number 48 of his list The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs . He wrote Madonna's declaration of independence over beautiful Spanish guitar playing is organic and inspired . Writing for The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs gave the song a more negative review it could be credited as a curtsy to Madonna's impending Evita Ray of Light comeback. Unfortunately, it also sounds like a dull displacement from a compilation of yearning '80s ballads . Nevertheless, he placed You'll See at number 69 of his list The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles . While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, The Guardian's Jude Rogers placed You'll See at number 52 and wrote that it tries hard, and snags . Entertainment Weekly's Chuck Arnold called it a dramatic precursor to Evita listing it as Madonna's 48th best single. For Medium's Richard LaBeau, it never quite reaches the heights of Take a Bow , but this collaboration with legendary songwriter and producer David Foster is one of her stronger ballads . The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ASCAP honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997. You'll See debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 8 the week of December 9, 1995. It became Madonna's highest debuting single at the time, following Erotica number 13 in 1992 and Rescue Me number 15 in 1991 . The single reached a peak position of number six the following week, thus making Madonna the third act in history after Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye to have a hit peak at each position from one to ten on the chart. The track ranked at number 51 on the Billboard year end chart for 1996. It was eventually certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA on February 27, 1996, for shipments of 500,000 copies. The song also reached the top ten of the Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Top 40 charts. Billboard ranked it at number 28 on their list of Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 97 on the RPM Top Singles chart, the week of November 6, 1995. After nine weeks, on January 15, 1996, it peaked at the second position of the chart. You'll See also reached number one on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart. In the United Kingdom, the song reached a peak of number 5 on the UK Singles Chart the week of November 4, 1995, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 14 weeks. According to the Official Charts Company, the single has sold over 305,000 physical units as of October 2010, and was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry BPI . In Australia, You'll See peaked at number 9 on the ARIA Singles Chart the week of February 18, 1996, staying on this position for two week and a total of eleven weeks on the chart. It also ranked at number 87 on the ARIA year end charts for 1995, and was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA for shipment of 35,000 copies of the single. You'll See reached a peak of number 2 in Finland, and also reached a peak of number 13 on the Irish Singles Chart. Across Europe, the song reached a peak of number eight on the European Hot 100 Singles chart on January 27, 1996. The music video for You'll See was directed by Michael Haussman, and premiered on November 7, 1995. The video became Madonna's first sequel clip, as it followed the storyline of the singer's previous video for Take a Bow , the second single from Bedtime Stories. The video for the latter had portrayed the singer being mistreated by her lover, played by Spanish Torero Emilio Munoz. In the music video for You'll See , Madonna walks out leaving him behind in despair. Also present are scenes of the singer riding a train and later on a plane, with Munoz trying to catch up with her. The last frame of the video shows Madonna smiling hopefully for a better life. The video's wardrobe was styled by noted fashion editor and stylist Lori Goldstein, who had previously worked with Madonna on Take a Bow . Another music video was created for the song's Spanish version, Veras , which was released only in Latin America. This one intersperses scenes from the original video with footage of Madonna recording the Spanish version of the song. The music video for You'll See was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography in 1996. The Spanish version of the video won the MTV Latino award for Best Female Video. In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, Celebration The Video Collection. On November 2, 1995, Madonna performed the song on British television program Top of the Pops. Six years later, she performed You'll See on some US shows of her Drowned World Tour. In his review of the show at New York City's Madison Square Garden, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani praised the French techno acoustic revamping of the powerful 'You'll See' . The performance was not included on the tour's live video album release, Drowned World Tour 2001. Welsh singer Shirley Bassey included a cover of the song on her 1996 album The Show Must Go On. Scottish singer Susan Boyle also covered the song for her debut album, I Dreamed a Dream 2009 . Reportedly, Boyle loved the song for years, and used to sing the ballad at auditions when she was cruelly turned away. At the end of the number Boyle, sometimes reduced to tears , would assert You'll see . Reviewing the album for the New York Daily News, Jim Farber felt that Boyle's voice sounded remote and idealized on the album, until You'll See , where the characteristic anger and vengeance in her vocals give her a harder character to chew on . The cover was included on the first episode of Brazilian telenovela Ti Ti Ti 2010 . When Boyle started working on the musical I Dreamed a Dream which was based on her life, she had asked Madonna's permission to use the song onstage, but Madonna denied usage of the track.

"You're Getting Old is the seventh episode and the mid season finale of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 216th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 8, 2011. In the episode, Stan begins to develop a profound sense of cynicism after celebrating his tenth birthday, where he is literally seeing everything as crap . Meanwhile, Randy latches onto a new music genre, tween wave, in an attempt to fit in, which causes problems in his marriage with Sharon. The episode was written by series co creator Trey Parker and was produced at the end of the show's spring run. He and co creator Matt Stone had created the idea of Stan's existential crisis as a parallel with their own real life aging. You're Getting Old ends abruptly Stan's parents separate and his problem remains unresolved. The conclusion was inspired by modern television dramas, which are often serialized and are less likely to have the standard happy ending. The episode created significant media attention, and was interpreted by some critics as a metaphor for the frustration experienced by creators Parker and Stone stemming from the show's continued production other critics, and several viewers, speculated on whether the episode was meant as a series finale. The episode received very positive reviews from contemporary television critics, who praised the episode's ending and overarching theme on growing older. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 2.29 million viewers the week it was broadcast. The episode's ending is continued in the mid season premiere, Ass Burgers , which aired in October 2011. You're Getting Old was released on DVD and Blu ray along with the rest of the fifteenth season on March 27, 2012. At Stan's tenth birthday party, his present from Kyle is the latest CD from a tween wave band, but Sharon forbids Stan to listen to the CD and promptly takes it away, enraging him. After Randy argues with Sharon over the matter, he decides to sit down and listen to the CD which, to the viewer and the adults, is the sound of drum beats and defecation . Randy claims to enjoy the CD, but Sharon does not believe him. As tween wave music becomes popular, Sharon and the other boys' parents forbid them from listening to any of it, and try to play for them The Police's song Every Breath You Take as an example of what they consider to be good music. To the boys and the viewer, however, it literally sounds like people defecating on the soundtrack, just as the tween wave music is presented as sounding to the adults. That night, Stan secretly listens to the confiscated music but discovers, to his confusion, that it now too sounds like shit . Stan goes to the doctor, who, after examining him, diagnoses him as a cynical asshole . From ice cream to movie trailers, Stan can now only see the bad in things, and this negative outlook alienates him from Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who begin avoiding him. When Stan catches them secretly going to the movies without him after lying about having the flu, he comes along, only for his attitude to ruin the trailers and Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman leave the theater. Cartman then coldly informs Stan that they do not want to hang out with him anymore and leaves with Kenny. As Stan and Kyle argue over this, Stan literally sees Kyle as a large piece of feces that defecates instead of talking, indicating that he sees them as shit . Sharon accuses Randy of merely feigning interest in modern music in order to hold onto his childhood dreams of being a musician, and deny that he is getting older. Randy, however, ignores her, and starts performing tween wave music at the local bowling alley under the name Steamy Ray Vaughn , with flatulence as part of the act. During a duet with a woman billing herself as Steamy Nicks , Sharon catches Randy at the bowling alley, resulting in an argument. She excoriates him for the various schemes and fads that he has often briefly taken with over the years, such as getting into fights at baseball games, playing World of Warcraft, and becoming a celebrity chef, but Randy reveals that he is unhappy, and has been for a long time. The two agree that while they are both unhappy, they do not feel the same about each other any more. Two old farmers, who previously watched Randy perform, overhear the argument and break into the Marshes' home to steal Randy's underwear, believing that they are acting humanely on its behalf. As Fleetwood Mac's song Landslide plays, Sharon and Randy separate and sell their house, with Stan, Sharon and older sibling Shelly moving into a new home. The police arrest the farmers and recover Randy's underwear. A new friendship appears to develop between Kyle and Cartman, who share a smile while playing video games together a bonding activity Stan and Kyle once shared . Stan, now completely alienated from his friends, shows no signs of his cynicism ending. You're Getting Old was the final episode of the spring run, which contained the first seven episodes of South Park's fifteenth season. The first element of the episode's plot line to be crafted was Stan's tenth birthday and his feeling of getting old, as a reference to Parker and Stone's own aging at the time of the episode's broadcast, Stone had just turned 40 and Parker was 41 . They decided to make a two part episode, with the second half airing at the beginning of the fall run, set to begin in October 2011. Parker and Stone did not write the second part until they reconvened in the fall. Another idea from which the episode was crafted was the fictional tween wave genre initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all citizens of the town of South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as Landslide . They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as our favorite thing of any South Park ever the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we just thought it was the greatest thing ever, he remarked. The dialogue between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, and was one of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode's story. The episode's main theme has been described as universal and timeless, but also specific and personal growing up and dealing with change. The episode makes it clear that Stan's pre adolescent battle with cynicism is not necessarily representative of all tweens one reviewer described the character's problem as more common to depression. The episode also mocks how cynical culture breeds cynical audiences, typified in the contemptuous trailers for predictable films during the scene set at the cinema, which often end with the insult Fuck you Sean O'Neal, in the episode's review at The A.V. Club, linked the episode's theme to modern culture The Internet has turned nearly everyone into a cynic. Time reviewer James Poniewozik disagreed with his assessment, but did note that there's definitely an argument that the instant dissection of all experience online encourages a kind of protective dismissiveness. The episode was also interpreted as a satire of immediate online responses from fans, who criticize South Park as stale but continue to watch regardless. South Park generally ends on a positive note and resets upon the next episode, in which way it is connected to traditional television sitcoms, as it does not serialize or employ story arcs with frequency. An example of this format is best characteristic of the show's early years, in which the character of Kenny was killed in each episode. In contrast, the stark, abrupt ending of You're Getting Old was inspired by modern television dramas, in which events can go poorly, and the episode ends regardless. The character of Sharon references this in one of the episode's final moments, criticizing, on a meta level, the show's form and reliance on happy endings. Stone likened this structure to an immature view of the world he remarks in the episode's DVD commentary that things do not often end on a happy note in real life. Likewise, the dialogue between Sharon and Randy near the end of the episode functions as a meta comment on the show's general form, which is consequently broken. A central element of the episodes plot line concerns the fictional tween wave genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story The Emperor's New Clothes . Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as crap or shit. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite how other people care too much about things, and that many of our big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate. The episode makes a reference to the 2011 films Mr. Popper's Penguins and Jack and Jill, the latter an Adam Sandler comedy notable for its extremely poor reception. Its inclusion in the episode was actually based on the film's trailer. Reviewers suggested various different musical genres as the tween wave genre parodied in the episode, including dubstep, crabcore, and chillwave. In addition, prior to the episode's broadcast, Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times predicted tween wave would be a spoof of the hip hop group Odd Future, who were also receiving heavy media attention at that time. In his desperate attempt to fit in with popular music, Stan's father, Randy, forms his own tween wave act Steamy Ray Vaughan, a pun on the blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who collaborates with singer Steamy Nicks, a pun on Stevie Nicks, vocalist from Fleetwood Mac. The episode also makes reference to the 2011 video game L.A. Noire, and an arcade machine for the game Custer's Revenge appears in the background during Randy's musical performance at the bowling alley. Comedy Central's press release prior to the airing of the episode alluded to its significance, stating After Stan celebrates his 10th birthday, he begins to see everything differently... The very fabric of South Park begins to unravel. Coinciding with production and performance of the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon produced by the South Park creators, there had been speculation over doubt within the writing team on the future of South Park. Following the episode's broadcast, it received significant media attention due to its ending and themes. Much of the conversation centered on the final scene of dialogue between the Marshes, with Entertainment Weekly noting it could be a not so thinly veiled way of Stone and Parker telling us they had a similar discussion about their very show. Critics pointed to a March 2011 profile in The Hollywood Reporter, in which they spoke at how they dreaded to return to producing South Park I don't know how we're going to do it. It's a nightmare. Knowing that Parker and Stone have been experiencing a bit of an existential crisis or even just restlessness definitely made tonight seem unusually thematically heavy, remarked Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club. Parker and Stone were in New York to attend the 65th Tony Awards, when they were requested for interviews and had to answer questions at press junkets regarding the episode. On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating You're Getting Old , and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. Looking back at it, it kinda does look like were kinda saying we don't want to do this anymore, but it's not really what we were saying, said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary. In its original American broadcast on June 8, 2011, You're Getting Old was watched by 2.295 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. IGN review of You're Getting Old Reaction to You're Getting Old was positive. Critics pointed to the self referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he interpreted this as intentional on the part of the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan , giving the episode an 8.5 10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating But what was interesting about Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to like anything, is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion and the Marsh parents' was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club commented on the finality of the episode, noting that although the creators were still under contract until 2013, there are already scores of people questioning on IMDB boards and Twitter whether it was, in fact, a surprise series finale. O'Neal saw the use of the Fleetwood Mac song Landslide the only song in the episode that does not feature the sounds of defecation in the episode's closing moments to have served as both a parody of a self serious drama's season finale and an actual, self serious, dramatic season finale. James Poniewozik of Time remarked that the episode moved him to tears, commenting that it is one of those episodes that managed to combine the many different things lesser South Park episodes do individually pop culture parody, scatological hilarity and stories about childhood. He described the dialogue between the Marshes as stunningly genuine, summarizing the episode as simultaneously one of the most juvenile episodes South Park has ever done, and possibly its most mature. In December 2011 Time magazine ranked the episode at 7 in its list of Top 10 TV Episodes of 2011, with James Poniewozik commenting, With no easy wrap up to Stan's depression and ending with an entirely unironic montage set to 'Landslide', South Park showed that it too can grow up if, thankfully, not by much.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re%20Getting%20Old

In the episode, Edie Nicollette Sheridan returns to Wisteria Lane after a five year absence with her new husband, Dave Neal McDonough . While Susan Teri Hatcher hesitates to make a romantic commitment to Jackson Gale Harold , Lynette Felicity Huffman struggles with her defiant teenage children and her husband's midlife crisis. Gabrielle Eva Longoria deals with her daughters' weight problems and Bree Marcia Cross faces the ramifications of her success.

According to Nielsen ratings, the episode drew over 18 million viewers, making it the most watched show of the night and the second most watched program of the week across all networks. Desperate Housewives focuses on the lives of several residents living on Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Teri Hatcher and Mike Delfino James Denton celebrate the birth of their son. Bree Hodge Marcia Cross chooses to raise her grandson while her daughter, Danielle Joy Lauren , attends college. She also issues an ultimatum, telling her husband, Orson Kyle MacLachlan , that she will leave him if he does not turn himself into the police after committing a hit and run. Gabrielle Solis Eva Longoria struggles with Carlos' Ricardo Antonio Chavira permanent blindness. Also, Edie Britt Nicollette Sheridan leaves Wisteria Lane after the other residents shun her for her malice. You're Gonna Love Tomorrow takes place five years after the aforementioned events. Important plot information that takes place during the time jump is revealed in flashbacks. Orson has completed his prison sentence and the success of Bree's catering company has provided her the opportunity to write her own cookbook. Her business partner, Katherine Mayfair Dana Delany , resents how Bree's success has changed her and intentionally sabotages Bree's television interview, further straining their friendship. A flashback reveals that Danielle married a lawyer and coldly took her son away from Bree. Meanwhile, Lynette is frustrated with Tom's Doug Savant relaxed approach to parenting their rebellious teenage sons, Porter and Preston Charlie Carver and Max Carver, respectively . She encourages him to employ more disciplinary actions. During the time jump, Susan and Mike were involved in a car crash that killed a mother and her child. As a result, the couple divorced and now share custody of their son, M.J. Mason Vale Cotton . Susan engages in a sexual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock Gale Harold , but keeps their romance a secret from her friends and family.

After five years of absence, Edie returns to Wisteria Lane with her mysterious husband, Dave Neal McDonough , who seems to have a calming effect on his ill tempered wife. Later, Dave receives a phone call from Dr. Samuel Heller Stephen Spinella , who reminds him that monthly check ins are a condition of his release. After the conversation, Dr. Heller reviews a taped therapy session in which Dave threatens to get revenge on the man who destroyed his life. You're Gonna Love Tomorrow was written by series creator and executive producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. Filming for the episode was scheduled to begin on July 7, 2008. The episode is the first to fully employ the five year jump, which was introduced in the final two minutes of the fourth season finale. While developing the fifth season, Cherry began brainstorming ways to revamp the series. He stated The soap tends to build up, and I wanted to get back to where we were that very first season, where it's just the problems of some ordinary women and they were small and relatable. Cherry credits the producers of Lost for the idea of the time jump. The writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show's poorly received second season, during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season. Cherry said that the time jump would be permanent, with executive producer Bob Daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines. Cherry had originally wanted to do a ten year jump, mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities. The writers ensured that although they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers to work with the characters without most of the baggage theyd accumulated in the earlier years, and put them into starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs. For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they could give the women a new drive. Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a fairy tale romance and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional body padding for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies as a result of their business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is a lot more conscientious about things , without losing her comedic edge. Several casting changes were made as a result of the five year jump. Neal McDonough's involvement was announced in July 2008. McDonough did not audition for the role of Dave Williams, but was offered it after meeting with Cherry. Gale Harold continued appearing as Jackson, Susan's new love interest, after appearing briefly in the flashforward segment at the end of the fourth season. The roles of the Scavo children were recast in order to reflect their new ages following the time jump. Charlie and Max Carver replaced Brent and Shane Kinsman as Preston and Porter, respectively. The Kinsman twins appeared in a flashback in this episode. Joshua Logan Moore was cast as Parker, a role previously played by Zane Huett, and Kendall Applegate joined the cast as Penny, who had previously been portrayed by several toddler actresses. Despite their casting announcements alongside the Carver twins, Moore and Applegate did not appear in You're Gonna Love Tomorrow . The flashforward segment at the end of the fourth season also introduced Kaila Say and Daniella Baltodano as Gabrielle's daughters, Juanita and Celia, respectively. Only Baltodano continued portraying her role for the fifth season Say was replaced by Madison De La Garza during the summer hiatus. Andrea Bowen, who starred as Susan's daughter, Julie, departed from the cast, as her character left for college at the end of the fourth season. Teri Hatcher expressed disappointment in the producers' decision, but Cherry stated that Bowen would return in the future. Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May 2008 that producers would not make a decision on his character until mid June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated. It was later confirmed that he would return to the series. The Wisteria Lane set, which is located on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios, underwent changes for the time jump. Production designer P. Erik Carlson explained, former production designer Thomas A. Walsh had already created a fairly Utopian world, and we wanted to exaggerate and enhance it a little bit more, mostly through the use of color. We didnt want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast. Bree's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character's catering business. Additionally, all houses were repainted with bolder colors, with the exception of Gabrielle's home, in order to reflect the Solis' financial situation. According to Nielsen ratings, You're Gonna Love Tomorrow was watched by 18.684 million viewers and held an 11.4 rating 17 share on its original American broadcast on September 28, 2008. The episode was watched in 13.105 million total households. It was number one in its timeslot, beating Sunday Night Football on NBC, Cold Case on CBS, and Family Guy and American Dad on Fox. The episode was the most watched program of the night in both total viewers and the young adult demographic. It was the second most watched program of the week across all networks by viewers 18 to 49 years old, behind Grey's Anatomy, and the second most watched program in total viewership, behind Dancing with the Stars. The episode also performed better than any original broadcast of the series since January 2008. It outperformed the fourth season finale by two million total viewers and showed a 17 percent increase in viewers 18 to 49 years old. At the time, the episode was the least watched season premiere of the series, falling half a million viewers from the fourth season premiere, Now You Know , a year earlier. However, You're Gonna Love Tomorrow outperformed Now You Know in the demographic of women between 18 and 34 years of age with an 8.3 rating 20 share in that demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode premiered on Channel 4 on October 22, 2008. It was watched by 2.39 million viewers, becoming the sixth most watched program of the week on the channel. Brian Lowry, Variety The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the five year jump a stroke of genius, effectively increasing our insight into these ladies' world by twofold. He called the Gabrielle storyline a true depiction of motherhood and applauded the scene in which Carlos and Gabrielle discuss her low self esteem. He complimented the Bree storyline, particularly the argument scene between Bree and Katherine. He enjoyed the Dave storyline, but expressed disappointment that Edie's reappearance was the only scene that involved all of the leading women. Additionally, Stransky was not intrigued by Lynette's storyline and deemed it more of the same for the character. He criticized Susan's storyline, calling it annoying. He also dismissed the writers' ploy to give viewers the impression that Mike had died for almost the entire episode. TV Guide's Matt Roush gave the episode an 'A', stating, Moving the story ahead five years didn't so much reinvent the show as it recharged and refreshed the scintillating mix of domestic comedy and sudsy intrigue that we've always enjoyed. He highlighted the comedic Gabrielle storyline while approving the additions of McDonough and Harold to the cast. In his review of the first two episodes of the season, Brian Lowry of Variety said that while You're Gonna Love Tomorrow is satisfactory and establishes the five year jump effectively, the second episode is better, calling it a knock out. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker commended the time jump as a reflection of both the characters' and series' ambitions, rating the episode a 'B '. Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe gave the episode a mixed review. She said that the time leap proved to be successful, as the show had been flailing for several seasons and concluded that, so far, at least, this season promises to be less about plot than personality. That doesn't mean the show is perfect it never was but it's better, and that's a big relief. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette's Rob Owen was positive in his review, noting that the writers handled the five year leap well, especially in regards to Lynette's storyline. He complimented the episode's comedy and expressed his hope that the time jump would allow the writers to focus on humor rather than overly dramatic storylines.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re%20Gonna%20Love%20Tomorrow

In the United States, You're Mine Eternal reached number 88 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but it experienced greater success on the Dance Club Songs chart, becoming her seventeenth number one song. Elsewhere, it reached the top 20 in Hungary and on the UK R B Chart and the top 30 in Spain. Carey co directed the music video with photographer Indrani, which depicted the singer as a mermaid swimming around the lakes at the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. Recording artist Trey Songz appears as a love interest in the video. He also features on the urban remix of the song, performing his verses in the remix video. Carey has performed the song at the BET Honors and during a performance at the Empire State Building. On December 31, 2013, Carey appeared on NBC's New Year's Eve with Carson Daly show to perform some songs. Before giving the audience some advice on love for 2014 and prior to singing The Art of Letting Go from Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, the singer announced that she would be releasing a new single on February 14, 2014, to coincide with Valentine's Day. On February 12, Carey released You're Mine Eternal as the album's third single. The single's artwork consists of Sweethearts, a brand of sugar candies. In the United States, the song was released to contemporary, rhythmic, and urban adult contemporary radio stations around the country on February 18. An urban remix featuring vocals by American recording artist Trey Songz was also made available to download digitally on February 13. In an interview with MTV News, Carey praised Songz vocal ability, saying that most artists are not able to sing and rap while maintaining a sound that's current yet also classic . Carey further released multiple dances remixes of You're Mine Eternal , including the Jump Smokers Radio Remix, Jump Smokers Extended Remix, and Jermaine Dupri X Kurd Maverick Germany To Southside Remix. Additional remixes by Fedde le Grand, Gregor Salto and Funkin Matt, and Chus and Ceballos were released on March 15. You're Mine Eternal is an R B love song written and produced by Carey and Rodney Jerkins. The song is composed in the key of D major using common time and a moderately slow feel of 75 beats per minute. Carey employs a breathy vocal style as she sings the lyric I can't seem to live without your love . Lyrically, Carey reminisces about a past lover, singing I can't seem to live without your love Suffocating here by myself Dying for your touch . Instrumentation consists of hypnotic, smooth, steady piano beat, which slowly builds to a climax with Carey hitting a whistle note for a sustained period of time at the end of the song. Music Times writer Carolyn Menyes described the up and down melodic structure as captivating , which causes the listener to be drawn deep into Carey's musical abyss . The urban remix featuring Songz incorporates an enhanced pop feel compared to the original, with additional drums and Auto Tune on Songz vocals. You're Mine garnered comparisons to one of Carey's previous singles We Belong Together 2005 . While Christina Garibaldi of MTV News and Jamieson Cox of Time simply highlighted that they have similar melodic structures and vocals styles, Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine was critical of the likeness between the two songs, writing that she was disappointed to hear a retread of We Belong Together following the positively received retro first and second singles Beautiful featuring Miguel and The Art of Letting Go , respectively. You're Mine Eternal garnered a generally positive response amongst music critics. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News was complimentary of the song, praising Carey's impressive vocal range and specifically drawing attention to the high note that she ends the song with. Garibaldi stated that You're Mine Eternal serves as a reminder as to why Carey is still the fiercest diva in the game . Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz noted that the slow structure for the majority of the song could have made it a sleepy R B song, but noted that the inevitable high note saves it from becoming so. Jamieson Cox of Time echoed Garibaldi's sentiments, writing It's a gaseous, fluffy ballad that feels like a direct descendant of the song that rang in her mid career renaissance, 2005's mega hit 'We Belong Together' plinking piano melodies, a typically fluttering Carey vocal take, and a very similar beat. Only time will tell if 'You're Mine Eternal ' can duplicate that song's record breaking success . Melinda Newman of HitFix questioned if Carey could have achieve success with the song, describing it as breathless and too reliant on the singer's vocal pyrotechnics . She continued to write that the song would most probably not achieve any success on the Billboard Hot 100, but would find some love on the adult contemporary and R B radio stations. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse compared the production of the song to Carey's previous singles Always Be My Baby 1995 and Touch My Body 2008 . He also wrote that the drawn out whistle at the end of the song was impressive . Carolyn Menyes for Music Times felt that Songz overshadowed Carey with his vocals on the urban remix. Slant Magazine writer Alexa Camp thought that while Carey's voice sounded good, Darkchild's production was utterly trivial . She concluded by expressing that the remix featuring Songz was slightly more interesting . In the United Kingdom, You're Mine Eternal spent one week on the UK Singles Chart, debuting at number 87 on February 16, 2014, just four days after being released. It fared better on the UK R B Chart, spending one week at number 16. In Hungary, the song reached the top twenty, peaking at number 14, and the top 30 in Spain, reaching number 21.

Carey explained how she created the concept for the video and the decided to being in Ingrain to direct specific scenes in a radio interview I would say it was a directorial collaborative effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was I love Puerto Rico it's one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way ... I like a lot of the shots in the video ... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, they're ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me. Scenes of the music video include Carey sitting beside a river in the forest covered in gold glitter, sitting in front of waterfalls and tropical wildlife, and imitating a mermaid by swimming underwater while wearing an evening gown.

You're Not Sorry was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, He came across as prince charming. As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was, she said.

The song is set in common time and has a slow tempo of 67.5 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E minor and Swift's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to C4. The musical arrangement contains a prominent hook during its chorus, according to Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine. You're Not Sorry commences with piano and, mid song, progresses toward backing electric guitars, which eventually reach a solo. Martens believed Swift's vocals were not the strongest because the existence of the electric guitar solo was meant to prevent too many high notes. It follows the chord progression EmCGD.

Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said You're Not Sorry was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade , and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, And indeed, we think we got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' ... It isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses, despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette compared You're Not Sorry to a chanteuse a la Tori Amos . As it was not released as a double single, You're Not Sorry did not receive airplay, thus its chart appearances consisted mainly of digital downloads. The song entered Billboard's Hot Digital Songs Chart at number two, which led to an appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending November 15, 2008.

Midway through You're Not Sorry , Swift ceases playing the piano and commences to sing a cover version of Justin Timberlake's What Goes Around... ...Comes Around while whipping her hair, maintaining on the bench. Throughout the remainder of the performance, she intermingled between the two songs as smoke swirled and lightning was projected on the stage. Jon Pareles of The New York Times referred to the performance as one of the night's highlights at the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Reed Fischer of Miami New Times attended the March 7, 2010, concert at BankAtlantic Center in Sunrise, Florida and, of the cover of What Goes Around... ...Comes Around , said, That, and some extended beating on an oil drum sculpture, made for the only unsavory moments of the night. Alice Fisher of the United Kingdom magazine The Observer believed the performance at the May 7, 2009, concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, England was undermined by the way Swift writhed on her stool and awkwardly thumped the piano lid in one of the most unconvincing displays of passion I've seen since Footballers' Wives finished. Swift also performed the song at an exclusive performance, hosted by 95.8 Capital FM, the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, and the 2009 CMA Music Festival. During her Speak Now World Tour, she used elements of You're Not Sorry and Apologize while performing Back To December .

The song was written and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, with additional songwriting provided by Ferreira and Daniel Nigro. It was released as the album's lead single on September 24, 2013 by Capitol Records. The song was well received by critics, who cited it as a standout track from its parent album and praised its overall sound. Grant Singer directed a music video for the track, which was released in September 2013. The song has been performed by Ferreira on several live events, some of which were television shows. You're Not the One was written in 2012, at a time whenaccording to Ferreirashe was in a different headspace . I had been dating someone for three years, since I was 17, and that person guarded me from everything , she said. Ferreira explained that her life was essentially limited to modelling, crafting songs and watch TV , which resulted in her not having a chance to discover self. The track was recorded in 2013 by Ariel Rechtshaid, at the Heavy Duty Studios in Los Angeles. Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen produced the track, contributed towards its instrumentation and provided background vocals for the song. The two played the keyboard while they were accompanied by Daniel Nigro when playing the electric guitar Rechtshaid played the bass and Garrett Ray helmed the drums. During post production, David Schiffman mixed the song and Emily Lazar mastered it. During a July 2013 interview with Glamour, Ferreira announced that the track would serve as the lead single from an upcoming extended playwhich ultimately became her debut album Night Time, My Time. The single cover for You're Not the One was revealed on September 9, 2013, and the song itself was released 15 days later, on September 24. An official remix of the track by producer Cid Rim was released online in March 2014 a commercial release of that remix, packaged with three others in a digital EP format, followed in June. In 2015, the Blood Diamonds remix of the song was featured in the commercial for Jimmy Choo's fragrance Illicit. You're Not the One displays a fusion of pop and indie rock styles while incorporating electropop as well. Ferreira stated that she conceptualized the track as a super poppy version of David Bowie's eleventh studio album Low 1977 she was told that the song itself resembles the works of singer songwriter Siouxsie Sioux. Its instrumentation is marked by the mixture of pounding, crude percussion and electric guitar riffs, accompanied with tinny six stringer scrapes . Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club described its sonority as having gothic overtones and being a homage to the late 80s works of band The Cure. The songs' lyrics were written by Ferreira, Rechtshaid, Raisen and Nigro they depict a relationship in which two love partners do not express sufficient mutual interest, due to the fact that they do not pursue each other. The Washington Post's Lavanya Ramanathan dubbed the song a breakup tune and wrote that in it, Ferreira embodies a teenager with guy problems . For CMJ, Brooke Segarra billed the track as a sexually assertive number and interpreted the song's lyrical theme as listing the mistakes and shortcomings that come with sex . Elias Leight of PopMatters wrote that a recurring theme in the albumalso represented in You're Not the One is Ferreira's rejection of the opposite sex . The song's official remix, produced by Cid Rim, removes the pop rock edge of the song in favor of an electronica and hip hop influenced sound. In this version, the verses display handclaps underneath Ferreira's vocals, which are more pitched than in the original and cut up as well. Carl Williott of Idolator billed it as an intriguing listen . You're Not the One received positive feedback from contemporary music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic selected the song as one of Night Time, My Time's stronger tracks, as did Digital Spy's Lewis Corner the latter elaborated that it continues the premise that has finally emerged as an artist who knows what she wants . Bryant Kitching from Consequence of Sound deemed it a musical highlight from the album. Comparing the song's guitar led opening to Johnny Marr on a sugar rush , he also called it the album's most rewarding moment . Writing for magazine Spin, Marc Hogan echoed praise for the songhe described it as impressively catchy and emotionally communicative and also said it was the type of track that might inspire a label to green lightfinallyher debut album . musicOMH's Nina Bertok highlighted the song's mixture of genres and catchiness, and also praised the killer chorus. The staff of The Guardian listed You're Not the One as the eighteenth best track of 2013, whereas Melissa Locker of Time, who made a similar list, included the song as the nineteenth best of that year. The official music video for You're Not the One was directed by Grant Singer, and written and co produced by V magazine senior editor Patrik Sandberg. Ferreira announced plans to shoot a visual for the track in July 2013, and stated that Singer would direct it. According to Singer, the video took nine months to craft it was originally supposed to be filmed in Berlin so it had a Christiane F. vibe , however this did not occur due to unknown reasons. Sandberg suggested the twist ending and the use of an ice pick, which he thought should be used as a narrative tool instead of just a prop. Singer described the overall video as sinister and pop . The video was filmed at The Lash, a nightclub in Los Angeles, where Ferreira is seen dancing in front of multicolored lasers. The video, especially the opening sequence, is direct homage to the 1983 movie The Hunger starring David Bowie, and follows the same color and light choices, camera angles, and general storytelling of the movie's opening scene. The video begins with Ferreira walking towards a blue projector screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black jacket and a transparent, fishnet pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly as a group of voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that manher apparent love interestas they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man whispers in her ear, while this catches her love interest's attention, implying jealousy if not competition. The latter walks away and finds the woman he arrived with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, the man, who is lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word not , dripping blood as well. Spin's Marc Hogan found the video too focused on Ferreira's model abilities to complement the song effectively . Ferreira had already been performing You're Not the One before its formal releaseat her concert on the last day of the 2013 Pitchfork Music Festival, she sang it as the ninth track of her setlist. After the song's digital release, she promoted it on television shows and radio lounges. On November 26, 2013 she sang the track during an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman, where she wore opaque black sunglasses and a black blazer over a sheer top . Ferreira, who opened the American leg of Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour, included the song in her setlist for those concerts. On February 27, 2014as she was on an interruption from the tourFerreira performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Dressed in a leather jacket, shades and with her hair wet, she was praised by Ben Kaye from Consequence of Sound for her dazzling rendition of the song. You're Not the One was later performed on March 12 of that year on a BBC Radio 1 session.

A live performance was held at the 2014 SF Sketchfest, also positively received. You're Whole is presented as a parody of self help infomercials. Each episode is advertised as part of a larger DVD set, consisting of 27 discs. The show features Michael Ian Black as the host, Randall Tyree Mandersohn a totally blind , volleyball obsessed, self help guru. Along with his wife, Pam Cathy Shim , Mandersohn aims to help people using his bizarre, convoluted systems of objects and actions. The show was directed by Michael Showalter, a longtime collaborator of Black. Actor Crista Flanagan indicated that the second season was filmed as recently as August 2013. In a June 2014 interview with the Detroit Metro Times, Black stated that no further seasons would be produced. Writing retrospectively the amount of research put into the show, Black stated that he didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it , as it would have spoiled some of the stupidity , joking that I'm nothing if not stupid . Abominable Pictures producer David Soldinger later wrote that Black had come to the company with the idea in mind, and that, with their other parody infomercial Swords, Knives, Very Sharp Objects and Cutlery, it was a happy marriage between their company and Adult Swim. A live performance of the show was given at the 2014 SF Sketchfest on January 31. In addition to acting, Black and Showalter interlaced it with clips from the show. Art Siriwatt of The Daily Californian observed Showalter to be the straight man to Black's antics, with both frequently breaking character. He gave the performance a positive review, writing that the result was a concise, lighthearted performance that was faithful to the show. The show premiered on November 5, 2012 on Adult Swim two seasons have been broadcast, totaling eight episodes. Advertised as a series of genuine infomercials, both seasons were broadcast at 4 a.m., as part of the network's DVR Theater block. The early morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours. The first episode was published on YouTube the day after its premiere. One criticEliot Glazer of Vulturecalled the early morning time slot terrible , directing readers toward online distribution. Although the show premiered during a graveyard slot in U.S. dayparting, nearly one million viewers 993,000 saw it on air. The second season premiere marked a slight increase in viewers 996,000 , while both maintained a Nielsen rating of 0.7. Critical reception was positive, with many reviewers praising Black's performance and the satirizing of American self help gurus, as conveyed through his casual racism and cultural appropriation of foreign rituals. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club found that the show conveys itself in a manner familiar to anyone who's ever killed time before daylight by flipping through their cable package. Britt Hayes of ScreenCrush called the show absolutely fantastic and Black's portrayal spot on . Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate wrote that Black's performance was wonderfully committed , while the show has pretty much every common trope of the self help craze covered , citing the appropriation of foreign customs for Western audiences as perhaps the most scathing treatment . Meanwhile, Kelly West of Television Blend highlighted some of the more surreal systems, calling the diet in the premiere episode a winner . For Splitsider, Bradford Evans dubbed the show a more mainstream version of Paid Programming, an unsuccessful pilot that was also pitched as a mock infomercial. He found that starring Black, recognizable as a comedic actor, would lead to its success, whereas the former preferred to use unknown actors instead.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re%20Whole
"Kevin Edmund Youkilis jukls born March 15, 1979 , also known as Youk juk , is an American former professional baseball first baseman and third baseman, who primarily played for the Boston Red Sox. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, he was drafted by the Red Sox in 2001, after playing college baseball at the University of Cincinnati. He played in Major League Baseball MLB for the Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox, and the New York Yankees. He is currently a special assistant to the Chicago Cubs and former Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Known for his ability to get on base, while he was still a minor leaguer, Youkilis was nicknamed Euclis The Greek God of Walks in the best selling book, Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. A Gold Glove Award winning first baseman, he once held baseball's record for most consecutive errorless games at first base later broken by Casey Kotchman . He is also a three time MLB All Star, two time World Series Champion, and winner of the 2008 Hank Aaron Award. An intense performer on the playing field, Youkilis was known for his scrappiness, grittiness, dirt stained jerseys, home plate collisions, and his strange batting stance. He excelled despite a physique that led many observers to underestimate his athletic ability. He was called roly poly by his high school coach, pudgy by his college coach, a fat kid by general manager Billy Beane, and a thicker bodied guy by the Red Sox scout who recruited him. As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the Boston Globe He does not look like an MVP candidate more a refrigerator repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value hardware store. Youkilis was named to the Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 36 on the list in 2009, No. 38 in 2010, and No. 35 in 2011. Youkilis' Jewish great great great grandfather, a native of 19th century Romania, moved to Greece at the age of 16 to avoid conscription at the hands of the notoriously anti Semitic Cossacks. He became homesick, however, and returned to Romania after a couple of years, although he changed his surname from Weiner to Youkilis to avoid army and jail. Youkilis was born in Cincinnati, the son of Carolyn nee Weekley and Mike Youkilis, a wholesale jeweler. His father was born to a Jewish family, while his mother, a native of West Virginia, converted to Judaism after her marriage. Youkilis has described his father as a well known third baseman in the Jewish Community Center fast pitch softball league. Youkilis is Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah at a Conservative synagogue. At the age of 14, he had an uncredited one line speaking role in the romantic comedy film Milk Money. He attended Sycamore High School in the northeastern suburbs of Cincinnati, where he played third base, shortstop, first base, and the outfield for the school team which won the Amateur Athletic Union National Championship in 1994. While at Sycamore High School, he was the only player to homer off his future Red Sox teammate Aaron Cook. When he graduated from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1 . He was recruited by two Division I schools Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 1246 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody , said Cleary. I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had. While majoring in finance, Youkilis excelled as a player for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. I take no credit , said Cleary. He coaches himself. He knows his swing. Any time we said anything to him, he was already a step ahead. He made the adjustments he had to make. I just think he's a really smart guy who had a great feel for what he had to do. In his junior year in 2000, he was a second team All American and first team All Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season still, he went undrafted. He was kind of a square shaped body, a guy in a uniform didn't look all that athletic , Cleary said. He wasn't a tall, prospect y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. I think the body did scare some people away. During the period between his junior and senior years, he played in the Cape Cod League for the Bourne Braves, finishing sixth in the league in batting average. In his senior year in 2001 he repeated as second team All American. He set UC career records for home runs 56 , walks 206 , slugging percentage .627 , and on base percentage .499 with a batting average of .366. He had a great eye ... he hardly ever struck out looking , said Brad Meador, UC's associate head coach. When he did, you knew the ump missed the call. Cleary, noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed, told his father Your son's going to be a millionaire some day. I don't know if it's in baseball, but he's going to make some money one of these days. Youkilis was later inducted into UC's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame. Yet, when asked what he liked about Youkilis, former Boston scout Matt Haas said At first glance, not a lot. He was unorthodox. He had an extreme crouchhis thighs were almost parallel to the ground. And he was heavier than he is now. But the more I watched him, the more I just thought, 'Throw the tools out the window. This guy can play baseball.' In 2001, at Haas' urging, the Boston Red Sox drafted Youkilis in the eighth round 243rd overall , to the chagrin of Billy Beane, who had hoped that he would be able to draft him in a later round. ESPN reported that questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft. He signed for a mere 12,000 signing bonus. Kevin would have played for a six pack of beer , his father said. Teams didnt appreciate performance as much then as they do now , observed Red Sox VP of Player Personnel Ben Cherington eight years later. His college performance was off the charts. If he in the draft this year, he'd be at least a sandwich pick, if not a first rounder. His performance was that good, in college and on the Cape. Now, teams appreciate what that means. There's no way hed last that long now. In 2001, Youkilis made his professional debut as a third baseman with the Lowell Spinners, a Short Season A Class franchise in the New YorkPenn League. He went on to lead the league with a .512 OBP, 52 runs, and 70 walks against just 28 strikeouts , while hitting for a .317 batting average third in the league in 59 games. He also reached base safely by hit or walk in 46 consecutive games the third longest such streak in the minor leagues . Peter Gammons wrote that August Remember this name Kevin Youkilis, who resembles Steve Balboni. Honored by the Spinners with a Youkilis bobblehead night , Youkilis said It's an honoryou know you've made it when you get a bobblehead of yourself. Promoted from Lowell towards the end of the season, he played five games with the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Low A Class league. He was named Red Sox Minor League Player of the Year. In 2002, Youkilis appeared in 15 games for Augusta, in 76 games for the Sarasota Sox 40 of them at first base , and in 44 games for the Trenton Thunder. He hit .310, with eight home runs and 80 RBIs for the year, and he was voted Trenton's Player of the Year. His .436 on base percentage was the fifth highest in the minors in 2002, and his 80 walks were seventh most. In recognition of his performance, the Boston Red Sox named Youkilis their 2002 Minor League Player of the Year. After the 2002 season, Boston's then assistant general manager, Theo Epstein, sent Youkilis to the Athletes' Performance Institute in Tempe, Arizona, where he engaged in an intensive six week training regimen. Youkilis then moved his off season home to Arizona, and attended the Institute in the 200408 off seasons as well. In 2003, Youkilis started the season with the Portland Sea Dogs. In 94 games, he led the Eastern League with a .487 on base percentage best all time for the team through 2007 , and was third in the league with a .327 batting average second best all time for the team through 2007 . 86 walks against just 40 strikeouts , and a .953 OPS, and tied for third with 16 hit by pitch. Later, he earned a spot on the Eastern League All Star team, the Baseball America AA All Star team, and on the U.S. roster for the 2003 All Star Futures Game. After Portland, Youkilis moved up to play for the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Boston Red Sox Class AAA franchise. During his time with Pawtucket, Youkilis managed to complete a streak he started while in Portland he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate Kevin Millar's minor league record for consecutive games reaching base. His 104 walks were the third highest number recorded in the minors in 2003. Asked, however, about the focus in position playing baseball on five tool players, Youkilis quipped, I don't even know if I have a tool. Writing for ESPN, John Sickels evaluated him as follows in mid 2003 Youkilis is an on base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is adept at working counts and out thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and breaking pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, and he may never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 1014 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, and is likely to end up at first base down the road. Youkilis spent the 200304 winter in Mexico, playing for Navojoa of the Mexican Pacific League. In 2004, he appeared in 32 games for Pawtucket, hitting .258 with three home runs, and a .347 on base percentage, before being called up to the Red Sox on May 15. In his minor league career through 2005, he batted .299 with a .442 OBP while playing 340 games at third base, 59 at first base, and 2 at second base. Youkilis, on the dedication of the Red Sox fans On May 15, 2004, when Red Sox regular starting third baseman Bill Mueller was placed on the disabled list, Youkilis was called up for the first time. I didn't sleep much , Youkilis said. I got about four hours of sleep. ... They told me the night before I was playing.... I got in there, and man, I was just amped up and excited. During his first major league game in Toronto, with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout, Youkilis in his second at bat homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game. As a prank, the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment when he returned to the dugout after his homer. This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life , he said. Later, Youkilis was swept up in the team's ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters waitress outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. I walked into the locker room, and all my clothes were gone , Youkilis said. There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes. Youkilis was named the American League AL Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a .446 OBP as he batted .318 with 7 RBIs, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said I'm staying in the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled. In mid July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again towards the end of the season. On September 24, which was Yom Kippur, Youkilis appeared in the dugout in uniform, but declined to participate in the game out of deference to the religious holiday. Youkilis was named the club's Rookie of the Year by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. For the season, in 44 games, he saw an average of 4.67 pitches per plate appearance, first among major leaguers with at least 90 plate appearances. As Youkilis observed, Fighting off pitches, fouling off pitches, laying off pitches, making it so the opposing pitcher can't breathe that's my job. He was on the roster for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series ALDS , making his sole appearance in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels. It's been an unbelievable ride , Youkilis said. It's a great first year, a year you probably can't top. Hopefully, it ends like a Cinderella story. He was removed from the roster for the next round, the American League Championship Series ALCS , and was on the roster but did not play in the World Series. While virtually nobody else knew it, Youkilis broke his toe during spring training in 2005, and was back playing again in a matter of days. It was in Vero Beach , Youkilis said. I was trying to make the team. On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for the first time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to activate Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call upprompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practiceone August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play. He ultimately played 43 more games for Pawtucket in 2005 before being called up permanently. On September 18, he fractured the tip of the ring finger of his right hand fielding a ground ball, and did not play again until October 2, the final day of the regular season. In 2005 with Boston, Youkilis hit .278 with a .400 on base percentage in 79 at bats in 44 games during five stints with the team. He saw an average of 4.68 pitches per plate appearance, the most of any Red Sox player with at least 50 at bats. He made 23 appearances at third base, 9 at first base, and 2 at second, and batted at least once from all nine spots in the batting order. In 2006, his first full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman with 127 games at first . Until that time, he was primarily a third baseman, though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 he played in the outfield for the first time in his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield. Youkilis tied for the major league lead in sacrifice flies 11 , and led the AL with 4.43 pitches per plate appearance and by hitting line drives 24 of time that he put balls in play. Also that year, Youkilis finished second in the AL in pitches seen 3,009 and percent of pitches taken 63.8 , 4th in OBP with runners in scoring position with two outs .524 , 7th in bases on balls 91 the six players ahead of him averaged 41 home runs and 14 intentional walks, while Youkilis hit only 13 homers and was not intentionally walked once , tied for 7th in bases taken 22 advanced on fly balls, passed balls, wild pitches, balks, etc. , 8th in doubles 42 and batting average with runners in scoring position with two out .375 , 9th in walk percentage 13.8 , and 10th in times on base 259 . He scored 100 runs, hit for a .325 batting average with runners in scoring position, and hit four first inning leadoff home runs. He did this despite struggling in the second half of the season with plantar fasciitis and a problematic abdominal muscle. Youkilis had a career high 23 game hitting streak starting on May 5, 2007, and ending on June 2, 2007, in which he hit .426 43101 with 13 doubles, 6 HRs, 21 RBIs, and a .468 OBP. At one point during the hitting streak, he had 9 straight games with at least two hits tying a Red Sox record set by Jim Rice in 1978 , and became the first Red Sox hitter since Trot Nixon to hit an inside the park home run. During the hitting streak, on May 20, he hit what would be the shortest homer by a Sox player during the seasona 321 foot homer around the Pesky Pole. The home run would not have cleared the fence at any of the other 29 ballparks in baseball. Although the hit streak ended on June 2, he did walk three times in an 116 win over the Yankees. His manager Terry Francona said, He's taking more of what the pitchers give him, using the whole field. He's going to work the count about as good as any hitter in baseball. Last year if he got a two strike breaking ball, he might swing and miss. This year he's fouling it off, or taking it to right field. On June 1, Yankees pitcher Scott Proctor hit Youkilis in the head with a pitch Proctor was ejected from the game. On August 30, Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain threw a pair of 98 mph pitches over Youkilis's head Chamberlain was ejected, and later also suspended two games for inappropriate actions. That's the second time , Youkilis observed. Scott Proctor hit me in the head. Coincidence I don't know. It doesn't look good. On June 25, 2007, Youkilis played in his 120th consecutive game at first base without an error, breaking the prior Red Sox record set in 1921 by Stuffy McInnis. On September 7, he played in his 179th consecutive game at first base without an error, which broke the prior AL record set in 1973 by Mike Hegan. On September 15, Yankees pitcher Chien Ming Wang struck Youkilis on his right wrist with a pitch, resulting in a deep tendon bruise that kept him out until September 25, when he returned with the aid of a cortisone shot. In 2007, Youkilis was 6th in the AL with 15 hit by pitch HBP . Youkilis's error less streak at the end of the regular season was 190 games while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16, 2007, playoff game against the Cleveland Indians, postseason games are not included in the record. Youkilis said, I'm not worried about making the error. I'm worried about trying to help the team win and trying to get an out any way we can. Leading the league with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, and an AL record 1,079 error less chances at first, Youkilis won the 2007 AL Gold Glove award for first basemen. While he batted .288 for the season, with men on base, he hit .340 with a .435 OBP. He was 6th in the league in pitches per plate appearance 4.27 and in hit by pitch 15 . In the first inning of Game 1 of the ALDS against the Angels he hit his first post season home run. It was his first homer since returning from being hit by Wang, and Youkilis said his wrist felt a lot better as the days have progressed. I think the best thing about it is that it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most. In the 7 game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004 , and scored 10 runs bettering Matsui's 2004 ALCS record while batting .500 another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone's .455 in 1986 with a .576 OBP and a .929 slugging percentage. Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did not start the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120 RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117 RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it the most difficult decision any American League manager has had to make in the 34 year history of the DH . Youkilis said, It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just the way it has to be. Youkilis hit two doubles both in Game 1 and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4 game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, Move on and go to another team if youre worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else. Youkilis was selected the 2007 recipient of the Jackie Jensen Award for spirit and determination by the Boston BBWAA chapter. In 2007, Youkilis had earned 424,500, the fourth lowest salary on the club. In February 2008, he signed a one year contract for 3 million, avoiding salary arbitration. In March 2008, his role as the designated player representative of the Red Sox became known during the resolution of a player management dispute regarding non payment of coaches and staff for the Red Sox trip to Japan. On April 2, 2008, on an unassisted game ending play against the Oakland A's, Youkilis broke the Major League record for most consecutive error less games by a first baseman, previously held by Steve Garvey, at 194 games. In his 205th game without an error on April 27, Youkilis also established a new major league record for first basemen, when he fielded his 1,701st consecutive chance without an error, passing the old mark of 1,700 set by Stuffy McInnis from 1921 to 1922. His streak, which started on July 4, 2006, was snapped at 238 games 2,002 fielding attempts on June 7, 2008 against the Seattle Mariners. He was named AL Player of the Week for May 511, after batting .375 while leading the AL with five home runs, and tying for the American League lead with 10 RBIs. In an early June game at Fenway Park, one camera reportedly showed Manny Ramirez taking a swing at Youkilis, and the two had to be separated by teammates in the Red Sox dugout. I think they were just exchanging some views on things , manager Terry Francona said. We had a lot of testosterone going tonight. Asked about the incident the following year, Youkilis said We have two different approaches to the game. Winning and losing isnt life and death to Manny. He was the AL's starter at first base on the 2008 AL All Star team that played the 79th Major League Baseball All Star Game at Yankee Stadium, voted in by the fans with 2,858,130 votes in his first year on the ballot. Youkilis became the sixth Red Sox first baseman to start an All Star Game at first base, following Jimmie Foxx 1938 40 , Walt Dropo 1950 , Mickey Vernon 1956 , George Scott 1966 , and Mo Vaughn 1996 . In late July, Manny Ramirez was traded away by the Red Sox. Youkilis took over the cleanup spot of the lineup. In 2008, Youkilis led the AL in at bats per RBI 4.7 , was 3rd in slugging percentage .569 and sacrifice flies 9 , 4th in RBIs 115 , extra base hits 76 , and OPS .958 5th in hit by pitch 12 6th in batting average .312 and on base percentage .390 7th in doubles 43 and in times advanced from first to third on a single 14 8th in total bases 306 , 10th in at bats per home run 18.6 , and 12th in home runs 29 . He was also 2nd in extra base hit percentage 12.2 of all plate appearances . Youkilis also batted .356 against relief pitchers, .358 with men on base, and .374 with runners in scoring position. He drew seven intentional walks during the 2008 season, the first season he had garnered any, and also led the AL with a .353 batting average after the sixth inning. Youkilis became just the third modern major leaguer since 1901 ever to bat over .300 with more than 100 RBIs during a season in which he spent at least 30 games at both first and third base St. Louis' Albert Pujols 2001 and Cleveland's Al Rosen 1954 are the only other players to accomplish the feat. Youkilis finished third in the balloting for the 2008 AL MVP Award, receiving two first place votes one from Evan Grant of The Dallas Morning News , while his teammate Dustin Pedroia won and Justin Morneau came in second. Only Youkilis and Morneau were named on all ballots. In the ALCS Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays, the Red Sox were down by seven runs in the bottom of the seventh inning. Youkilis scored the winning run for the Red Sox to complete the second largest comeback in MLB postseason history. Before Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, he was named the winner of the AL Hank Aaron Award for the best offensive performance of the 2008 season. Youkilis signed a four year, 41.25 million contract with the Red Sox on January 15, 2009. The deal also included a team option at 14 million, with a 1.25 million buyout for 2013. Later that year, he was voted 36 on the Sporting News list of the 50 greatest active baseball players, voted on by a panel that included members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Youkilis batted cleanup for Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, tying for the lead among all WBC players in home runs 3 and runs 9 , and tying for second on the team in RBIs 6 and walks 6 , through the first two rounds. He had to leave the team with a left ankle sprain, however, before the WBC semifinals. Youkilis hit a walk off home run against the Yankees on April 24, 2009. He has skills, man , said David Ortiz. I don't know how he do it. He just do it. He was subsequently placed on the disabled list a few days later, but returned to play on May 20. It's frustrating not being able to play , he said. Watching baseball is not something I like to do. Youkilis was picked to be a reserve on the AL 2009 All Star team by Tampa Bay and AL manager Joe Maddon, after coming in second in the fan vote to Mark Teixeira, 3,309,050 to 3,069,906. On August 6, 2009, with the Red Sox suffering numerous injuries, Youkilis played left field for the first time since he played 18 games there in 2006. On August 8, he again played left field, and made a couple of twists and turns on a fly ball hit by Johnny Damon before committing an error. On August 11, 2009, after 6' 5 pitcher Rick Porcello of the Detroit Tigers hit him in the back with an 89 mph pitch, Youkilis immediately charged Porcello on the mound. Youkilis threw his helmet at the fast back pedaling Porcello, and Porcello tackled Youkilis, both went down, and both benches cleared. Both players were tossed from the game, and each received a five game suspension. Hearing that his friend and former minor league teammate Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer at the age of 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend's memory. After inscribing GM in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. That was for him , Youkilis said. There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things. In 2009, Youkilis was 2nd in the AL in OBP .413 and OPS .961 , 4th in hit by pitch 16 , 5th in slugging percentage .548 , and batted .305 overall and .362 with runners in scoring position. He also led the AL in pitches per plate appearance 4.42 , was 6th in batting average on balls in play .363 , and 10th in walk percentage 13.6 . Statistically, if you consider 2008 and 2009, you could make the case there has been no better player in the league , said Red Sox EVP Epstein. Of the players with 1,000 plate appearances in the AL over the 200809 seasons, none had a higher OPS than Youkilis .960 . In the field, while Youkilis split his time primarily between first base and third base and therefore did not qualify for the fielding percentage title at either, his .998 fielding percentage in 78 games at first matched that of the league leader Lyle Overbay, and his .974 fielding percentage in 63 games at third base was better than league leader Melvin Mora's .971. Youkilis finished sixth in balloting for the 2009 AL MVP Award, receiving two second place votes. He was selected as the Red Sox most valuable player winner of the 2009 Thomas A. Yawkey Memorial Award in voting by the Boston Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. In 2010, Youkilis was again named to Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 38 on the list. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list. On May 18, 2010, Youkilis hit his 100th career home run off CC Sabathia. On August 2, Youkilis' season was cut short by a right thumb abductor muscle tear, which he had played through for two weeks. At the time of his injury, he was tied for 3rd in the major leagues in runs scored 77 , and led all major leaguers with a .798 slugging percentage against left handed pitchers. He was 3rd in the AL in on base percentage .411 , tied for 5th in walks 58 , tied for 7th in extra base hits 50 , 8th in slugging percentage .564 , and 9th in total bases 204 . He had surgery to repair the tear on August 6. The injury limited him to only 102 games for the season, his fewest since his 2005 sophomore year. Slowed by his injury, he had only 362 at bats, but batted .307 .411 .564 with 19 home runs and 62 RBIs. For the years 200810, his .964 OPS ranked second in the major leagues, behind Albert Pujols 1.074 . During the offseason the Red Sox acquired All Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, and with the imminent departure of Adrian Beltre, Youkilis agreed to the make the switch back to third base. In 2011, Youkilis was again named to Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 35 on the list. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list. Youkilis was named a reserve for the 82nd All Star Game. At the All Star break, he was 3rd in the league in doubles 26 , 4th in on base percentage .399 , 6th in RBIs 63 , 7th in OPS .911 , and 9th in walks 49 . For the season, he led all AL third basemen in fielding percentage, at .967. However, he batted only .258, his lowest MLB season average of his career. The Red Sox suffered a collapse late in the 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not pitch in the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis was the source of this information, alienating him from his teammates. On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine publicly questioned Youkilis' motivation and physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine began to play Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay 5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto. The next day, Youkilis started for the White Sox, playing against the Minnesota Twins. He went 14 with a single in a loss. He hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox on July 3, against the Texas Rangers off of Roy Oswalt. He also went 36 with 4 RBIs in that game. On July 9, 2012 Youkilis was named the American League Player of the Week, after batting .478 with three home runs and ten RBIs in a 51 span for the White Sox. White Sox manager Robin Ventura reported that Youkilis was a competitor with a grinder mentality , who fit in well with his White Sox teammates. For the season, he batted .235 .336 .409 with 19 home runs and 60 RBIs, and tied for the major league lead in hit by pitch, with 17. He became a free agent after the 2012 season. On December 11, Youkilis accepted a one year contract worth 12 million to play third base for the New York Yankees. Though Youkilis had not been popular with members of the Yankees and their fans, Robinson Cano and Alex Rodriguez publicly supported the signing, and Joba Chamberlain reached out to Youkilis in an attempt to smooth over their past differences. The deal became official on December 14. Youkilis was diagnosed with a back strain when the 2013 season began and was placed on the 15 day disabled list on April 30, 2013. He was activated and returned on May 30, 2013. He was placed back on the disabled list on June 14, 2013 after restraining his back. He then underwent season ending surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on June 20, 2013. Youkilis agreed to a one year, 4 million contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2014 season. He missed part of the season due to plantar fasciitis. In 21 games, Youkilis batted .215 with one home run with 11 RBIs. On October 30, 2014, Youkilis announced his retirement from baseball. In February 2015, Youkilis was hired by his former GM Theo Epstein as a scout and development consultant for the Chicago Cubs. In August 2016, Youkilis, along with his brother Scott, purchased the Los Gatos Brewing Company, and re opened it as the Loma Brewing Company, a brewpub in Los Gatos, California. The brewery was subsequently named as the 2017 California Commercial Beer Brewery of the Year. Youkilis was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5 of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot. Michael Lewis's 2003 best seller Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game focuses on Oakland Athletics' General Manager Billy Beane's use of Sabermetrics as a tool in the evaluation of potential prospects. In the book, Lewis discusses then prospect Youkilis in detail, and refers to him as Euclis, the Greek God of Walks , a moniker that has stuck. Beane put more stock in empirical evidence than in scouts' hunches, and did not care that Youkilis was pudgy or, as Lewis put it in the book, a fat third baseman who couldn't run, throw, or field , but just loved his ability to get on base helped in no small part by the ballplayer's 20 11 vision . The book brought minor leaguer Youkilis his first national recognition. former Red Sox manager Terry Francona, referring to his nickname, the Greek God of Walks Lewis also revealed that Beane repeatedly tried to trade for Youkilis before Youkilis reached the major leagues, but his attempts were blocked by then Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Asked by a reporter what he thought of the nickname, Youkilis quipped, It's better than being 'the Greek God of Illegitimate Children.' But according to his father, Kevin disliked that 'Greek God of Walks' stuff. As has been pointed out by others, the name is inaccurate anyway, as Youklis is of Romanian extraction, not Greek. Fans actually rooted for Youkilis to take pitches. It was frustrating to hear fans say, 'Get a walk ' Youkilis said. I'll take a walka walk's as good as a hitbut don't you want me to hit a home run or something On August 8, 2005, while playing for the Red Sox, Youkilis took the field in the 9th inning along with Adam Stern and Gabe Kapler, setting a record for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in AL history, and the most in Major League Baseball history since four Jewish players took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941. Youkilis was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published in affiliation with Fleer Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society, commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Ryan Braun, Brad Ausmus, Ian Kinsler, Brian Horwitz, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis. He was one of three Jewish players in the 2008 All Star Game, joining Braun and Kinsler, and one of three Jewish players on the Team USA 2009 World Baseball Classic team, joining Braun and Grabow. Kinsler says that Youkilis always says something to me on the bases. 'Happy Passover,' he'll throw something at me. Youkilis was named the Jewish MVP for 2008, beating out fellow All Stars Braun and Kinsler. He was voted the top Jewish baseball player of the decade 200009 in online balloting, beating out Shawn Green and Braun. Through the 2017 season, his .382 on base percentage and .478 slugging percentage each placed him 5th on the career all time lists of Jewish major leaguers directly behind Al Rosen and Shawn Green , his 254 doubles, 618 career RBIs, and 539 walks placed him 7th behind Mike Lieberthal for doubles, and behind Al Rosen for RBIs and walks , and his 150 home runs placed him tied for 7th with Lieberthal directly behind Al Rosen . In Jews and Baseball An American Love Story, a 2010 documentary film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted It's something that I probably wont realize until my career is over, how many people are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because I went 3 for 4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people and a lot of the Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had. He expressed interest to play for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic, if healthy. Since the 2013 qualifier was during the regular season, he was unable to compete, but he announced that he would play for the team if they made it past the qualifying round. In an embarrassing formatting oddity, it was noticed in 2007 that multiple baseball websites such as Baseball Reference.com and Baseball Prospectus had been using youkike as part of their urls for webpages featuring Youkilis. This unintended quirk affected those sites that used an automatic url creating algorithm which combined the first five letters of a player's surname with the first two letters of his first name. Following the discovery, the sites manually adjusted the urls to remove the inadvertent ethnic slur. Kevin Youkilis Hits For Kids is a charitable organization established by Youkilis in 2007. Youkilis's foundation focuses on raising support and awareness for the health, advocacy, safety, and medical healing of children across Massachusetts, in his hometown of Cincinnati, and beyond. Rallying the support of volunteers, local business, and the heart of Red Sox Nation, Kevin Youkilis Hits for Kids teams with existing, community based children's charities and medical research efforts that lack sufficient funding and awareness. One organization that Hits for Kids works with is the Joslin Diabetes Center's Pediatric Health Services. He has a special sensitivity about youth suicide, since his college roommate, a close and supportive friend of his since high school, committed suicide on Thanksgiving during his sophomore year. To this day, he said, I sit back at night and wonder what I could've done. In my religion, the Jewish religion, that's one of the biggest things that's taught, is giving a mitzvah, forming a mitzvah , said Youkilis. I was always taught as a kid giving to charity. You're supposed to give a good amount of charity each and every year. ... It's just a great thing when you can make a kid smile that's going through some hard times in life ... I wish more people, not just athletes, would give people just a little bit of their time. It doesn't take much ... It can make a huge difference. After the first game of the ALDS, Youkilis re shaved his head for good luck in a sign of solidarity with cancer patient Mitt Campbell. Following the team's 2007 World Series victory, Youkilis shaved his goatee for a 5,000 donation by Gillette to his foundation. All profits from his charity wine SauvignYoouuk Blanc , released in 2008, support Hits for Kids. In November 2008, Youkilis and Enza Sambataro held a wedding ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, although the couple never formalized their wedding. The ceremony was attended by Red Sox teammates Mike Lowell, David Ortiz, and Dustin Pedroia. Sambataro, a Newton, Massachusetts native, was CEO of Youkilis's charity, Hits for Kids, until the couple split up in 2010. In February 2012, the Boston Herald reported that Youkilis was engaged to Julie Brady, the sister of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Two months later, the couple were quietly married in New York City, and a pregnancy was rumored at that time. Twelve months after the Boston Herald article, the wedded Youkilises, along with their infant son, were featured in a 30 minute program on the YES Network. The family lives in Los Gatos, California. During his tenure with the Red Sox and especially throughout the New England area, the phrase Yoouuuk became a commonplace term being seen on T shirts, bumper stickers, and advertising. The phrase represents Youkilis' nickname but also replicates the phonetic spelling of the low, drawn out, guttural cheer that Red Sox fans in attendance would greet Youkilis with as he walked toward the batter's box prior to hitting or after a successful play in the field. Youkilis made an appearance in season 1 episode 8 of the Travel Channel show Man v. Food. The episode was recorded at Boston's Eagle's Deli and featured Youkilis rooting against host and New York Yankees fan Adam Richman in an eating challenge. In 2011, he appeared in the music video for the Dropkick Murphys song Going Out in Style .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin%20Youkilis
"Young at Heart is the sixteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X Files. It premiered on the Fox network on February 11, 1994. It was written by Scott Kaufer and series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Michael Lange. The episode featured guest appearances by Dick Anthony Williams, William B. Davis and Alan Boyce, and saw Jerry Hardin reprise his role as Deep Throat. The episode is a Monster of the Week story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. Young at Heart earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.2, being watched by 6.8 million households in its initial broadcast and received mostly negative reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. When Mulder and Scully aid a former colleague of Mulder's in an investigation into a series of robberies, it becomes apparent that the culprit is an old nemesis of Mulder'swho had seemingly died in prison several years previously. Young at Heart originated as a script from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, who was a friend of series creator Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, which included the addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Director Michael Lange felt the episode offered him excellent scope to try new techniques, noting that the series producers encourage cinematic stuff . William B. Davis makes his second appearance of the series in this episode, although his role is simply credited as CIA Agent , rather than the more well known Smoking Man . In 1989, Joe Crandall, an inmate at a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania, hears screaming from the infirmary. Inside, he discovers the prison's doctor, Joe Ridley, amputating the hand of fellow inmate John Barnett. Ridley tells Crandall that Barnett is dead, threatening him with a scalpel. However, as Crandall leaves the room, he sees Barnett blinking at him. Four years later, Fox Mulder is notified by his former FBI supervisor, Reggie Purdue, about a note from a jewelry store robbery mocking Mulder by name. Mulder recognizes the message as being from Barnett, a sociopathic multiple murderer whom he helped capture on his first case with the Bureau. Even though Barnett supposedly died in prison, the note bears his handwriting. Purdue shows Dana Scully a video of Barnett's capture, which shows that Mulder didn't fire on Barnett due to him having a hostage, per FBI regulations. Mulder's hesitancy allowed Barnett to kill both the hostage and a fellow agent. Scully looks into Barnett's cause of death and discovers that despite it being listed as heart attack, he had no history of heart problems he had been sent to the infirmary over problems with his hand. Meanwhile, Barnett leaves Mulder another note in his car, along with photos of him and Scully. The agents visit the prison and meet Crandall, who recounts his experiences with Barnett and Ridley. Barnett makes taunting phone calls to Mulder, and strangles Purdue with a disfigured hand. Scully looks into Ridley's past and finds that his medical license was revoked for performing illegal medical trials on children with progeria, a disease that causes premature aging. Mulder theorizes that Ridley's experiments helped him find a way to reverse the aging process. Scully summons Mulder when Ridley suddenly appears at her apartment. He tells the agents that he succeeded in making Barnett age in reverse after replacing his hand using salamander cells. However, Barnett stole Ridley's government sponsored research. Deep Throat meets with Mulder and confirms Ridley's story, saying that the government is negotiating with Barnett to purchase Ridley's work. Scully hears someone dialing into her answering machine and spots Barnett's fingerprint on it. After Barnett calls again, Mulder decides to set up a sting operation at the cello recital for a friend of Scully's, which Barnett learned about from her answering machine. That night, FBI agents wait at the concert hall for Barnett's arrival. Barnett, who goes completely unseen due to his youthful appearance, poses as a piano tuner. He shoots Scully in the chest during the recital and flees, taking the cellist hostage. Mulder doesn't hesitate this time around and fires at Barnett, fatally wounding him. Scully is revealed to have survived the attack, having worn a bullet proof vest. Despite the efforts of doctors and a mysterious CIA agent to resuscitate Barnett, he dies, and takes the secrets of Ridley's research to the grave. The episode ends with a close up of a locker in a train station, implying the secrets along with a bomb planted by Barnett are contained within and will one day be discovered. This episode originated as a script from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, who was an acquaintance of Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, which included the addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett strangles Reggie Purdue, and as a result the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with progeria was filmed after the production crew contacted the Progeria Society and were put in touch with the family of Courtney Arciaga, who was a young girl with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene. Director Michael Lange felt the episode offered him excellent scope to try new techniques, noting that the series producers encourage cinematic stuff . He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand off, explaining that instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, and it was kind of like very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on . William B. Davis makes his second appearance of the series in this episode, although his role is simply credited as CIA Agent , rather than Smoking Man , as per his credit in the pilot episode. The character of Reggie Purdue would later be referenced in the fourth season episode Paper Hearts , and the fifth season episode Unusual Suspects . Young at Heart premiered on the Fox network on February 11, 1994, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on January 12, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.2 with an 11 share, meaning that roughly 7.2 percent of all television equipped households, and 11 percent of households watching TV, were tuned in to the episode. A total of 6.8 million households watched this episode during its original airing. Director Michael Lange said that he liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the original draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more. Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode one of the most emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called far fetched and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as sloppy, poorly edited and thoroughly unexciting , pointing out the forced nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it just wasn't weird enough for an episode of The X Files. Young at Heart has been cited, along with the fourth season episode Paper Hearts , as representing the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends upand goesnowhere .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%20at%20Heart%20%28The%20X-Files%29

"Young Girls is a song by American singer songwriter Bruno Mars. It was composed by Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, a songwriting and record production trio known as The Smeezingtons, as well as Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie, with additional songwriter credits by Mac Davis, for Mars' second studio album Unorthodox Jukebox 2012 . Young Girls is a midtempo, doo wop influenced pop ballad that garnered comparisons to Mars' It Will Rain and Lana Del Rey's music. Its instrumentation includes drums, synths, piano and elements of electro music. Young Girls was released as the first promotional single and later as the fifth overall single from Unorthodox Jukebox, being first serviced to Contemporary hit radio in Australia on November 26, 2013. It received generally mixed to positive reviews. Many music critics noted the complex instrumental and praised Mars' vocals on the record. Its lyrics, detailing the fact of the singer being unable to resist his attraction to young girls, were met with criticism with reviewers calling it a recognizing sin and impassioned shame . The single was recognized as the Best Pop of 2013 at the MelOn Music Awards. Commercially, Young Girls charted in some countries, along with the released of its parent album, such as South Korea, where it reached number one, United Kingdom and Canada. Before it was canceled as the second single it peaked in Australia and New Zealand at 62 and 23, respectively. As the fifth single it reached the position of 19 in Canada and 32 in the United States. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA . The track was performed live on Saturday Night Live and occasionally on the Moonshine Jungle Tour 2013 2015 . During a MTV interview, Mars explained why the track was the first on the track list of the album It really shows you what this album is going to be, and just where I was when I started this album . He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record There's a moment in your life where you start going out every night, and it's so fun, but then you start to lose yourself you get lost in the sauce . The singer compared the song's sentiment to Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places , adding It's another confession . In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you losing yourself , which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life. Mars stated that he felt like an old blues man when writing the song, and wanted to re create the sentiment when some young girls were giving him the runaround . Furthermore, he wasn't willing to stay too far from his roots when it comes to writing lyrics for his album, explaining I'm not there yet...to sing about politics . He concluded that writing and singing songs about girls is what he knows best, I'm not going to preach what I don't know. As much as I love 2 Chainz's All I Want For My Birthday . A demo of the song, only featuring the vocals and an acoustic guitar, was exclusively released as bonus track on the Target edition of the album, on December 11, 2012. Almost a year later, on November 5, 2013, the demo of the song was also included on the deluxe edition of the album, released worldwide. The song was re registered in ASCAP with a new writing credit, Mac Davis. Davis explained he met Jeff Bhasker, who was in the studio with Mars, through Neil Jacobson. Bhasker asked him to come to the studio and at that time they were looking at a rhyme for the chorus. Davis ended up writing the hook. He won a BMI Pop Award in 2015 due to his work on this song. Young Girls was written by Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mac Davis, while production was handled by the former three under their alias, The Smeezingtons, along with Bhasker and Haynie. The song was recorded by Levine at Levcon Studios in Los Angeles and mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California. Charles Moniz served as the track's additional engineer, Brent Kolapalo and Ken Lewis engineered the Big Drums. It was mastered by David Kutch at The Mastering Place. Young Girls was first performed on Saturday Night Live and was released as the first promotional single taken from Unorthodox Jukebox, on November 6, 2012 on iTunes. Later, it was reported by Mars that the record was scheduled to be the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars I felt was good. None of these things are planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You know what I want the world to hear this song that I wrote called 'Young Girls,' and I put it out . However, a week later, while performing When I Was Your Man on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, Young Girls , was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlists on February 26, 2014. Young Girls is a pop song, performed as a woeful midtempo ballad. The pop anthem is also influenced by a groove from Mars' debut studio album, noticeable on the backing vocals, and it contains elements of the shaded earnestness found in It Will Rain . According to the sheet music, the song is composed in the key of A major with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 125 beats per minute. Mars's vocals range spans from the low note of F4 to the high note C6. The song opens with methodical strings mixed with quadruplets, floppy and fuzz wind in the opening bars , along with synths and a piano as Mars' vocal delivery soars . The music progresses with a thumping martial beat on the percussion of the heavy drums , reminding Phil Spector esque tom toms , and they counterpoint to the ascendant melody with bits of electro fading in the background. The chorus would fit in a 60's girl group due to the join forces of Mars' retro crooner sensibilities with modern sonic flourishes . Carl Williot of Idolator noted that the delicate but dynamic production on Young Girls is reminiscent of Lana Del Rey. The lyrics to Young Girls follow the versepre choruschorus pattern. It begins with the singer dumbly trying to get noticed by these bright eyed honeys , since he can't help to fall for their dubious charms , despite recognizing sin while indulging in it . The song's lyrics are in the same vein as Gary Puckett The Union Gap's Young Girl and The Knack's My Sharona as pointed out by HitFix's Melinda Newman. She added, the lyrics are sweet and tortuous as he sings Oh, I still dream of a simple life Boy meets girl makes her his wife But love dont exist when you live like this... All these roads steer me wrong But I still drive them all night long all night long . There is a sentiment of lament in the song, Oh you young wild girls Youll be the death of me . Young Girls debuted to mixed and positive reviews among critics. After its premiere during Mars' performance on Saturday Night Live, it became available as a studio version with Chris Martins of Spin labeling it an epic studio recorded glory . On a more thorough review, Idolator's Carl Williott found the production dynamic comparing it to compositions by Lana Del Rey and while the pre chorus could be from a 60's girl group , the percussion and electro flitting in the background is what makes pop music nowadays. He concluded, that it's a flipside to Mars' lead single. HitFix's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B rating, praising the melody and Mars' vocal delivery, writing he makes it all sound so sweet, and as if he really is tortured by these young girls , but ultimately calling the lyrics a little skeevy . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, while reviewing the album, believed that it swells something serious. The ambition is undeniable . He compared it to the music of U2 and Daughtry. On mixed review, Andy Gill of The Independent, while describing Mars' impassioned shame on the lyrics called the track enjoyable . The lyrics have not gone undecided for PopMatters' Matt Cibula who named them a classic lament and added is as widescreen and wide open as things get these days . The same could be said for Jason Lipshut who, while writing for Billboard, found Mars' recognizing sin while indulging in it on the sleek lyrics and composition. However, a throwback vibe established from the backing vocals remain from Doo Wops , while prospecting the earnest from It Will Rain . On the other hand, Paste's Ryan Reed criticized Mars' for playing safe on Young Girls , unlike most of the other tracks on the album. He explained that the singer steps sideways and the record is a 'shout out to the honeys' belter for various reasons. In 2013, Young Girls received an award at the MelOn Music Awards for the category Best Pop . Young Girls was able to chart in the United States on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which acts as an extension of the Billboard Hot 100, at number 2 and entered at number 64 on the Canadian Hot 100 on November 24, 2012, two weeks after the song was released as a promotional single. Following the release of Unorthodox Jukebox, on December 12, 2012, the track re entered at number 63 on the latter chart, it debuted in France at number 123, in the United Kingdom at number 141 and the song debuted at the top spot on the South Korea International Singles chart. As of 2016, it has sold over 431,878 copies. In Australia, when the record was scheduled to be the second single from the album, it debuted at number 62 and it made its first appearance at number 27 in the New Zealand charts, peaking at number 23 around the same time. On November 26, 2013, it was released as an official single in Australia. On the following week, it was the most added track to radio stations. Despite that, the highest position the single was able to peak was at number 62, when the song was set to be released as the second single. Nevertheless, the record was certified gold by the Australian Record Industry Association ARIA . Young Girls reached its highest mark at number 83 in the United Kingdom, after its official release. The track peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100 and stayed there for 14 weeks. In the Mainstream Top 40 the aforementioned song peaked inside the top 10, at number 9, something which the previous single was unable to do, thus ending the top 10 streak. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA . In Canada, the song peaked at number 19 and Music Canada MC awarded a gold certification to it, and made the 2013 year end list of the Canadian Hot 100. On December 12, 2012, it was reported for the first time that Young Girls would be the second single, a music video was already in production as of December 6, 2012 and was set to be directed by Cameron Duddy. Mars admitted to be spending a lot of his time thinking about the processing of the video, saying It's going to be something Ive never done before, I promise you that . A day before the performance on Victoria's Secret show an official audio video of the song was uploaded to YouTube. The official music video was never released. Young Girls made its debut during a performance on Saturday Night Live on October 2012. On December 4, 2012 Mars recorded performance on the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, aired on CBS. Sam Lansky of Idolator said the performance during the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was impressive , despite the singer not being runway friendly as RiRi . On December 7, 2012, Mars and his band sung the record on, the German show, Sat 1 Fruhstucksfernsehen and on December 31, 2012 at the New Year Alan Carr's Specstacular. It was performed occasionally on the Moonshine Jungle Tour 2013 2014 . The song was recorded by Mark Kozelek for his 2013 acoustic cover songs album Like Rats.

"Young Lord Stanley, possibly re issued as His Only Son, is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Jack Stanley who is disinherited by this father, Lord Stanley, for refusing to marry his cousin. Jack heads to America and takes a job as a groom. He is dismissed from his position after his employer learns of Jack's affections for his daughter, Ann. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley decides to reinstate Jack in his will and then promptly dies, giving him his entire fortune. Jack reads of his father's death in the newspaper and learns of his father's will. The film concludes with the lawyer bringing Jack to a dinner party as Lord Stanley . Ann's father wishes for her to earn his affections, but she is defiant and does not even look at him. Once she learns it his Jack, they kiss. The scenario was written by Lloyd Lonergan and the only known actor is Justus D. Barnes as Ann's father. A surviving print of the film exists in the Library of Congress and it shows the improvement of the Thanhouser interior sets over films from months prior. The film was released on October 25, 1910, and was met with mixed reviews. Jack Stanley is disinherited by his father, Lord Stanley, because he refuses to marry his cousin, Lady Maude. Jack emigrates to America, but has no money and has no job upon which to sustain himself. While pondering his actions, he witnesses a trio of riders approach and speak to him. He accepts a position as a groom for a wealthy American, but he falls in love with his daughter, Ann. When her father learns of this, he dismisses Jack and Ann says she will never marry anyone but him. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley has come to forgive his son and decided to reinstate him in his will. No sooner has the task been completed does Lord Stanley suddenly dies. Upon reading the paper, Jack sees an advertisement about the heir of the late Lord Stanley. He heads to Hotel Astor and learns that he has received his father's entire fortune. The lawyer accepts a dinner invitation at the wealthy American's house and brings along Jack. The father urges his daughter to win the affections of the rich, handsome and unmarried young Lord Stanley. Upon his arrival, the father who had shunned him is taken aback and greets him, but Ann refuses to even look at the guest. She ignores him, and refuses to face him even as they head towards the dining room, but Jack attempts to kiss her and she pulls away. Suddenly, Ann sees it is Jack and embraces him with a kiss. The script for the production was written by Lloyd Lonergan, an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The production of the film shows the continuing improvement of Thanhouser works, specifically for more realistic interior scenes, over those shot in the months prior. The progress referred to here is the improvement from works like The Two Roses. The interior sets are still very small, but the exterior shots show strength in their variety. Bowers believes that the uncommon surname, Snaith, is of some importance to Lonergan because of its reoccurring usage, including the titled works Miss Arabella Snaith and Professor Snaith. An analysis of the frame showing the newspaper advertisement shows that it was from a real newspaper dated from September 21, 1910. The title of the film might possibly be a reference to Lord Stanley , the courtesy title of the heir apparent of the Earl of Derby. At the time of the production Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley, was Lord Stanley . The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 25, 1910. The film was originally released a Young Lord Stanley, but the surviving print from the Library of Congress has His Only Son as what appears to be the title of the print. Bowers notes that this first card is in a different format from the other inter titles which follow and may have been a replacement or alternate name for the print. The surviving print is 928 feet long, and its shown length is 13 minutes and 35 seconds. The film likely had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Kansas, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Walton of The Moving Picture News said the film was, A bright, clean, human interest tale. It holds the attention from beginning to end. A thoroughly commendable reel in every way. The Moving Picture World offers a summary of the work and was more or less neutral in its review of the film. The reviewer states, It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot in a number of different directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, a travesty upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the common fault of actors by throwing things on the floor and how Ann's refusal to even look at the titled guest was overdone.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%20Lord%20Stanley

"The Young Victoria is a 2009 British American period drama film directed by Jean Marc Vallee and written by Julian Fellowes, based on the early life and reign of Queen Victoria, and her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha. Produced by Graham King, Martin Scorsese, Sarah Ferguson, and Timothy Headington, the film stars Emily Blunt, Rupert Friend, Paul Bettany, Miranda Richardson, Harriet Walter, Mark Strong, and Jim Broadbent among a large ensemble cast. As screenwriter, Fellowes sought to make the film as historically accurate as possible. With this in mind, Oscar winning costume designer Sandy Powell and historical consultant Alastair Bruce were hired, and filming for The Young Victoria took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, some aspects of the film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies. Momentum Pictures released the film in the United Kingdom and Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group opened The Young Victoria in limited theatrical release in the United States. Critical reception was generally positive. Princess Victoria of Kent is the heir presumptive to the British throne during the reign of her uncle King William IV and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her. On the one side is her mother, the Duchess of Kent, along with the comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a regency and giving him and her mother power. On the other side is her uncle, King Leopold I of Belgium, who wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between the United Kingdom and Belgium. He decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg Gotha seduce Victoria and he is coached in her likes and dislikes. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe Coburg Gotha, to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by their uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home. At a birthday reception in Windsor Castle, the King states his wish to be closer to Victoria and insults her mother. But when the King increases Victoria's income, this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary, and he appoints ladies in waiting for her from political families allied to him. King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the Privy Council, she announces that I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people . Victoria now moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace and her aunt, Queen Adelaide, advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert then comes to England to spend more time with Victoria. They bond more, dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor. Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves. When Lord Melbourne loses a vote in Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, wishes to replace some of her ladies in waiting with supporters of his own party and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself. Their honeymoon is short but loving, yet soon Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household. Soon after, when Victoria is fired upon by a would be assassin as they are riding in an open carriage, Albert throws himself across her and is wounded. This bravery leads to their reconciliation and Melbourne advises her to share with Albert also her work for the social welfare. The birth of their first child helps heal the breach between Victoria and her mother, who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis. The final title card sketches in their successful future until Albert's death at the age of 42. It was Sarah, Duchess of York, who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a great great great grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her with the help of an historian. The Victoria Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both fought for their love in the midst of public scrutiny. A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King, to whom she pitched the idea along with several others. At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed, King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years. The producer later remembered, she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three page synopsis of Victorias early life the precise span covered in The Young Victoria. just fell into place. King brought frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese on board as a co executive producer, as the Academy Award winning director knew pretty much all there is to know about British history . Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes contacted King to present ideas for a script, and according to the producer, seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks. Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying the horror of biopics, where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, he thought it would be better suited for a television series or for another film. For the film's director, King wanted someone who would steer us away from the traditional BBC type costume drama, and make a period film for an MTV audience . By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French Canadian filmmaker Jean Marc Vallee, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallee on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallee agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time. Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm going to do it my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I liked about her, this energy. was special and had this mystical quality. Academy Award winning costume designer Sandy Powell heard about the script and contacted King, who in turn hired her. Powell was granted exclusive access to Victoria's wedding dress and coronation robes while researching. Based upon his work on The Lives of Others and his German nationality, Hagen Bogdanski was selected as the director of photography. Fellowes enlisted his friend Alastair Bruce's help with the coronation ceremony's historical authenticity, which led to Bruce's employment as the film's historical consultant, his first film credit. Emily Blunt on her character Queen Victoria For the title role, King required the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress Emily Blunt read the script, and aware other actresses would fight for the part, she approached King early in the search process. Blunt later admitted she had a non existent knowledge of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, and she was in a job where she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting . They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon's Daughter. Blunt noted, I thought was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong willed, was very fascinating to me... In my life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all the time. And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress. After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle, where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself. Determined not to use any big Hollywood names, King looked at many European actors before settling on British actor Rupert Friend. They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride Prejudice. Vallee noted, I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right. He had a very good understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He really looks the part, he looks so romantic Co producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend our Scarlett O'Hara search . They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height 6 ft 1in also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty. The actor also thought their relationship was not a gooey love story rather, their arguments showed it wasn't an easy road by any means . Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano. He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of put in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other. Paul Bettany was cast as Lord Melbourne despite being roughly twenty years too young for the part. Vallee explained, We couldn't find a 58 year old actor who was sexy and good looking enough. Paul was a more than good enough actor to age from the inside, and he plays him as a great politician and a great seducer. Early in the casting process the crew wanted to cast Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, and believed she had such great chemistry with Blunt that it became genuinely uncomfortable watching them in a scene, as the scenes are so intense and real. Jim Broadbent and Mark Strong joined the cast as King William IV and Sir John Conroy, respectively, as did Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide. Sarah's elder daughter, Princess Beatrice of York, made her film debut in a small cameo role, becoming the first member of the Royal Family to appear in a non documentary film. Graham King on filming in England In consideration of the expense of a film shot in Britain, King initially sought to film in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, he came to the realisation that it was vital The Young Victoria be filmed in its native country for authenticity. Due to the Duchess of York's status and connections with the British royal family, The Young Victoria was able to film in many actual palaces and other landmarks. The film had a ten week shoot starting in August 2007. Scenes set at Westminster Abbey were filmed at Lincoln Cathedral in September and October, and Ham House was substituted for Kensington Palace. Blenheim Palace, Lancaster House and Ditchley Park doubled for internal scenes of the monarch's main residence, Buckingham Palace. Other scenes filmed at Hampton Court Palace, Arundel Castle in West Sussex, Wilton House near Salisbury, Balls Park and Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. Week four of shooting was especially intensive, as filming was done at a different site each day, including Osterley Park, Old Royal Naval College, Ham House, Novello Theatre and Hampton Court. Fellowes strove to make the script free of anachronisms, to the point where he became upset when actor Jim Broadbent ad libbed and told the Duke of Wellington to Enjoy the meal during a dinner scene, a phrase not proper for the time period. The writer commented, Everything I have put into it is based entirely on fact. It just happens to be a story that not many people are familiar with. Fellowes has remarked that while he would not alter the fundamental truth , such as the characters' real relationships to each other, he strove to use episodes to illustrate the journey you're taking your characters, and with them, your audience . Although largely faithful to a selection of historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events in order to increase dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot. Another departure from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Contrary to what is shown in the film, Albert was not present at the ceremony the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic. Furthermore, according to Fellowes, The scene where is trying to make her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor it's completely true , and The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two thirds of his speech is what he actually said However, the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech and, undepicted in the film, the princess burst into tears, and the two parties, soon realising that they had gone too far, patched up an uneasy truce . According to Charles Greville's memoirs The Queen looked in deep distress, the Princess burst into tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of Kent said not a word. Immediately after they rose and retired, and a terrible scene ensued the Duchess announced her immediate departure and ordered her carriage, but a sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day. William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was prime minister when Victoria came to the throne and a political mentor to the young queen, was forty years her senior, but is portrayed as a much younger man in the film. As for King Leopold, he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought her interest in Albert was due not to the latter's success in wooing her, but simply to please Leopold. Victoria's great great granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II viewed the film in a special screening according to one source, she believed the film had a lot of good points , but was unhappy with the change to the assassination attempt, and also thought the British officers' costumes looked too German. Apart from the assassination attempt, historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted that historically, the film's not at all bad , and especially praised the depiction of contemporary politics and the characteristics Friend put into his performance as Prince Albert. Director Vallee used his background as a DJ to create a structure for a film using music with the right rhythm and balance. I wanted to combine classical pieces with a rock spirit . During filming Vallee often played rock music, such as the Rolling Stones, to create the right mood before a scene. Executive producer Colin Vaines knew composer Ilan Eshkeri, and hired him for the film. Sinead O'Connor performed Only You , which O'Sullivan described as very much in line with one of the overriding aims of the film, which was to be hopeful and tell people that these amazing love stories really can happen, its not just a fairy tale. EMI Music released the film soundtrack. It received a nomination for the 2010 Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Score. The soundtrack includes the following tracks Momentum Pictures handled distribution of The Young Victoria in the United Kingdom.

Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman gave The Young Victoria a B he gave praise to Emily Blunt's performance and concluded, The Young Victoria has a subtler flow than you might expect, and at times it's calmer than you may like. Director Jean Marc Vallee's images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded princess fantasy it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a frivolously entertaining film and believed it was directed with some snap by Jean Marc Vallee . Dargis finished her review, Despite the filmmakers efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the films pleasures are as light as its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victorias bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours. The Daily Telegraph called The Young Victoria a production of the highest calibre with an impeccable cast. The Times' Wendy Ide gave the film 3 out 5 stars wrote It's decorative, but suffers from a stultifying lack of drama and found similarities to the 1998 film Elizabeth. Ide found Victoria and Albert's relationship to be persuasive and rather charming, and praised the performances of both the main and supporting cast, particularly noting Bettany's scene stealing performance. Less positive was Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, who gave the film two out of five stars. While initially looking forward to Blunt's performance, he believed the black belt minx actress was never really allowed to let rip. All that coiled feline sensuality stay coiled . He thought the queen's relationship with Prince Albert very, very unsexy , as their devotion makes for a boring film . Bradshaw did praise the power dynamics around Victoria, but concluded I spent an hour and three quarters waiting for this film to start. Where was the tang and the zing and the oomph of Fellowes's cracking script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park Emily Blunt received various nominations for her role.

He tossed a no hitter in 1997 while compiling a 60 record, helping Highland Park reach the Class 4A Texas state baseball final. During his senior year, he was District Most Valuable Player in basketball, and led his baseball team to the state championship, while pitching in two no hitters. That year, he was a first team All State selection in basketball and baseball. After a high school career as an athlete and scholar, Young excelled in both baseball and basketball for Princeton University and became the Ivy League's first male two sport Rookie of the Year. Selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the June 2000 draft, he had brief professional experiences in the Pirates, Montreal Expos, and Texas Rangers minor league systems before debuting with the Rangers in August 2004. Young's professional baseball career took off in the 2006 season, when he was the major league leader in opponent batting average, hits per nine innings and road earned run average ERA and was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June. Additionally, he extended his streak of consecutive undefeated games started as a visiting pitcher to 24, and secured the only Padres win in the team's 31 series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Division Series. In 2007, he defended his opponent batting average and hits per nine innings titles, but instead of winning the road ERA title he won the home ERA title. He is 6 feet 10 inches 2.08 m , which makes him, along with former pitchers Eric Hillman, Randy Johnson, Andrew Brackman and Andrew Sisco, the second tallest player in baseball history, next to relief pitcher Jon Rauch who is 6 feet 11 inches 2.11 m and Young's teammate on the 2012 New York Mets . He was elected to the 2007 MLB All Star Game as a first time All Star via the All Star Final Vote. Young attended Highland Park High School, where he played basketball and baseball.

In basketball, he averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots a game, and in baseball he had an 83 record with a 1.70 ERA and 95 strikeouts in 80 innings pitched. As a sophomore in the fall of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity basketball team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed a large part of the season after getting off to a 60 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series. By January of Young's senior season, he had led his basketball team to a district leading 231 40 in district record and first place in both The Dallas Morning News' Class 4A area poll and the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches' state poll.

He was later chosen to play in the mid summer Texas High School Coaches Association's Southwestern All Star basketball game at the Hofheinz Pavilion. Young announced he planned to attend Princeton in May 1998. He chose Princeton over Boston College, University of Oklahoma, University of Pennsylvania, University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and Yale University. Young's decision was based on Princeton's rising national profile in basketball and the opportunity to work with baseball coach Scott Bradley, who had played catcher for the Seattle Mariners while 610 pitcher Randy Johnson was with the team. On May 9, 1998, Young was involved in a combined no hitter when he pitched into the fifth inning against Moises E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews. Highland Park won this game, which was the clinching Region II best of 3 bi district series game, by the 10 run rule. Young displayed home run power as a senior, and in some games, he played designated hitter.

Young was the starting pitcher at UFCU Disch Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship game victory against Calallen High School, and he clinched the game with a successful pickoff move.

His athletic career was not entirely on hold as an upperclassman, and he was able to get some low minor league experience before completing his degree at Princeton in politics in June 2002 and becoming a full time professional athlete.

His fifth start was a six inning performance in a 10 win against the Anaheim Angels on September 19. This was the first Ranger 10 victory since August 25, 2000 against the Toronto Blue Jays, a stretch of 669 games. The club went 52 during his starts in his brief 2004 stint with the club. Young was one of three rookies on the Opening Day roster. He made 31 starts in 2005 with the Rangers, compiling a 127 record with a 4.26 ERA. His twelve victories tied Kevin Brown's record for most wins by a Rangers rookie. His season started slowly, with seven earned runs allowed in 713 innings pitched 8.59 ERA over his first two starts. However, over the course of 11 starts from April 17 June 13, he lowered his ERA to a season low 2.78 by going 62, 2.18 in 7013 innings pitched over that stretch. This included the month of May when he went 30 in five starts with a 1.42 ERA that was third best among all qualifying major leaguers for the month.

Young recorded a personal best eight strikeouts in a seven inning no decision on June 2 at Detroit. The closest Young came to a no hitter was 523 innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the beneficiary of the second highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 50 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 77 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 81 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 78 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night. In his rookie season, Young ranked in the top five among qualifying major league rookies in several statistical categories strikeouts second, 137 , wins tied for third, 12 , ERA fourth, 4.26 , starts fifth, 31 and innings pitched fifth, 16423 . He also tied Rangers rookie club records wins 12, Edwin Correa in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989 and pre All Star break wins 8, Jeff Zimmerman in 1999 and Jose Guzman in 1986 . Young ranked fifth among all American League pitchers with 7.5 strikeouts per 9 innings. Despite this success, however, he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent Terrmel Sledge and Adrian Gonzalez to the San Diego Padres for starting pitcher Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor league catcher Billy Killian. 2006 marked Young's breakout season. His ERA continued its downward trend, falling to 3.46 over 31 starts, good enough for sixth best in the National League, and he recorded a career high 169 strikeouts. He finished with an 115 record, led all major league pitchers with a 2.41 road ERA, allowed a league leading 6.72 hits per 9 innings pitched, and a .206 opponent batting average. He had 15 no decisions, the most among MLB starting pitchers in 2006. During 2006 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41. During the season, Young won a National League Pitcher of the Month award, took a no hitter into the sixth inning or beyond three times, and extended his undefeated road start streak to 24 games. This streak made Young one of only three pitchers in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without a loss Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons, with Russ Meyer falling one short, going undefeated in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons. In his first six starts after Memorial Day, he improved from a 33 with a 4.32 ERA to 73 with a 2.97 ERA, by allowing only four earned runs over 3823 innings. He was named one of five candidates from the National League for Major League Baseball's All Star Final Vote to determine the final official selection for the 2006 Major League Baseball All Star Game however, Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra was elected. Nonetheless, his strong June performance during which he allowed 16 hits and 13 walks over 3023 innings, maintained a 1.17 ERA and struck out 34 earned him the National League Pitcher of the Month award. His five starts in June were highlighted by a career best 12 strikeout performance on June 9 against the Florida Marlins and a June 21 win over his former team, the Texas Rangers. On September 22, Young had a no hitter through 813 innings of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two run home run. This would have been the first no hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 523 innings. Young also took a no hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he surrendered a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 513 innings, making him one of only two pitchers Steve Trachsel June 2025, 2002 to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season. He ended the season by winning his first career postseason start on October 7, he earned a 31 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He pitched 623 shutout innings, struck out nine, walked two and allowed four hits. It remains the Padres' only victory in ten post season games against the Cardinals. The Padres lost the series three games to one. Young's 60 road performance in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post season play began in 1903. However, it was the first to be followed by a postseason road victory. In November, he traveled to Japan to take part in the Major League Baseball Japan All Star Series. Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the Yomiuri Giants, which was memorable for the major leaguers' three run ninth inning rally to earn a tie. This game was the prelude to the five game series which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games in Osaka and Fukuoka. Young pitched the fourth game of the series. Young also blogged on behalf of mlb.com about daily life during the trip. He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer, time in the Harajuku, and travels on the Bullet Train. In his season debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants, Young became the 435th different pitcher to surrender a home run to Barry Bonds when he surrendered Bonds' first of the season and 735th of his career. The game marked Young's 25th consecutive road start without a loss. Young was 90 during the streak, which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 at Dodger Stadium in a 93 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without a loss was Greg Maddux who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 1998. Young's streak began on June 25, 2005. On April 10, Young signed a four year extension with the Padres through the 2010 season, reportedly worth US 14.5 million with a club option for 2011. On June 16, Young threw a pitch that hit Chicago Cubs All Star first baseman Derrek Lee on the back of the upper left arm. The day before the fracas, Alfonso Soriano homered off David Wells, and the Padres believed Soriano showed poor sportsmanship by admiring and celebrating his home run. The pitch nicked Lee's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist. When the 6 ft 5 in 1.96 m Lee began walking towards first base, both he and Young, 6 ft 10 in 2.08 m , exchanged words, and a bench clearing altercation ensued. Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game, along with Jake Peavy and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry. On June 18, Young and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl, and Perry was suspended three games. All suspended parties were fined, as were Peavy and Brian Giles. Young and Lee appealed their suspensions, which were to begin the following day. At the time of the scuffle in the fourth inning, both pitchers were working on no hitters. Young was ejected in the game, and he earned a no decision in the game which the Padres ultimately won 10. On June 24, Jake Peavy surrendered three earned runs in five innings, which caused his ERA to rise from 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings to take the lead with a 2.04 ERA. On July 1, Young was nominated as a candidate for the All Star Final Vote, contending against Tom Gorzelanny, Roy Oswalt, Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano. In a bid for the final spot on July 4, Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 10 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead, but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by a slim margin 1.9968 to 1.9970 . The voting ended on July 5, with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All Star Game selection. The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All Star team joining Lou Gehrig, Red Rolfe, Ron Darling, Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger . Young entered the All Star break with the major league lead in ERA and opponent batting average as well as an undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All Star break and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All Star Game at AT T Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 54 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside the park home run in All Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki. He was placed on the disabled list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12 start five decision undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 50 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed with 44 . He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start. Young started the season in the second spot in the Padres rotation between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation is the only one that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 1215, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all time list. Then, on September 7 he came within four outs of perfection when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one out home run in the eighth inning. He allowed two hits, did not walk a batter and struck out five, en route to 101 victory at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or first no hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter. After starting the season with a 42 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15 day disabled list on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60 day disabled list. In August, he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation. For the 2009 season, he was 4 6 with a 5.21 ERA. Young pitched six shutout innings in the second game of the season before being pulled with a right shoulder strain. He missed almost the entire season except for three starts near the end of the season, finishing the season 20 with a 0.90 ERA. In November, the Padres declined to pick up the option for 2011. In 2010, he was chosen as the eighth smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News. On January 17, 2011, Young signed a contract with the New York Mets worth 1.1 million with the ability to reach up to 4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 71 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he was a free agent. On March 26, 2012, Young signed on a minor league deal with the Mets. He had recently undergone surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder. He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons' disabled list before being activated on May 10. Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27. He compiled a 10 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts. On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers. The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5. On June 5, 2012, Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets, giving up 3 runs 2 earned over 5 innings in a game that was eventually decided in 12 innings. On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a paternity leave, which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start. The move was for the purpose of freeing up a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three day leave. Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year. On February 21, 2013, Young signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and an invitation to training camp. On March 26, 2013 he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after opting out of his contract. He was re signed by the Nationals on April 4, 2013. He was then assigned to Triple A Syracuse. He made his season debut on April 23 against Rochester, giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings. He made 6 additional starts before going on the disabled list with a neck injury on May 28, 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the first inning. He made 2 starts at the end of the year in the Gulf Coast League and with Short Season Auburn before the end of the injury marred season. In 9 total starts, he went 12 with a 6.81 ERA, striking out 21 in 37 innings. After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck, he had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. This condition is a nerve problem that puts pressure on a pitcher's shoulder. On November 19, 2013, Young re signed with the Nationals on a minor league deal. He was released on March 25, 2014. Young signed a highly incentivized one year deal with the Seattle Mariners on March 27, 2014. Young was scheduled to debut as a starter for the Mariners on April 4. However, the Oakland Coliseum had its first rainout since 1998. As a result, after 159 Major League starts and 102 Minor League starts, Young made his first appearance as a relief pitcher other than the 2007 All Star Game and he pitched two shutout innings on April 6 against the Oakland A's later in that series. He made his first Major League start since September 9, 2012 on April 13 against Oakland. He posted six scoreless innings, while scattering 4 hits and 3 walks. By early June, Young was in the conversation for Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, with a 52 start and 3.27 ERA, according to MLB.com's Adam Lewis. In helping to stabilize a rotation battered by injuries and ineffectual fifth starters, Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was unabashed in his praise of the right hander at the time, calling him a godsend. Young finished the season with a 129 record and a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts. His 7.8 hits per nine innings was the sixth in the AL. Following the season, Young was recognized with the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, The Sporting News American League Comeback Player of the Year Award, and Players Choice Comeback Player of the Year Award. At the conclusion of the season, Young became a free agent. On March 7, 2015, Young signed with the Kansas City Royals. Young entered the season in the long reliever role with the Royals. He appeared in the Royals' sixth game on April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels with two scoreless innings as the Royals started the season 60. Young made his first start with the Royals on May 1. He tossed five no hit innings against the Detroit Tigers. On June 16, Young posted 7 shutout innings and 3 runs batted in against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first Royals pitcher to tally 3 RBI in a game since 1972. After achieving a record of 86 with a 3.25 ERA through the end of July, Young was returned to the bullpen on July 31 after posting a 5.11 ERA over a 5 game stretch. On September 27 one day after his father died , Young made his first start since July 28 and pitched 5 no hit innings against the Cleveland Indians. On October 20, Young started and pitched 4 2 3 innings in a game 4 victory in the 2015 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. It was Young's first postseason start since the 2006 National League Division Series. He earned the win in the October 27 game 1 of the 2015 World Series when he shut down the New York Mets, giving up a walk and no hits while striking out 4 over the final three innings, to help the Royals win 54 in 14 innings. On December 7, 2015, the Royals announced that they had signed Young to a two year 11.75 million contract with mutual third year option. After beginning the 2016 season with a record of 1 5 in 7 starts, Young was placed on the disabled list with a strained right forearm from May 12 to 28. After his DL stint, Young continued to serve the Royals as a swingman out of the bullpen, finishing the season appearing in 34 games, 13 starts. He was 3 9 and registered a 6.19 ERA, his highest ERA over a full season to that point in his career. He also tied a career high by allowing 28 home runs, and gave up a career high 10.6 hits per 9 innings. Young began the season in the bullpen after failing to win a spot in the Kansas City rotation. On June 23, 2017, Young was designated for assignment by the Royals. He was immediately released. For the 2017 season, he was 0 0 with a 7.50 ERA in 14 games. Young signed a minor league contract with the Padres on December 29, 2017. He was released on March 27, 2018. Young moved into administration effective May 14, 2018 as the Vice President, On Field Operations, Initiatives Strategy under MLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre, reporting directly to Senior Vice President, On Field Operations Peter Woodfork. Young is not a traditional power pitcher. He is said to be a control pitcher in a 6 feet 10 inches 2.08 m power pitcher's bodyhis pitching style is more like Greg Maddux's than that of five time Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson, who is the same height as Young. Young has been traded three times partly because of the low velocity of his fastball, which is in the 8387 miles per hour 133.6140 km h range. Young has learned how to use precise location to make his fastball effective. He has also been compared to another control pitcher, Jim Palmer, because Young similarly induces popups and fly ball outs with deceptive late movement on his high fastballs. Over 50 of the balls put in play against him are fly balls. Of the flyballs hit off Young in 2007, 3.8 were home runs. while the average is about 11 . From 2003 to 2006 the best single season percentage was 6.2 by Dontrelle Willis in 2005. Young's mid 2000s repertoire included fastballs, curveballs, sliders and changeups. His curveball is a slow curveball and his 85 miles per hour 137 km h fastball has been described by former teammate and catcher Mike Piazza as having late life and late movement that seems to jump. His curveball is used to keep the hitters off balance so that they do not jump on his low velocity fastball. Former Ranger pitching coach Orel Hershiser says Young has the ability to throw his fastball to all locations effectively which gives him a chance at success. Hershiser describes Young's pitches as sneaky fast because his methodical delivery and size give him deception. This delivery has also left him susceptible to stolen bases due to the relatively long time it takes for him to deliver a pitch from the stretch. By 2012, nearly all of his pitches were fastballs or sliders. As of the end of the 2015 season, Young has a career .150 batting average, including 31 hits, eight of which were extra base hits six doubles, one triple, and one home run . He has yet to record a stolen base. The only Princeton players who have hit a home run or recorded a stolen base at least once during their careers, along with Young, are Moe Berg, Dutch Sterrett, Homer Hillebrand, Dutch Meier, Ted Reed, Bobby Vaughn, and Will Venable. Venable is the most recent player to have accomplished the feat. These same players join Young as Princeton alumni to have hit a home run. Berg had been the last to do so before Young hit his home run on September 20, 2008. Young's wife, Elizabeth Patrick, is the granddaughter of Lester Patrick, who was the namesake of the National Hockey League's Patrick Division and the Lester Patrick Trophy. She was also a member of the Princeton University class of 2002, and she attends law school in Washington, D.C. On March 4, 2008, she was induced into labor four days before her due date to deliver a girl named Catherine Elizabeth. In July 2010, the Youngs had their second child first son , Scott Patrick. On June 6, 2012, the Youngs had their third child, Grant Christopher.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris%20Young%20%28pitcher%29
"As manager MLB records Denton True Cy Young March 29, 1867 November 4, 1955 was an American Major League Baseball MLB pitcher. Born in Gilmore, Ohio, he worked on his family's farm as a youth before starting his professional baseball career. Young entered the major leagues in 1890 with the National League's Cleveland Spiders and pitched for them until 1898. He was then transferred to the St. Louis Cardinals franchise. In 1901, Young jumped to the American League and played for the Boston Red Sox franchise until 1908, helping them win the 1903 World Series. He finished his career with the Cleveland Naps and Boston Rustlers, retiring in 1911. Young was one of the hardest throwing pitchers in the game early in his career. After his speed diminished, he relied more on his control and remained effective into his forties. By the time Young retired, he had established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. He holds MLB records for the most career wins, with 511, along with most career innings pitched, games started, and complete games. He led his league in wins during five seasons and pitched three no hitters, including a perfect game. Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1956, one year after his death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in each league for each season. Cy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young, Jr. a German American and Nancy Mottmiller. He was christened Denton True Young. The couple had four more children Jesse Carlton, Alonzo, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie's father gave him the 54 acres 220,000 m2 of farm land he owned. Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years. Young was also known as Farmer Young and Farmboy Young . Young stopped his formal education after he completed the sixth grade so he could help out on the family's farm. In 1885, Young moved with his father to Nebraska, and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore. Young played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a semi professional Carrollton team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league Canton team, which started Young's professional career. Young began his professional career in 1889 with the Canton, Ohio, team of the Tri State League, a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball. Cy Young's nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a cyclone had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to Cy , which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life. During Young's one year with the Canton team, he won 15 games and lost 15. Franchises in the National League, the major professional baseball league at the time, wanted the best players available to them. Therefore, in 1890, Young signed with the Cleveland Spiders, a team which had moved from the American Association to the National League the previous year. On August 6, 1890, Young's major league debut, he pitched a three hit 81 victory over the Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a baseball statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history. Early on, Young established himself as one of the harder throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On the last day of the season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders manager Gus Schmelz, He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you 1,000 27,885 today for him. Schmelz replied, Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube. Two years after Young's debut, the National League moved the pitcher's position back by 5 feet 1.5 m . Since 1881, pitchers had pitched within a box whose front line was 50 feet 15 m from home base, and since 1887 they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball. The back line was 55 feet 6 inches 16.92 m away from home. In 1893, 5 feet 1.5 m was added to the back line, yielding the modern pitching distance of 60 feet 6 inches 18.44 m . In the book The Neyer James Guide to Pitchers, sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young, Amos Rusie, and Jouett Meekin threw was the impetus that caused the move. The 1892 regular season was a success for Young, who led the National League in wins 36 , ERA 1.93 , and shutouts 9 . Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first half title, and the Spiders won the second half title, with a best of nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 00 tie. The Spiders faced the Baltimore Orioles in the Temple Cup, a precursor to the World Series, in 1895. Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup, four games to one. It was around this time that Young added what he called a slow ball to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm. The pitch today is called a changeup. In 1896, Young lost a no hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one hitter. Prior to the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs simultaneously. The Browns were renamed the Perfectos , and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers Young, Jesse Burkett, and Bobby Wallace. The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. Meanwhile, the depleted Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. Young spent two years with St. Louis, which is where he found his favorite catcher, Lou Criger. The two men were teammates for a decade. In 1901, the rival American League declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's Boston Americans for a 3,500 contract 105,406 today . Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In his first year in the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA , thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42 of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins. In February 1902, before the start of the baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University. The sixth grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905. The Boston Americans played the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first modern World Series in 1903. Young, who started Game One against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young performed better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in three runs in Game Five. Young finished the series with a 21 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games. After one hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, How do you like that, you hayseed Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules the front edge of the pitcher's box was only 45 feet 14 m from home base the modern release point is about 10 feet 3.0 m farther away walks required eight balls and pitchers were obliged to throw side armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20 inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in. In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13 inning tie. In 1908, Young pitched the third no hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43 year old Nolan Ryan surpassed the feat. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At this time, Young was the second oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters. On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated Cy Young Day. No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All Stars from the league's other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox. When the season ended, he posted a 1.26 ERA, which gave him not only the lowest in his career, but also gave him a major league record of being the oldest pitcher with 150 innings pitched to post a season ERA under 1.50. Young was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the Cleveland Naps of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington. He split 1911, his final year, between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers. On September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 10, for his last career victory. In his final start two weeks later, the last eight batters of Young's career combined to hit a triple, four singles, and three doubles. By the time of his retirement, Young's control had faltered. He had also gained weight. In two of his last three years, he was the oldest player in the league. Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. Young compiled 511 wins, which is the most in major league history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson, second on the list. At the time of Young's retirement, Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364. In addition to wins, Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched 7,356 , most career games started 815 , and most complete games 749 . He also retired with 316 losses, the most in MLB history. Young's career record for strikeouts was broken by Johnson in 1921. Young's 76 career shutouts are fourth all time. Ogden Nash, Sport magazine January 1949 Young led his league in wins five times 1892, 1895, and 19011903 , finishing second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He won at least thirty games in a season five times. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two more than the runners up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 1.93 and in 1901 1.62 , and was three times the runner up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but this was not uncommon during the dead ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901 , and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings fourteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22 year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise. In addition, Young pitched three no hitters, including the third perfect game in baseball history, first in baseball's modern era . Particularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control. In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his league's top ten for innings pitched in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it , said Young, and there wasn't any use wasting them. Young once described his approach before a game I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day. Beginning in 1912, Young lived and worked on his farm. In 1913, he served as manager of the Cleveland Green Sox of the Federal League, which was at the time an outlaw league. However, he never worked in baseball after that. Young's wife, Roba, whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933. After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement. In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall. By 1940, Young's only source of income was stock dividends of 300 per year 5,365 today . On November 4, 1955, Young died on the Benedums' farm at the age of 88. He was buried in Peoli, Ohio. Young's career is seen as a bridge from baseball's earliest days to its modern era he pitched against stars such as Cap Anson, already an established player when the National League was first formed in 1876, as well as against Eddie Collins, who played until 1930. When Young's career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of 60 feet 6 inches 18.44 m until Young's fourth season he did not wear a glove until his sixth season. Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1956, about one year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in Major League Baseball for each season. The first award was given to Brooklyn's Don Newcombe. Originally, it was a single award covering the whole of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for the National League and one for the American League. On September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by Northeastern University on the site of the Red Sox's original stadium, the Huntington Avenue Grounds. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball. A home plate shaped plaque next to the statue reads On October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims later known as the Red Sox and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three. In 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at The Sporting News ranked Young 14th on their list of Baseball's 100 Greatest Players . That same year, baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All Century Team. Italics denotes post season perfect game",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy%20Young

While being a classy centre half , he is an aggressive player who likes to win the ball and his play has been described as shackling .

"Hoylande Denune Young Failey June 26, 1903 January 12, 1986 was an American chemist. During World War II she worked at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory. After the war she became the first woman to be appointed as a division head at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the first woman to chair the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society. Hoylande Denune Young was born in Columbus, Ohio, on June 26, 1903. She had a sister, Hilda. She became interested in chemistry when she was in high school, where there were separate boys' and girls' chemistry classes. Due to course scheduling conflicts she was permitted to take the more challenging boys' course, although she had to sit up the back of the class. She entered Ohio State University, from which she received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1924. She then went on to earn a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, writing her thesis on Stereoisomeric Bromoimino Ketones under the supervision of Julius Stieglitz. After graduating, Young became an industrial research chemist, working in the lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became an assistant professor of chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published. With the United States at war, Young took a job in 1942 as a scientific librarian with the Office of Scientific Research and Development OSRD at the University of Chicago's Toxicity Laboratory, compiling American, British and Canadian reports on chemical warfare, and preparing an index of toxic chemicals. In 1945, she transferred to the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory as a chemist. There she edited papers that would later be published by the Atomic Energy Commission as part of its National Nuclear Energy Series. She later served on the editorial board of the National Nuclear Energy Series, representing the Argonne National Laboratory. In 1946, Young joined the newly created Argonne National Laboratory in 1946 as Director of Technical Information, the first woman to be appointed a division head. She would remain at Argonne until she retired in 1964. In 1956, she became the first woman to be appointed chair of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society. She was involved in setting up its Distinguished Service Award, and later received it herself in 1975. She was also a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago. She was a charter member of the American Nuclear Society and the president of Iota Sigma Pi, a national honor society for women in chemistry. In 1959, the Chicago Tribune named her as one of the city's most distinguished women in business or the professions, and the Argonne National Laboratory established the Hoylande D. Young lecture series in her honor in 1963. Young married Crawford Failey, whom she had known in the Toxicity Laboratory. She died at her home in Hyde Park, Chicago, on January 12, 1986, and was buried in the Riverside Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoylande%20Young
"Madeleine Maddy Young is a fictional character in the BBC medical drama Holby City, portrayed by actress Nadine Lewington. The character first appeared on screen on 16 January 2007 in episode Face Value series 9, episode 15 of the programme. Her final appearance in the show was in the Series 11 episode Just A Perfect Day when her character was fatally stabbed. Her role in the show was that of a Senior House Officer undergoing her general surgical rotation in Holby's acute admissions unit. Described by the BBC as enthusiastic ... fun and dedicated to her job , Maddy was created alongside fellow new character General Surgical Consultant Dan Clifford. Her major storylines have centred on their friendship and relationship as well as her troubled family background and her continual rule breaking. The character has proven popular with viewers, seeing Lewington long listed for the 'Most Popular Newcomer' award at the 2007 National Television Awards for her portrayal of the character, and Maddy voted by Holby City fans 'Favourite Newcomer' of Series 9. However, in October 2007, the character also came under heavy criticism from drinks industry body the Portman Group, resulting from an incident of on screen binge drinking broadcast without showing any negative effects, which the group lambasted as highly irresponsible. In May 2009, Maddy died after being stabbed by disturbed patient Chantelle Tanner. After the attack, a full episode misled viewers by showing what would have happened if Maddy had been saved, before revealing at the end that Maddy had actually died. Maddy was created by Holby City's executive producer Tony McHale as an SHO level doctor who would work on the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit. The character was conceived alongside fellow series 9 newcomer Dan Clifford Peter Wingfield , who arrived as the new General Surgical Consultant of the hospital's Keller Ward, in episode It's Been a Long Day eight weeks before the introduction of Maddy. BBC Publicity explained at the time Maddy is good friends with Clifford Peter Wingfield and has saved him from trouble on a few occasions . In the closing credits of the character's first two appearances episodes Face Value and Feast or Famine her name was given as Maddie Young . In every subsequent episode, the character has been credited by the altered spelling of Maddy Young . On 4 October 2006, it was announced that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City's sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching . On joining the cast of Holby City, Lewington commented I've been on cloud nine since receiving that all important phone call. My parents are surprised to suddenly have a doctor in the family but are thrilled nonetheless I'm just really looking forward to being part of an incredible cast in such a successful show I can't wait A spokesperson for BBC Publicity added We are delighted to have Nadine on board to play the part of Maddy, she's a great addition to the show and her character will be involved in some dramatic storylines. Discussing her casting a year into her time on the show, Lewington assessed I enjoy it more as I wade through the years. As with any ensemble work, the more time spent as a team, working together and discovering each others rhythms, dynamics and struggles, the better. And because of that, more fun. I certainly feel more settled and confident. Part of something. It was all a bit daunting for a while. Upon announcing the character's creation, BBC Publicity initially stated of her personality Maddy's enthusiasm and ability speaks for itself. She's a young SHO who loves her job and is fun to be around. Expanding, it was added that Maddy's young, fun and up for a laugh while, at the same time, dedicated to her job. She's definitely not going to be single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which could just get in the way... The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy . Comparing the character's personality to her own, Lewington commented My good pal, Sir Robert Powell Mark Williams has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things She's says things I wouldn't. But when she cries, I cry and when she smiles, I smile . Throughout the show's ninth series, Maddy maintained a close relationship with General Surgical Consultant Dan Clifford. It was revealed in her first episode that she had previously worked alongside him in Middlesex. It later came to light that she once covered for him when he attempted an operation drunk going so far as to date the lesbian anesthetist present during the surgery in order to buy her silence. Shortly before his departure from Holby City, Dan and Maddy briefly became romantically involved. However, Dan was also in love with his sister in law Louise and ultimately departed for a new job in France, leaving Maddy behind. Peter Wingfield Dan has said of the relationship Lewington's own assessment of the relationship is that Maddy doesn't have anyone in her life that she can count on. Dan was her family and that's what hurt so bad. I guess to have Dan as a lover would mean that he would never go away. She wouldn't have to share him. Dan loved Maddy sincerely which is why he didn't want to risk hurting her anymore than he already had. He was too messed up to be good for anyone and he knew it. The character also had a brief sexual relationship with hospital Lothario Sam Strachan. She and Sam had a one night stand in episode The Borders of Sleep , and went on to become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen Duncan Pow . Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry go round at Holby just yet . He added that Any man would be a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back . Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is waiting for a new hunk Maddy arrives at Holby City Hospital in episode Face Value . It is revealed that she has a history with General Surgical Consultant Dan Clifford, and that the pair are good friends. The pre existing relationship between Maddy and Dan initially makes some staff wary of her, especially on the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, where she is assigned. However, she quickly strikes up a friendship with PRHOs Matt Parker and Dean West, and Senior Staff Nurse Donna Jackson. Maddy engages in a one night stand with Cardiothoracic Surgical Registrar Sam Strachan in episode The Borders of Sleep , and later bends the rules to help him take care of underage prostitute patient Jade MacGuire. In episode What Lies Beneath , Maddy's father arrives in Holby having escaped from prison. She treats him for an injury he sustained prior to escaping, and, aided by Dan, helps him avoid the police when they arrive searching for him. Her father reveals to Dan that Maddy once stole pharmacy drugs and planted them on the abusive boyfriend of her twin sister, Hannah. She discusses her past with Dan, mentioning the fact she once covered for him when he operated drunk. Maddy gets into further trouble when she poses as Cardiothoracic Consultant Elliot Hope, attending a racial awareness course under the guise of Ellie , only to be caught out by the hospital's Chief Executive Officer Jayne Grayson. Maddy's sister Hannah arrives at Holby with an abscess in episode Guilt by Association . Maddy convinces her to have an operation by illegally stopping her pain medication, in order to emphasize how badly she needs surgery. In the following episode, Hannah seeks out Maddy's help when she accidentally gives her daughter, Sunny, a methadone overdose. Although Maddy again breaks the rules and the law to help them, Sunny dies while being treated from an exacerbated pre existing cardiac problem. The police are suspicious of Sunny's death, but Dan blackmails fellow Consultant Ric Griffin into covering up for Maddy. Dan and Maddy go on to share a short lived romantic relationship before his departure in October 2007. She is hurt by Dan's love for his sister in law Louise, and left heartbroken when Dan departs Holby for a prestigious job in France. In episode Love Will Tear Us Apart , Maddy makes an error in the middle of an operation after Dan calls her out of the blue to arrange a meeting. She is devastated when he later stands her up. Following Dan's departure, Maddy goes on to support Sam through his battle with Non Hodgkin lymphoma, and form a professional relationship with the new head of the AAU, Linden Cullen. When Linden is suspended following the death of a patient, Maddy breaks the law by stealing samples from the hospital's morgue to prove his innocence. She is severely reprimanded by Jayne Grayson, although Linden is eventually cleared. When Linden becomes involved with a case of conjoined twins, Maddy is temporarily placed in charge of the AAU in his absence. Maddy had recently been transferred to Keller on surgical rotation. She continuely tried to impress Ric. But Ric kept taking his frustrations out on her because she was friends with Tom O' Dowd. But Ric was impressed in the end and offered her a promotion and told she could be a great surgeon one day. In Mirror, Mirror Maddy's sister Hannah, having been released from prison, arrives at Holby with her cellmate Chantelle, who has been stabbed, in her car. Because Chantelle refuses treatment in the hospital, believing they will send her back to jail for being in a fight, Maddy agrees to treat Chantelle in secret. Linden finds out and tries to help and they operate on her but Ric finds out and tells her to report it to the police. She refuses as doing so would cause Chantelle to run away, leaving her with a potentially fatal stab wound. As a consequence Ric withdraws her from the promotion interview. In Seeing Other People Chantelle stabs Maddy in the back, whilst she was on her way to Ric Griffin to talk about the promotion. In Just a Perfect Day Maria finds Maddy stabbed and bleeding out on the floor in the Keller ward toilets. She immediately starts trying to resuscitate her. Linden rushes in to help. Three weeks have passed since Maddy was stabbed. She is in Holby Care and we hear her thinking about a letter she has written to her sister Hannah. She seems to be fully recovered and is desperately trying to get back to work and be interviewed for the ST3 job. Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and take things easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants to get back to work. Meanwhile, Maddy receives a visit from Dan Clifford, who she has not seen for over 18 months since he took his job abroad. After hearing about Maddy's attack he has arrived to see how she is doing and to offer her a research position with him at his new hospital. Maddy decides to try for the position at Holby before making any decisions. Back on the ward, a father and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor injuries but the police seem to believe he had something to do with the incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is. Ric is having second thoughts about allowing Maddy to be interviewed. He explains to Michael that he doesn't think that she is ready for the position. Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy is perfect. Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks he might have made a mistake and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated. Clifford comforts Maddy and explains that the board have now asked him to move back to Holby and there is a position waiting for him. After advice from Linden Maddy decides to stay at Holby. Her aim is to show Ric what she is capable of achieving. Determined to show Ric her skill she takes a leading role in the procedure on the stab victim. Ric is impressed but explains that he would like to see more before she gets an interview. Her plan has failed. Maddy overhears Ric and Clifford talking about her. Clifford explains that Ric might be hit with a lawsuit if he denies Maddy an interview and suggests that he interviews her without giving her the job. The stab victim dies and Maddy blames herself, even though there was nothing she could have done. But Ric tells Maddy he has reconsidered and she can have an interview. Although she's happy to have this opportunity she knows that Ric is only doing it to avoid a court case. She heads into the interview, bold and honest about her work. She impresses the board and they give her the position. She can't believe it. She heads out to tell Dan Clifford the news, who then tells her that the board have offered that he can move his entire work to Holby and he tell her that the reason he wants to stay is that he loves her. Maddy is overjoyed and they kiss passionately against the bonnet of his car. She heads back to the ward to find the father of the stab victim missing. She finds him in the basement, confused and he speaks to Maddy as if she is his dead daughter. Maddy tries to help but he keeps referring to Maddy as his daughter. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that everything that happened since Maddy was stabbed was actually a dream and that Maddy actually died in Chantelle's attack. This whole episode was Maddy living out her perfect day in her head. On October 21, 2009, Chantelle was admitted to AAU, pregnant after her boyfriend kicked her in the stomach. Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy. Within six months of arriving at Holby City, Lewington was long listed for the 'Most Popular Newcomer' award at the 2007 National Television Awards, for her portrayal of the character. In the 2007 official fan awards, Maddy was voted fans' 'Favourite Newcomer of series 9', as well as third 'Favourite Female of series 9', fourth 'Favourite All Time Female' and fifth 'Favourite series 9 Storyline', for the plot strand with her twin sister. Informed of Maddy's strong fan base, Lewington commented How lovely I think it's because she's identifiable. People understand her motives and see that she has no hidden agenda. She's emotional but strong, cheeky but kind. I rather like her so I'm glad others do to In October 2007, drinks' industry body the Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about a scene in Holby City episode Trial and Retribution , which depicted the characters Maddy and Sam Strachan each taking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show the negative consequences of this action, the series was presenting a highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking . The Daily Telegraph noted that the complaint came shortly after Home Secretary Jacqui Smith expressed concern about televisual glorification of drunkenness, having told the Labour Party conference such a thing would be branded unacceptable as part of a zero tolerance approach to anti social behaviour. In response to the Portman Group's accusation that We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes , the BBC released a statement explaining that Holby City takes the issue of the negative effects of alcohol abuse very seriously. On occasions when our continuing drama series deal with alcohol within a storyline we always seek to handle the issue sensitively . The series 10 episode Love Will Tear Us Apart , which saw Maddy stood up by Dan on a return visit from France, was selected as a televisual pick of the day by The Guardian, the Daily Mirror, and the Birmingham Mail. The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing Now here's an idea for another Holby spin off one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra departmental shagging that goes on in that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, with not a look in for characters who aren't actually on staff. Here, sexist surgeon Clifford returns to complicate Maddy's life, though since she's been sleeping with Sam, who's slept with Connie, Chrissie and Faye, she appears to need no help in that area.She's going to die. The Sun journalist Anita Baig has also commented critically on the character, noting that when it comes to medicine, Maddy always seems to be having difficulties. Daily Mirror critic Jim Shelley has discussed the outlandish nature of the character's storylines, dubbing the line I don't know why people complain about the NHS from a 2007 episode his 'Naive statement of the week', explaining Hmmmm let's see. Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth Robert Powell keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A E department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly fixed her dad's breathalyser test. Anyone detect a theme emerging Shelley has, however, also deemed Maddy to be one of Holby City's few really good, realistic, characters . The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of Hung Up by Madonna. Although the character had not yet made her on screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield Dan Clifford and Phoebe Thomas Maria Kendall who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola Kyla Tyson and Phoebe Thomas Maria Kendall provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke Lola Griffin , who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances I had the time of my life...Woo hoo Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've got a little bit of history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers Sam Strachan , Duncan Pow Linden Cullen and Robert Powell Mark Williams .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddy%20Young
"Mahonri Mackintosh Young August 9, 1877 November 2, 1957 was an American social realist sculptor and artist. During his lengthy career, he created more than 320 sculptures, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. However, he is primarily recognized for his sculpture. His work includes landscapes, portraits, busts, life size sculptures, monuments, and engravings. Regardless of his medium of choice, his work is characterized by spontaneity he often preferred to prepare his work with quick sketches on the scene. He felt this made his work more natural as compared to using a model in the studio. He was fairly commercially successful during his life, though he did not find success until his mid 30s. Large commissions for sculptures from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church were particularly lucrative for him. Born into a family of rich Mormon pioneer heritage, Young was the grandson of the second President of the LDS Church and first Governor of Utah, Brigham Young. Young was introduced to art by his father at an early age he did his first sculpture at the age of five. He quit school at seventeen years old and worked engraving and portrait making jobs at various newspapers in Salt Lake City to make money for art lessons and for art school in New York and later, Paris. He lived most of his life in New York City where he became associated with The Eight and the Ashcan School. He ignited his commercial success in New York however, arguably two of his most famous works, the This Is The Place Monument and the Seagull Monument are featured prominently in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of his other well known works is a statue of Brigham Young which resides at the Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. At various times during his career, Young taught at the Art Students League. Most of Young's work resides at Brigham Young University. Mahonri Mackintosh Young was born on August 9, 1877 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the oldest child of Mahonri Moriancumer Young, owner of Deseret Woolen Mill which he had inherited from his father Brigham Young, and Agnes Mackintosh. Young enjoyed the time he spent living in rural Utah at the factory he considered this his golden age in Utah. Young was given the name of his father, named after the character Mahonri Moriancumer from the Book of Mormon, widely known as the Brother of Jared . Moriancumer was omitted due to its peculiarity and was, instead, replaced by Mackintosh, his mother's maiden name. His grandfather, Brigham Young, was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church , governor of Utah territory in 1851, and director of the Mormon pioneers to Utah. Mahonri Mackintosh was likely the last grandchild born before the death of Brigham Young on August 29 and the last to receive a blessing from him. Young's mother came from a polygamist marriage in the Midwestern United States. Though she did not meet her father, Daniel Mackintosh until she was older than one, he died when she was three years old and her mother raised her alone. Young's parents had attended the University of Deseret now University of Utah together. They married in October 1876 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. After their marriage, Agnes's mother Ellen moved into their home. Young's twin brothers, Winfield Scott Winnie and Waldemar Wally were born on July 1, 1880 they grew to be successful, a newspaperman and a screenwriter respectively. While ill with appendicitis, his father introduced Young to sculpture by carving objects for him out of wood. For his safety, his father gave him clay to model animals, sparking his interest in art at a young age. Young's father died when he was about seven years old. His father's death provided Young with the motivation to become a successful sculptor. His mother never remarried but was forced to sell the factory for less than half its worth due to financial concerns. Despite this, Agnes was able to provide for the living expenses of her family. His family moved into a small house in Salt Lake City where Young began school. At eleven years old, his mother bought him a woodcarving kit from which he carved a four inch bas relief of Julius Caesar from a fence post. After seeing the piece, a book salesman called him a genius , leading his family to call him the genius . Due to mediocre grades and always feeling behind his classmates, Young quit school after eighth grade. He spent time reading and studying about art, making friends with other young, aspiring artists. His childhood friends included John Held Jr. and Lee Greene Richards. He created his first sculpture when he was thirteen. At a young age, Young found formal education to be a waste of time. Young said that the only thing he learned that was of any value to him was that he should look at the point where a line would end rather than the point of the pencil. However, despite his disinterest in formal education, he read avidly with favorite authors being Ralph Waldo Emerson and Montaigne. Early influences from the Mormon families around him led him to be disinterested in maintaining LDS Church activity. Examples of these influences included abuse of the law of plural marriage and excessive piety among church members. Young was athletic and participated in baseball and football teams. However, after an injury during a football game, he broke his left arm and after it was incorrectly reset and then rebroken to be properly set, his left arm remained slightly smaller than his right for the entirety of his life. His early interest in athletics influenced the subject of his art, as he often sculpted and depicted athletes competing in various sports, the most prominent sport being boxing. He also developed his interest in nature and bird watching which further influenced themes and subjects of his art. His uncle introduced Young to ranch life, in which he became extremely interested. His mother was adamant that he pursue a different career. Although Young did not become a rancher, themes of ranching and the American West were frequent in his art. Young learned about the art style of Jean Francois Millet from reading magazines, which taught him about form, space, light, and movement in art. An article about Millet convinced Young to quit school, get a job, and take art lessons. Determined to become a sculptor, Young realized that he had not sculpted since he was five years old, so he decided he may have better luck being an illustrator. Rather than attend ninth grade, Young chose to pursue an artistic education under local artist James Taylor Harwood, John Hafen, and Edwin Evans. He had initially applied to the University of Utah, but his application was denied because he had not graduated high school. Instead, Young worked in a curio shop and a stationary shop to make money for lessons with Harwood. However, he was delayed in attending lessons due to a necessary appendectomy. Harwood was unimpressed by Young, believing that he was a lazy artist and did not work hard. Young's philosophy, however, was that there is no virtue in working hard, but rather thinking hard. Furthermore, Young liked to quickly sketch an observation which he would later turn into a drawing, but being a traditionalist, Harwood viewed this technique as cheating and an artistic crime . Although Young had not yet sculpted in class, one day, Young and a classmate sculpted the mask of Laocoon with details from the David and Laughing Faun. Young was not trained in sculpture and had not sculpted since he was five years old. Despite his lack of experience, his instructors praised his sculptures and his natural talent. However, he would not sculpt again until he studied in Paris. Young saved money earned as a Salt Lake Tribune portrait artist, but took his subsequent demotion to an engraver as a blow to his ego. Using the money he saved, he attended the Art Students League of New York between 1899 and 1901. In New York, Young was fascinated by the Industrial Revolution and decided that he would make art to reflect the themes of the Industrial Revolution. At the Art Students League, Young took classes with George Bridgeman and Kenyon Cox. He began using realist techniques he would look at artistic models quickly and then attempt to draw his or her memorized features. Although Young disliked Bridgeman as an instructor, Young maintained a spot as second in the class. In contrast, Young greatly admired Cox as an instructor. During his time in New York, he suffered from insomnia, which he attempting to remedy by reading Shakespeare and magazines. Young lived on a tight budget and spent most of his time studying or attending art exhibits. After running out of money, Young had to return to Salt Lake City after eight months instead of his intended nine. In Salt Lake City, Young worked for the Salt Lake Herald as an engraver and did some drawings for Deseret News. Even though he contracted the Spanish flu, Young became manager of the photoengraving shop for the Herald and saved enough money to travel to Paris, France in 1901 to study at the Academie Julian. Young received extra money to study from his mother who had arranged for a settlement of a part of Brigham Young's estate as well as donations from family and members of the LDS Church. He studied until 1905, where he studied with Jean Paul Laurens and Jean Antoine Injalbert. Unimpressed by the traditional styles taught in Paris, Young did not believe he learned anything at the Academie in France until 1903, when he was able to work more independently and develop his realistic style. He started studying painting and after achieving personal goals painting and after more artistic education from a trip to Italy, he returned to studying sculpture and etching in 1903. Young indicated that one must learn to be thick skinned in class to be able to withstand the criticism of both professors and other students. Most of his instruction in anatomy came from independent study of books. He found that he could not stomach anatomy classes at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, not because of cadavers, because he had not yet made it to that point in the lectures, but because of the overwhelming stench of unshowered students and sweat which gave him unbearable headaches. Young's most important etching in Paris was The Forge Rue St. Jacque. It was exhibited in 1903, bringing public attention to Young's etchings. His first original sculptures, The Shoveler and The Man Tired were completed in 1903. Young did not agree with the use of models in his sculpting, because he believed it took away from the naturalness of the piece. For his sculptures, he found that sketches and observation over time made for more natural results and a better depiction of motion. He nervously sent Man Tired and The Shoveler to the American Art Association show in 1903 and achieved great success. His sculptures were featured in the Paris Herald in an article about the American Art Association show. His sculptures were sent to the New Salon in Paris for liberal art, were placed in the main gallery, and received critical acclaim. He spent all of his time looking at art in exhibitions or sketching on the street which garnered him criticism from his classmates for being lazy. Young, however, felt that he could learn more by observing rather than by working and studying in the studio. During the summer of 1903, Young returned to Salt Lake City, having run out of money. In Salt Lake City, Young continued to sketch. Fortunately for Young, his mother borrowed enough money for him to spend another two years studying in Paris. In New York, on his way to Paris, Young participated in an amateur boxing match and broke his thumb which prevented him from sculpting for a few months, so he attempted water coloring instead. He had some modeled drawings hung in the Paris Old Salon, which led him to experiment drawing with more models. His model Bovet Arthur was displayed in the New Salon. Young frequently used this man Bovet Arthur as a model for his work while he was in Paris. Young did a parody piece called The Toilet, but it was never exhibited, and Young destroyed it in 1905. He destroyed some other work that was not accepted to salons. He later admitted regretting destroying his work and never destroyed another piece. Heber J. Grant, president of the LDS European Church mission at the time, gave Young money to cast some of Young's statues in bronze. During his last two years studying in France, he visited galleries and studios of well known artists. Continuing to develop his style of realism, Mahonri Young was one of the first young American sculptural realists. Mahonri Young returned to Utah in 1905, needing to find a way to make a living. Due to his lack of success and financial troubles, Young considered years 1905 to 1910 his five years of exile . His first commission was a butter sculpture for Frost Creamery for the Utah State Fair called The Dairy Maid. Later, Young established a mildly successful art class at the YMCA, but the class was canceled after one of his students started an art club that took away his students in 1906. He managed to maintain some private lessons. Young hoped to make a commission by making and selling a bust of B.H. Roberts, but he did not have money to bronze it until 1908. However, Robert's first wife refused to buy the bust because it did not adequately portray her husband's personality. Young finally received more commission when he and Lee Greene Richards completed a mural for the Isis Movie Theatre, using themselves as models for the characters. This was the first outside mural done in Utah and the only one done by Young. However, news stories about the murals kept being killed, leading Young to believe there was a conspiracy against realist artists. However, there were few career prospects in the United States, as the art scene was dominated by conservative juries who were unwilling to take a chance on unknown artists and were uninterested in unique or groundbreaking styles. Museums and exhibitionists wanted to showcase academic art and did not want to showcase American art. Consequently, Young found it difficult to sell or exhibit his work in the United States. He found little success during his first five years back in the United States. However, a group of realists from the Ashcan School called The Eight hosted an independent exhibition in 1908 in Philadelphia, igniting the success realist artists could find in the United States. Young improved his reputation by making a bust of Alfred Lambourne. In early 1907, the LDS Church granted Mahonri Young permission to create a life size sculpture of Joseph Smith, the first president of the LDS Church, using his death mask. After the LDS Church rejected his work, Young offered to redo the piece and make an additional statue of Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith's brother. These statues were accepted and currently reside on Temple Square. Despite financial troubles, Young married Cecelia Sharp on February 19, 1907. Young had initially seen Sharp while both in Paris where Sharp had been studying piano they had not yet met and Sharp had to travel back to Utah due to her father's health began to fail. In Utah, they attended the same LDS Church where Sharp's father was a bishop, but they had not yet met because Sharp was five years older than Young. Young and Sharp met in 1906 while Sharp was giving private piano lessons in Salt Lake City and fell in love. Young made a bust of Sharp in 1906. Polished and beautiful, the bust was different than anything he created during his career. Young and Sharp's first child, Cecelia Agnes Young, known as Agnes or Aggie , was born on April 25, 1908. Continually aware of the revolt of The Eight , Young traveled to New York in 1908 and 1909 to determine whether he could be successful in New York. After he presented an idea to construct a Seagull Monument to the LDS Church, they were excited about the project, but were unable to fund it. He instead sculpted a frieze to go above the LDS Gymnasium. This was the last project he completed in Utah before he moved to New York. Young felt that he could relate to the styles and the goals of The Eight , so he and his family moved to New York in 1910. In New York, Young was a founding member of the Society of American Etchers. He did not find success until 1912, which was a turning point in his career. In 1911, Young won the Helen Foster Barnett prize for Bovet Arthur a Laborer, displayed at the National Academy. His first New York exhibition was held in 1912. Stevedore was shown at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the same year, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate. Moreover, in 1912, Young proposed the Seagull Monument to the LDS Church a second time, stressing the personal importance of the monument to Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church Charles W. Nibley. The LDS Church offered Young a contract for the completion of the Seagull Monument, offering him a 200 per month advance for his living expenses. Mahonri Bill Sharp Young was born on July 23, 1911, in New York. Following the Seagull contract, Young was offered a contract to create art for a Hopi Indian exhibition for the American Museum of Natural History. He visited Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to get inspiration and then returned to New York to complete the project with his colleague Howard MacCormick. Young was offered some commission to create dioramas for Navajo and Apache tribes as well. The Seagull Monument was unveiled and dedicated on Temple Square on October 1, 1913. A member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and because of the similar artistic goals and interests, Young became friends with some members of the Ashcan School and joined them in arranging the 1913 Armory show, which sought to introduce patrons to new styles and movements in art. The Armory show included realism and introduced more abstract styles such as Cubism. Young disliked abstract art styles. In fact, Young believed the emerging styles of surrealism and abstract expressionism that began to appear later in his life were a greater threat than Communism . In 1915, he featured nine pieces at the Panama Pacific International Exposition where he was awarded the silver medal. Young's Apache sculptures were unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History in 1916. Cecelia Sharp died of cancer in 1917 after which Young returned to Paris to continue studying art. He resided in Paris from 1925 to 1927. In Paris, he taught students, one of whom was Mary Tarleton. Tarleton and Young maintained a romantic relationship for a few years. Tarleton, 27 years his junior, confessed her love to Young but refused his many marriage proposals. Their relationship and consistent correspondence came to an end in 1930. In 1923, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Academician. In 1924, Young unveiled his Navajo statues at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1926, E. W. Marland commissioned a statue of a pioneer woman he invited twelve artists to submit sculptures to be considered for the monument. Young submitted a sculpture but lost to Bryant Baker. Young considered this the greatest disappointment of his career. Young's statues of Prize Ring boxer bronzes were shown at the Rehn Galleries in New York in 1928, their first exhibition. In 1929, Young crafted a bronze of Joe Gans for Winfield Sheehan, a Fox Film executive at the time. Young married Dorothy Weir, daughter of painter J. Alden Weir on February 17, 1931 and promptly moved to the Weir family farm in Connecticut. Young maintained a studio at the Weir estate which has become Weir Farm National Historic Site. Young first met Weir at 1921 at a dinner to discuss plans for the Phillips Memorial Gallery, one of the books for the gallery was intended to be dedicated to Weir's father. When Young returned to Paris to teach and work on his art from 1925 to 1927, they were reacquainted and became friends. After returning to New York, Young proposed marriage to Weir a few times, but she hesitated having never been married and feeling responsibility to care for her aging stepmother. In 1932, Young competed in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics with eight boxing statues. The Knockdown, which he had sculpted in the 1920s in Paris, won the gold medal for sculpture. In 1934, he began teaching at the Art Students League. The same year, his etching Pont Neuf was featured in Fine Prints of the Year, 1933. In 1941 Life magazine called him the George Bellows of American sculpture. Industry and Agriculture , a statue of factory worker with tools and a statue of a farmer sharpening his blade, were displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These large sculptures stood at the fair's entrance. Mahonri Young had a unique relationship with the LDS Church. Since his teenage years, he did not attend church, follow the Word of Wisdom, or pay tithing to the LDS Church. However, he did admire several LDS Church leaders and was proud of his pioneer heritage. Despite his lack of activity in the LDS Church, he lobbied heavily to work on several projects for the church. Largely considered to be his most important artistic work, Young was especially proud of This Is The Place Monument located at This Is the Place Heritage Park in the foothills of Salt Lake City. The most artistically significant relief on the monument depicts the Donner Party. The monument was intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brigham Young and the Mormon's arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. As early as 1935, a committee had been chosen to consider artists' proposals of the monument. Young did extensive research and sketching for the project, confident he would be awarded the chance to create the monument. After lobbying the committee for almost five months, he returned to New York, frustrated that he had not yet secured the project. He decided to lobby U.S. Senators from Utah to gained federal funding for the project which offended committee member John D. Giles. Giles told Young that he could not give him a contract because they were waiting on funding from the LDS Church however, Giles was actually stalling time to find a different artist to complete the project. The committee decided to make the monument proposal a competition, which worried Young because of his experience with the Pioneer Woman Competition. John Fairbanks, a younger artist, had already completed prominent statues and memorials for the LDS Church he was Young's fiercest competition. LDS President Heber J. Grant chose Young's design in 1939, because it highlighted prominent figures Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Wilford Woodruff rather than a covered wagon, as in the Fairbanks design. Young was awarded 50,000 to build the monument in 1939 when he was 62 years old. After he was granted the contract, many of the artistic qualities sought by Young were vetoed by representatives from Utah state government, the LDS Church, and descendants of pioneers. For example, Young wanted pioneer leaders in realistic clothing like they would have worn when entering the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. However, Young's vision of leaders like Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball in suspenders and bloomers was deemed undignified. Instead, pioneer leaders were portrayed in heavy formal overcoats. Young worked on the statues at Weir farm, assisted by Spero Anargyros. The monument was dedicated on July 24, 1947, on the one hundredth anniversary of Brigham Young's party reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley. It is the largest sculpted monument in Utah. Even though Young was paid 50,000 for the monument, he believed that he was owed 11,000 extra according to the terms of the contract. He was angry when he was denied the money and eventually became frustrated enough to write to the president of the LDS Church George A. Smith directly. George Q. Morris of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles severely reprimanded Young for contacting Smith and Young was never paid the extra 11,000. Young resented this alleged contract breach for the rest of his life. In 1947, Young was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Dorothy Weir died on May 28, 1947. Young continued to live there after her death. His last major work was for the State of Utah. He created a six foot monument of Brigham Young seated for the Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol Building. The work was unveiled in Washington D.C. in 1950. He carved this work at the American Academy in Rome, Italy. During a visit to Utah in the same year, he was made an honorary member of the Sons of Utah Pioneers Club. In 1955, Young participated in the Armory Show Commemorative Exhibition in New York City. In January 1957, Young had a serious stroke and in October 1957, he had an ulcer attack. Young died in Norwalk, Connecticut on November 2, 1957, from the result of bleeding ulcers complicated by pneumonia he was eighty years old. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery at the Young family plot, next to Cecelia Young. Although Mahonri Young was taught the classical style which prevailed in the French art institutes of the time, and was surrounded by colleagues who sought to reject the classical style with impressionistic and post impressionistic styles, Young was disinterested in depicting idyllic or naturalistic images and was more concerned with depicting the realities of life that surrounded him. Consequently, Young's work is often associated with social realism, as his work depicted laborers, immigrants, minorities, the West, and man's interaction with nature. At the time, Young felt isolated by his traditionalist instructors and colleagues who penned Young's work as dishonest . The size of his work ranged from larger monuments to small sculptures which he typically did in the social realist style. His most recurring subject matter included animals, Native Americans, the boxing ring, ranch life, and laborers. Young greatly admired the work of Cyrus Dallin and Young's work often had parallels to that of Dallin's. Mahonri Young was versatile in his subject matter and methods, yet his works were united in powerful elegance . He was proficient in various mediums and techniques such as etching, drawing, watercolor, oil, gouache, and sculpture, which included his lesser known work on medals and reliefs. Even though he is known for his sculpture, he always kept a sketchbook with him and would use pen and ink, oil, and watercolor to depict scenes he saw on the farm. However while art critic, Frank Jewett Mather praised Young's drawings, etchings, and sculpture, he qualified Young's painting as average, suggesting that Young may have commenced painting at too old of an age or perhaps did not approach it with the same effort and care with which he approached his other mediums. Additionally, compared Young's work to that of Jean Francois Millet, Honore Daumier, and Constantin Meunier. Though Young vehemently denied it, some critics accused Young of imitating Millet's work. Young's work, particularly his earlier pieces, was also heavily influenced by Auguste Rodin. Young's sculpture of fighting boxers, Right to the Jaw is characteristic of Rodin's style with its curves and opposing diagonal movements. Young's experience as a sketch artist for the Salt Lake Tribune gave him a spontaneous style that he believed benefited his art. Young excelled in depicting figures in motion and the psychological nuances of gesture . Rather than emphasize light, appearance, and technical skill as had prevailed in traditionalist art, Young preferred to emphasize rhythm, balance, movement, form, and design. Mahonri Young's career lasted more than fifty years with his works displayed in over fifty museums and galleries in the United States and Europe. Upon his death, his estate constituted 320 pieces of sculpture, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. Young was the first Utah artist to have his work displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Moreover, Young received nearly every award offered to artists in Utah. The Springville Museum of Art called Young Utah's most famous New York based artist . According to the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Young gained a national reputation for his sculpture and graphic art. Guy Pene du Bois said, Mahonri Young belongs among...those who of the strain of Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens, Goya, Renoir, and Millet...he is a rare sculptor in America . Young was a member of the American Watercolor Society. In 1940, the Addison Gallery of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibit of Young's various works. In 1999, the Brigham Young University Museum of Art in Provo, Utah opened a year long exhibition of Mahonri Young's work called Mahonri A Song of Joys . The Young family donated over 7,000 various works of Young to Brigham Young University. Additionally, the BYU Museum of Art held an exhibition of Young's work during summer 2019.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahonri%20Young
"Mary Alice Young previously Angela Forrest is a fictional character from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The character was created by television producer and screenwriter Marc Cherry and is portrayed by Brenda Strong, who also serves as the narrator of the series from beyond the grave the character's suicide in the pilot episode served as the catalyst of the series. The narration provided by Mary Alice is essential to the tale of Wisteria Lane, as the series revolves around her sharing the secrets of her friends and neighbors. Her narration technique is akin in style to Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology 1915 . Mary Alice is considered the most mysterious of the housewives as only parts of her story are known. A loving, doting wife and mother who was generous to her family and neighbours, she was the last person any of them expected to commit suicide. In death, Mary Alice sees things she would not have seen when she was alive her friends' vulnerabilities, lies, and secrets. She does not judge them so much as love them more because of their foibles, pitying them for the ways they manipulate and hurt those they care about most. Although deceased since the pilot episode, Mary Alice continued to have a leading storyline throughout the first and second seasons of the series, with the story being led by her husband Paul Young Mark Moses and son Zach Cody Kasch . Thereafter, Strong continued to make sporadic appearances as Mary Alice in flashbacks, dreams and as a ghost to other characters while narrating almost every episode of the series. Strong was the subject of acclaim for both her portrayal and narration as the character, with some critics describing her voice as one of the most recognizable on television at the end of the series. She was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice Over Performance for her narration as Mary Alice and received two Screen Actors Guild Awards as a cast member of Desperate Housewives. In Marc Cherry's first script for the pilot of Desperate Housewives, the character was originally named Mary Alice Scott, but he was later forced to change the character's surname when the series was picked up by ABC. In the book Desperate Housewives Behind Closed Doors, a companion to the first season of the series, he explained We changed Mary Alice Scott to Mary Alice Young because we couldn't get the name cleared with our lawyers. If over three people in the country have that name you're fine but with anything less than that, they make you use a different name. Apparently there was one Mary Alice Scott in the country. The role of Mary Alice was originally given to Sheryl Lee, who portrayed the character in the original pilot that was filmed for ABC, but Lee was soon replaced by Strong after Cherry and the producers decided that Lee was not right for the part. Marcia Cross, who would later be cast as Bree Van de Kamp, also expressed interest in Mary Alice, but after reading for the part Cherry insisted that she read for Bree instead. Strong explained in Desperate Housewives Behind Closed Doors that she believed there to be a conceptual shift after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and they realized they needed something different , stating There certainly wasn't something wrong with what did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, he opened his eyes and this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.' The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it. Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode My Husband, the Pig in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp and the fifth season episode Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt . Strong, describing the way Mary Alice's storyline influenced the remainder of the series 2011 The mystery surrounding Mary Alice and her family was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted there to be a definite end to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill Deirdre Taylor Jolie Jenkins , the woman whose child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice and her family do not have much of a leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was going to be back with an attitude , stating She will be a little less surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier. During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree Marcia Cross . Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an extraordinary opportunity , saying In a way, Mary Alice becomes Bree's conscience and her guide and her muse in knowing what to do with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot. In the pilot episode, Mary Alice introduces herself as the stereotypical American housewife to husband Paul Young Mark Moses and son Zach Cody Kasch . On one Thursday, she proceeds to go to her hall closet to retrieve a revolver, and shoot herself in the head with it. Paul asks Mary Alices neighbors and friends, Susan Teri Hatcher , Lynette Felicity Huffman , Bree Marcia Cross and Gabrielle Eva Longoria , to go through her clothes and other belongings and then pack them up, as he thinks it will be too hard for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, I know what you did, it makes me sick, Im going to tell. Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alices past and her possible motives for ending her life she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine Sam Lloyd where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may have had something to do with a baby that went missing. Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber Christine Estabrook , whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer Andrea Bowen , Susans daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive. Felicia Tilman Harriet Sansom Harris , Marthas sister, soon arrives on Wisteria Lane to find out what happened to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alices house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alices suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor Jolie Jenkins , a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdres body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicias house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdres child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide. Mary Alice appears in flashbacks and dream sequences in the remainder of the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice was the first of the housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her she tells her that we cant prevent what we cant predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair Dana Delany was first living on Wisteria Lane in Now You Know , she and Susan knock on Katherines door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In Free , Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan Hailee Denham the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing. In season five, Mary Alice appears in multiple flashbacks in The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened , including when handyman Eli Scruggs Beau Bridges was first starting out and approached Mary Alice on the street, asking her if she had any work for him. After initially declining, she notices a hole in his shoe and says she has a broken vase that he can glue back together for her. Years later, on the day Mary Alice committed suicide, Eli was at her house dropping something off. He asks if she is all right, to which she says she is, and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is all right, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. In season six, Mary Alice again appears in a flashback in Epiphany , when she notices four year old Eddie Orlofsky Davin Ransom witnessing his father leave their family. Mary Alice continues to check on Eddie and his mother Barbara Diane Farr , bringing them a hot meal and later to bring a teddy bear for Eddie, where she finds the young child left home alone. Mary Alice finds Barbara in a bar, brings her home and scolds her for her poor parenting skills. In season eight, Mary Alice appears in several flashbacks and as a ghost. In Making the Connection , it is revealed that she contemplated calling her friends for advice and support after receiving the blackmail note, but ultimately chose not to and then committed suicide. In Putting It Together , Mary Alice appears as a ghost to a suicidal Bree, who asks her if she remembers how happy their lives were on Wisteria Lane when she was alive and if she is happy now, to which Mary Alice says she is not unhappy. The series finale opens with the day Mary Alice arrived on Wisteria Lane. Martha is the first to greet her, and when Mary Alice seems unwilling to talk about where she is from, Martha guesses she has a secret and makes it her mission from that day forward to figure out what it is. At the end of the episode, Mary Alice's spirit is seen with the ghosts of those who have died over the years on Wisteria Lane, explaining her presence all this time has been in the hopes that they can give a message to those left behind that while their lives may be desperate, they are still worth living. Both the character and her role as narrator were generally well received by critics throughout the series, and for which Strong received nominations for multiple accolades. In his review of the pilot, Tom Shales of The Washington Post complimented Mary Alice character's narrations, writing Even though narration has become the most overused technique in prime time television needed, perhaps, to help move the narrative along quickly now that hour length shows have shrunk to as little as 41 minutes plus commercials , the producers of Desperate Housewives use it well, and Strong's uncomplaining perkiness adds yet another layer of irony to the enterprise. Peter Schorn of IGN commended Strong's narrations as well as the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide, calling the character's dark secret the McGuffin that powers this first season . Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Mary Alice's suicide scene as mysterious and somber but mostly funny , pointing out that the soundtrack music remains light and happy throughout and likened the character's narration to that of Glenn Close in Reversal of Fortune 1990 . Celia Wren, also writing for The Washington Post, confirmed that the idyllic small town setting of Desperate Housewives as well as Mary Alice's narration style as a deceased and omniscient narrator were influenced by Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology 1915 , for which she complimented the series, writing There's a lot of material to work with Masters's poetic portrait gallery from 1915 gets its oomph from blowtorching the concept of idyllic small town America. Its largely embittered personalities speak from beyond the grave of murders, seductions, suicides, hypocrisies, political corruptionenough scandalous behavior to make Desperate Housewives look like Little Women. While reviewing the first season finale, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly praised the resolution to the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's death, calling it both shocking and satisfying. On the other hand, Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was negative in her review and criticized the writers' decision to devoting too much of the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. Tanner Stransky, also writing for the magazine, wrote that the producers artfully blended the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide with hot button and often titillating plotlines throughout the series' first season. In an article celebrating the tenth anniversary of the airing of the series' pilot episode, Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post complimented the many layers of Mary Alice and her family's mystery and likened it as just as captivating as the first season of Lost. In 2009, Stransky was favorable of both Strong's narration and performance in the fifth season episode The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened , describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as heartbreaking and writing I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, but it was so nice to see her on screen again That lady can act. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode Epiphany , believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of Lane and politely promise to keep in touch and visit, Mary Alice Brenda Strong takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know They wont keep in touch, and they wont visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality. Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming one of the most familiar on television . As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as everybody's favorite deceased housewife omniscient narrator in 2014. For her narration as Mary Alice, Strong was twice nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice Over Performance in 2011 and 2012. Additionally, as a cast member of Desperate Housewives, she twice received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, among five consecutive nominations for the award between 2005 and 2009.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%20Alice%20Young
"Neil James Young 17 February 1944 3 February 2011 was an English footballer who made more than 400 appearances in the Football League playing as a striker for Manchester City, Preston North End and Rochdale. In total, Young scored 86 goals from 334 League games for Manchester City, scored the only goal in the 1969 FA Cup Final, and scored as City won the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. Transferred to Preston North End for 48,000 during the 197172 season, he made 68 League appearances and scored 18 goals for the Deepdale club before finishing his senior career with Rochdale, where he spent the 197475 season. Young was born in Fallowfield, Manchester, where he lived with his parents and older brother Chris. His house was half a mile from Manchester City's Maine Road ground, which was visible from the bedroom window. As a schoolboy he played for Manchester Boys, facing opponents who were two years older. After catching the eye of scout Harry Godwin, Young signed for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1959, turning down the opportunity to join Manchester United. Around this time he was capped by England at youth level. He turned professional in July 1960, and made his first team debut in November 1961, in a 21 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. After breaking into the team for the first time, Young played every match in the remainder of the 196162 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 December 1961, in a 30 home win against Ipswich Town. He finished his first season with 11 goals in 26 appearances. Young's first full season was not a successful one for Manchester City the team struggled to find form throughout. A four match unbeaten run in April, in which Young scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but on the final day of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to be a regular first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 196465 season. Manchester City did not come close to promotion, and their 11th place finish in 1965 was at that point the lowest in the club's history. Manager George Poyser departed in April 1965, and in July 1965 his replacement, Joe Mercer, joined the club, along with coach Malcolm Allison. Young missed the start of the 196566 season with an illness that resulted in a tonsillectomy. He marked his return to the team with two goals against Coventry City. Up until this point in his career, Young had usually played on the left wing. However, encouraged by Mercer and Allison to shoot more frequently, his position began to vary. Against Leyton Orient, Young was deployed as an inside forward, and scored a hat trick. He also played inside forward in an FA Cup tie against Leicester City, and scored the winning goal against a team from the division above. By January, Manchester City were top of the Second Division. The club only lost one match in the remainder of the season, and won the Second Division Championship by a five point margin. Young finished as the club's highest goalscorer, with 17 goals. Manchester City returned to the First Division for the 196667 season, and Young remained a key player. Before Manchester City's game against Leeds United, Leeds manager Don Revie, known for his meticulous scouting of opposition teams, identified Young as a particular threat in a Grandstand interview. Operating mainly on the wing, Young scored less frequently than in the previous season, with 7 goals in 45 appearances. Manchester City finished the 196667 season in mid table, and continued in a similar vein at the start of the 196768 season, failing to win in their first three matches. A tactical switch saw Young and Mike Summerbee moved inside, and Young scored two goals in City's first win of the season, 42 against Southampton. Four more wins followed immediately, including a 20 win against Newcastle United in which Young scored a goal and missed a penalty. Young remained at inside forward for the rest of the season. Following the arrival of striker Francis Lee and a long unbeaten run, Manchester City entered the New Year as potential title contenders. In mid March, a 51 win against Fulham in which Young scored two goals took Manchester City top of the table. The lead changed hands several times in the following six weeks, but as the teams entered the final round of fixtures, Manchester City travelled to Newcastle knowing a win would guarantee the championship. Young scored twice and had another disallowed as Manchester City won 43 to win the title, the first major honour of Young's career. Young also finished the season as the club's highest goalscorer with 20 goals. The following season, Manchester City did not challenge for the title. However, they found more success in the FA Cup. Young played in every round as the club reached the 1969 FA Cup Final. The opponents in the final were Leicester City. As Leicester were struggling against relegation Manchester City were strong favourites. However, the game was a close affair. Midway through the first half, Mike Summerbee crossed the ball from the right, and Young hit a left foot shot past Peter Shilton into the roof of the net. The match finished 10, Young's goal winning the Cup for Manchester City. Cup success continued in 196970. The club reached and won the League Cup Final, though Young, who had played in all but one of the preceding rounds, was left out of the team for the final. A second final followed a month later, this time in European competition in the form of the European Cup Winners' Cup. City faced Polish club Gornik Zabrze in the final, held at Prater Stadium in Vienna. Young scored the opening goal, from a rebound after a save by Hubert Kostka. Shortly before half time Young was fouled in the penalty area by Kostka, and Francis Lee scored the resulting penalty. City won the match 21 to become the first English team to win a European and domestic trophy within the same season. In late 1970, Young's brother, Chris died aged 31, an event which affected Young deeply. His performances for Manchester City suffered as a result. He played approximately half the matches in the 197071 season, scoring only two goals. In the following season, he featured only rarely, and made his last appearance for the club on 16 October 1971, as a substitute against Leeds United. In total, Young scored 86 goals from 334 league games for Manchester City. He was transferred to Second Division club Preston North End for 48,000 during the 197172 season. He made his debut for the club in a 00 draw against Birmingham City. He made 68 league appearances and scored 18 goals for the Deepdale club, but left after the club were relegated in the 197374 season. He finished his senior career with Rochdale, where he spent the 197475 season. Young, widely regarded as one of Manchester City's most important players of the modern era, though not as celebrated nationally as teammates Colin Bell, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee, was inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame in 2008. Young married his first wife, Margaret, when he was 19. The couple had a son and two daughters, and divorced in 1982. He also had a daughter with his second wife, Susan. Young married his third wife, Carmen, in 2003, having lived with her since 1989. After retiring from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, working in a supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, to the point where he had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed at this point in his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid 1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home. Young was diagnosed with terminal cancer in late 2010. Following a supporter campaign, Manchester City dedicated their FA Cup tie at Leicester on 9 January 2011 to Young. Supporters wore red and black the colours City wore in the 1969 final against Leicester , with proceeds from specially made scarves being split between Young and Wythenshawe Hospital. He died on 3 February 2011, just two weeks shy of his 67th birthday.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil%20Young%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29

He is considered among the best players Florida ever produceda member of the College Football Hall of Fame and one of only six Florida Gators to be named to the Gator Football Ring of Honor. After retiring as a player in 1985, Youngblood worked in the Rams' front office until 1991.

Youngblood has stated, The bonus with this therapy is that the time invested is minimal, while the results are extraordinary. Jack Youngblood was born in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Herbert J. and Kay Youngblood. He has two sisters, Paula and Lynn. Youngblood attended Monticello Jefferson County High School in Monticello, Florida, graduating in 1967. As an offensive lineman and linebacker, he was a starter on offense and defense and team captain of the state champion Tigers, earning All State honors in 1966 after recording 70 tackles. He was also All Big Bend, All Conference and the Big Bend Linemen of the Year and the Outstanding Lineman for the Tigers that season while leading a defense that shutout seven opponents and allowed ten touchdowns in 12 games, including the state playoffs. He was a four year letterman in football and also played basketball at M JC High as well as participating in 4 H, Student Council, and Key Club International. Youngblood was named to Florida's All Time High school football team by Sports Illustrated in 1989. In November 2007, he was recognized as one of the state of Florida's thirty three all time greatest high school football players when he was voted to the Florida High School Athletic Association's All Century High School football team. At the University of Florida, Youngblood was a brother of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity Alpha Omega Chapter , and was a three year varsity letterman for coach Ray Graves and coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators football teams from 1968 to 1970. Youngblood had entered school at 195 pounds and put on 10 pounds a year through weight lifting, finishing around 245 pounds. Youngblood and his teammates were part of the testing for what became Gatorade, a beverage created by doctors Robert Cade and Dana Shires, designed to help Gator athletes who had to practice and play in Central Florida heat. Said Youngblood, Dr. Cade began experimenting with Gatorade my freshman year. He tried to kill us all That first stuff was lethal It was thick, like syrup, and had an aftertaste. Then, it started to look like milk. As a freshman, Youngblood played defensive end, wearing number 52, for the Gator freshman team. It was his first experience on the defensive line, after playing linebacker in high school. As a sophomore, Youngblood played defensive end and defensive tackle recording 24 tackles and four sacks while also handling the kicking chores for the Gators, kicking a career long 42 yard field goal to provide the three point winning margin in his first collegiate game which was against Air Force. In 1969, Youngblood was part of a 911 Gators team that upset the Tennessee Volunteers in the Gator Bowl in coach Ray Graves's final game as coach at Florida. Youngblood played a key role in the Gator Bowl recording nine tackles and forcing a fumble. Youngblood first gained national attention after an October 4, 1969, five sack performance 21 6 win versus instate rival Florida State University. He set a school record for sacks 14 in 1969 and led the teams' defensive linemen with 66 tackles. In 1970, Youngblood was recognized as a first team All American, while recording 58 tackles and leading the team with 10 sacks to finish his Gator career with 29 quarterback sacks. Additionally, he was a finalist for the Outland Trophy following the 1970 season and was voted the 1970 SEC lineman of the year. Youngblood was also named to the SEC All Conference team in 1970, which ended three winning seasons while at Florida. He was also the 1970 recipient of Florida's Fergie Ferguson Award, which goes to the senior who displays outstanding leadership, character, and courage. His performance in the FloridaGeorgia rivalry earned him a spot in the FloridaGeorgia Game Hall of Fame as well. In the 1970 edition of the game, Florida trailed Georgia by seven points and the Georgia offense had driven to Florida's one yard line, Youngblood stopped a Georgia running back short of the goal line and forced him to fumble and then recovered the loose ball beginning a rally that gained a come from behind 2417 victory. Some regard Youngblood, who was considered to be an excellent pass rusher, as the best defensive lineman in Gators history as well as one of the top five players in the University of Florida's football program. When Time magazine chose him for their 1970 All America Team, it said of Youngblood Deceptively fast for his size, he reads screens and swing passes so adroitly that he intimidates quarterbacks by his mere presence. His coach Doug Dickey told The Sporting News, He is difficult to move when you run at him, has the speed and agility to pursue down the line of scrimmage, and the strength and quickness to rush the passer. In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, Youngblood was ranked as the No. 5 all time greatest player for the Florida Gators. Youngblood graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in finance in 1972. Youngblood was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the 1971 NFL Draft. He was the 20th overall pick in that draft and signed a 3 year 105,000 contract including a 30,000 signing bonus. That season, he backed up Deacon Jones at left defensive end and started four games when Jones was sidelined with a severely sprained arch. He was named All Rookie by Football Digest and after the season Jones was traded to the San Diego Chargers. In 1972, the left defensive end position was Youngblood's as he led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 70, and started 11 of the 14 games he played, recording six sacks. In 1973, Youngblood was a Second team All pro selection and went to the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16 12 sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman of the year by the Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First team All Pro and being named to his second Pro Bowl. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14 10 to the Minnesota Vikings. Youngblood was honored as the NFC Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International in 1975 and Pro Football Weekly named Youngblood the NFL defensive lineman of the year. For the third consecutive season Youngblood led the Rams in sacks 15 and was named to the Pro Bowl and a consensus All pro again, repeating his 1974 honors. In a December 1975, 35 23 playoff win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Youngblood pass rushed Cardinals offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf, penetrated into the backfield, then tipped and intercepted a pass by Jim Hart, returning the interception 47 yards for a touchdown. Later in the game, Youngblood forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Fred Dryer, blocked an extra point attempt, and sacked Hart to stop a Cardinals drive. ESPN analyst Sean Salisbury Youngblood repeated his NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1976 while co leading the Rams in sacks with 14 12, being named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl, and being a consensus first team All Pro for the third straight season. The following year, 1977, Youngblood was voted to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl and a consensus All NFC selection and second team All Pro while leading the Rams in sacks for the fifth straight season. In 1978, the Rams led the NFL in total defense and Youngblood was named to his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl and was a consensus first team All Pro for the fourth time in five years. One of the athletic feats for which Youngblood is best known, is that of playing in the 1979 playoffs, including Super Bowl XIV, with a fractured left fibula. He also played in the 1980 Pro Bowl with the injured leg, a week after the Super Bowl. In the playoffs, Youngblood sacked Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach near the sideline in the waning moments of the divisional playoff game versus the Cowboys. Playing with the fractured leg was noted by Sports Illustrated in their Top 10 list of athletes playing in pain. For that and other achievements Jack was dubbed the John Wayne of football by Jim Hanifan and echoed by Hall of Fame coach John Madden. The NFL Network series NFL Top 10 selected Youngblood's performance in the 1979 playoffs as top on its list of the Gutsiest Performances of all time. For the 1979 season, Youngblood had a career high 18 sacks and was a consensus first team All Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second team All Pro and first team All NFC while leading the Rams with 11 12 sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12 12 sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It was a result of repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record and only missed one game in his 14 year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151 12 career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop the run first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3 4 two gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled. Youngblood faced a challenge in 1983 when the Rams adopted Shurmur's 3 4 defense. Critics thought Youngblood might be too small to play that position, yet he performed in it well recording 10 12 sacks in 1983 and 9 12 sacks in 1984 while Rams were among the NFL's best defenses at stopping the run despite being considered undersized. Among the standout games in Youngblood's final two seasons were the opening game of the 1983 season, against the New York Giants in which Youngblood recorded two sacks and the 1983 season finale against the New Orleans Saints. In the Saints game Youngblood recorded 10 tackles, two sacks, recorded a safety and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by Pro Football Weekly for the effort. In Week 5 of 1984 against the New York Giants, Youngblood recorded two sacks, drew three holding calls and was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week by the NFL. Then, in Week 10, against the St. Louis Cardinals, he dominated the game sacking Neil Lomax three times and drawing three holding calls, and blocking a potential game tying field goal on the game's final play to preserve a 16 13 Rams win. His streak of consecutive games played ended in Week 15 of the 1984 season, when Youngblood had to sit out his first football game since being a collegiate player in 1970. He had suffered a ruptured disc in his lower back two weeks earlier. Despite the injury, he returned for the season finale against the 49ers and the playoffs. He attributed his ability to play to a series of back adjustments that allowed him more freedom of movement, even though team doctors told Youngblood he was out for the season and needed surgery. He was voted the Rams' recipient of the 1984 Ed Block Courage Award by representing everything that is positive about professional football and serving as an inspiration in their locker rooms being a positive role model in his communities . Though the injury ended his streak, Youngblood still holds the record for most consecutive starts in the NFL by a strong side defensive end with 184. When Youngblood retired on August 27, 1985, he asked his career to be remembered for dignity, integrity, respect and pride .

"Younger Than Yesterday is the fourth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released on February 6, 1967 on Columbia Records see 1967 in music . It saw the band continuing to integrate elements of psychedelia and jazz into their music, a process they had begun on their previous album, Fifth Dimension. In addition, the album captured the band and record producer Gary Usher experimenting with new musical textures, including brass instruments, reverse tape effects and an electronic oscillator. The album also marked the emergence of the band's bass player Chris Hillman as a talented songwriter and vocalist. Prior to Younger Than Yesterday, Hillman had only received one shared writing credit with the Byrds, but this album saw him credited as the sole composer of four songs and a co writer of So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star . Byrds expert Tim Connors has commented that two of Hillman's compositions on Younger Than Yesterday exhibited country and western influences and thus can be seen as early indicators of the country rock experimentation that would featureto a greater or lesser degreeon all of the Byrds' subsequent albums. Upon release, the album peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached number 37 on the UK Albums Chart. It was preceded by the So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star single in January 1967, which reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. Two additional singles taken from the album, My Back Pages and Have You Seen Her Face , were also moderately successful on the Billboard singles chart. However, none of the singles taken from the album charted in the United Kingdom. Music critics Richie Unterberger and David Fricke have both remarked that although it was largely overlooked by the public at the time of its release, the album's critical standing has improved over the years and today Younger Than Yesterday is considered one of the Byrds' best albums. The title of Younger Than Yesterday is derived from the lyrics of My Back Pages , a song written by Bob Dylan, which was covered on the album. The Byrds had initially come to international prominence in mid 1965, when their folk rock interpretation of Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man reached number 1 on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. Further commercial successes followed, with the band releasing two hit albums and reaching number 1 for a second time in the U.S., with a cover version of Pete Seeger's Turn Turn Turn to Everything There is a Season . Throughout the latter half of 1965, the band enjoyed tremendous popularity among teenage pop fans and their music received widespread airplay on Top 40 radio. In early 1966, the Byrds' principal songwriter, Gene Clark, departed the band, leaving Jim McGuinn, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke to complete the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, without him. Upon release, Fifth Dimension received a mixed critical reception and was less commercially successful than the band's earlier albums. As a result, the Byrds' popularity began to wane and by late 1966, they had been all but forgotten by mainstream pop audiences. Shortly after the release of Fifth Dimension, the Byrds found themselves without a record producer, when Allen Stanton, who had worked with them on that album, left Columbia Records to work for A M. The band chose to replace Stanton with Gary Usher, a former songwriting partner of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who had recently co produced Clark's debut solo album, Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers. In addition to producing the recording sessions for Younger Than Yesterday, Usher would produce the band's next two albums as well. The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan states that Usher's wealth of production experience and love of innovative studio experimentation would prove invaluable as the group entered their most creatively adventurous phase. Author David N. Howard has also remarked that despite the hodgepodge of styles and genres present on Younger Than Yesterday, Usher's studio expertise gives the album an impressively uniform consistency. Following an intensive period of rehearsal at their Sunset Boulevard headquarters, the Byrds completed the entire Younger Than Yesterday album at Columbia Studios, Hollywood, during a work intensive, eleven day period, starting on November 28 and finishing on December 8, 1966. The original working title for the LP was Sanctuary, but ultimately this was dropped in favor of a title inspired by the chorus lyrics of the album's Bob Dylan cover, My Back Pages Although Clark had left the Byrds prior to completion of the Fifth Dimension album, he did participate in the recording of the songs Eight Miles High and Captain Soul from that record. As a result, Younger Than Yesterday was the first album to be entirely recorded by the Byrds without Clark's participation. As on Fifth Dimension, guitarists McGuinn and Crosby continued to hone their songwriting skills in an attempt to fill the void left by Clark's departure. However, the most surprising development within the Byrds at this time was the emergence of bass player Chris Hillman as both a lead vocalist and the band's third songwriter. Prior to the recording of Younger Than Yesterday, Hillman had never sung lead vocals on a Byrds' recording and his only writing contribution with the band had been a shared credit for the instrumental track Captain Soul . On this album, however, he is credited as the sole songwriter of Have You Seen Her Face , Time Between , Thoughts and Words , and The Girl with No Name , with all four tracks featuring him as the lead vocalist. Hillman is also credited as the co writer of So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star , which he sings with McGuinn and Crosby. Younger Than Yesterday found the Byrds expanding their musical style in several different directions. Music critic John Harris has described the album as the Byrds' West Coastified version of the Revolver aesthetic , with reference to the Beatles' 1966 album. Chris Hillman contributed two country rock flavored songs with Time Between and The Girl with No Name , the latter of which was inspired by a young lady with the unusual moniker of Girl Freiberg. Time Between , on the other hand, was a Paul McCartney influenced pop song and the result of Hillman's first ever attempt at writing a song on his own. Both songs featured the country style guitar playing of session musician Clarence White, who would go on to become a full member of the Byrds' latter day line up from 1968 through to 1973. Byrds expert Tim Connors has suggested that the pop country sound of Time Between and The Girl with No Name like Mr. Spaceman from the band's previous album anticipated the experimentation with country music that would color the Byrds' subsequent albums. In addition to these two country tinged songs, Hillman also contributed the LSD influenced Thoughts and Words , a metaphysical meditation on human relationships that featured the sitar like sound of backwards guitar effects. A fourth Hillman penned song on the album, the British Invasion influenced Have You Seen Her Face , was considered commercial enough to be issued as a single in the U.S. some months after the release of the album. Tim Connors had remarked on his Byrdwatcher website that these four melodic, romantically themed Hillman songs brought to the album elements that had largely been missing from the band's recordings since Clark's departure. Hillman also had a hand in writing the album's opening track, So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star . With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics, the song was an acerbic, but good natured swipe at the success of manufactured pop bands like the Monkees. However, Connors has stated that So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star also suggests certain ironies due to pre fabricated aspects of the Byrds' own origin, including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks, rather than for his musical ability. As a result of this, music journalist David Fricke has said that some fans have mistaken So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star for an autobiographical song. Hillman's driving bassline and McGuinn's chiming twelve string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song, with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans, which had been recorded at a Byrds' concert in Bournemouth during the band's 1965 English tour. South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song, which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds' recording. Masekela and the Byrds would later perform So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967. McGuinn and Crosby's songs, written both separately and together, represented an expansion of the jazz influences and psychedelia that had been featured heavily on the band's previous album. The song C.T.A. 102 , named after the CTA 102 quasar and written by McGuinn and his science fiction minded friend Bob Hippard, was a whimsical, but ultimately serious song that speculated on the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. McGuinn explained the inspiration for the song in a 1973 interview with ZigZag magazine At the time we wrote it I thought it might be possible to make contact with quasars, but later I found out that they were stars which are imploding at a tremendous velocity. They're condensing and spinning at the same time, and the nucleus is sending out tremendous amounts of radiation, some of which is audible as an electronic impulse on a computerized radio telescope. It comes out in a rhythmic pattern ... and originally, the radio astronomers who received these impulses thought they were from a life form in space. Although the band's earlier song Mr. Spaceman had been thematically similar, C.T.A. 102 was a slightly more serious attempt at tackling the subject matter, highlighted by the extensive use of studio sound effects, simulated alien voices, and the sound of an electronic oscillator. Roger McGuinn explaining the creation of the alien voice effects used in the song C.T.A. 102 . Crosby's songwriting skills had also developed rapidly, with Fricke citing Renaissance Fair co written with McGuinn as an example of his increasingly wistful lyricism and writing style. The song was inspired by a visit to the Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California and Connors has described its dream like medieval ambiance as being a thematic precursor to Crosby's later song Guinnevere . Fricke has also praised the instrumental interplay between the church bell peal of Crosby and McGuinn's guitars, and Hillman's melodic, loping bass, while describing the song as a radiant evocation of a medieval festival, and by extension the sensual idealism of the hippie dream . Writing for the AllMusic website, critic Bruce Eder attempted to sum up the song's contemporary relevance by suggesting that it was a topical song every bit as tied to real events as Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth' . In addition, Eder also described Renaissance Fair as a perfect synthesis of the group's original electric folk sound evolved into a new, more contemporary form of music and songwriting, almost hippie folk music . Another of Crosby's songwriting contributions to the album was the moody, jazz influenced Everybody's Been Burned , a somber meditation on the need to find a balance between disillusionment and resolute perseverance in a relationship. Although the song was regarded by many critics as a leap forward in terms of musical sophistication upon its release, it was actually written in 1962, two years before the formation of the Byrds. Originally written as a nightclub torch song, Crosby had recorded demos of Everybody's Been Burned as early as 1963. An acoustic recording of the song by Crosby, dating from this pre Byrds period, was eventually released on the archival album Preflyte Plus in 2012. Author Johnny Rogan has stated that the Byrds' recording of the song features one of Crosby's best vocal performances and one of McGuinn's most moving guitar solos, while critic Thomas Ward described it as one of the most haunting songs in the Byrds' catalogue, and one of David Crosby's finest compositions . Crosby's ambitions for artistic control within the band were expanding along with his compositional skill, and the resulting turmoil would ultimately lead to his dismissal from the group during recording sessions for the Byrds' next album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. One source of discontent for Crosby during the recording of Younger Than Yesterday was related to the Bob Dylan cover My Back Pages . The song had been suggested as a suitable vehicle for the Byrds by their manager, Jim Dickson, but since it was the fourth song from Dylan's Another Side of Bob Dylan album that the band had covered, Crosby felt that recording My Back Pages was formulaic and a step backwards artistically. However, since the album's release, critics have praised the song as one of the Byrds' strongest Dylan interpretations. Meanwhile, Crosby insisted upon the inclusion of the contentious track Mind Gardens , which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no rhythm, meter, or rhyme . In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating, it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love. Although Mind Gardens is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self indulgent, Rogan has commented that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious. Crosby also fought to have the song Why co written with McGuinn included on the album, despite it having already been issued as the B side of the band's Eight Miles High single, some eleven months earlier. However, the version of Why included on Younger Than Yesterday was recorded during sessions for that album and is a totally different take from the previously released B side version. Exactly why Crosby insisted on resurrecting the song, when there was newer original material in reserve, remains a mystery, although the Byrds' roadie, Jimmi Seiter, has speculated that it was an attempt to increase Crosby's share of the songwriting on the album. Author Peter Lavezzoli has remarked that Why features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of Love Is Like a Heat Wave by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar. However, Rogan has described the song's Indian classical music influences as being considerably watered down on the re recording, when compared to the earlier B side version. Younger Than Yesterday was released on February 6, 1967 in the United States catalogue item CL 2642 in mono, CS 9442 in stereo and April 7, 1967 in the UK catalogue item BPG 62988 in mono, SBPG 62988 in stereo . It peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, during a stay of 24 weeks, and reached number 37 in the United Kingdom, spending a total of 4 weeks on the UK chart. The album's front cover featured a composite multiple exposure photograph of the band, taken by Frank Bez. The album was preceded by the So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star single, which was released on January 9, 1967 and reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failed to chart in the UK. Two additional singles taken from the album, My Back Pages and Have You Seen Her Face , reached number 30 and number 74 on the Billboard chart respectively, but again missed the UK chart. The My Back Pages single was the last single release by the Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, the album received mostly positive reviews from the music press, with Billboard magazine predicting that the Byrds will be riding high on the LP charts again with this top rock package. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious, noting that the album is a good one, but it would be sad if it served as a monument, marking the end of the Byrds' development. There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity. A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi Fi Stereo Review, who described the record as an enjoyable and well made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal about what is going on around us . However, the burgeoning underground press in the U.S. was less complimentary, with Richard Goldstein of The Village Voice writing that There is nothing new or startling on Younger Than Yesterday. A slightly more favorable review by Sandy Pearlman in Crawdaddy expressed some reservations, but praised the album's musical eclecticism, while noting This sound is dense, but not obviously and impressively complicated. That is, it is very coherent. It works because of its unity, not out of an accumulation of contrasting effects such as volume changes and syncopations. In the UK, journalist Penny Valentine, writing in Disc magazine, described the album as a return to form for the Byrds, before declaring that the band were back where they belong with a sound as fresh as cream and sunflowers . Melody Maker was also enthusiastic about the album, commenting, if you ignore this album you are not only foolish but deaf Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five, while Allen Evans of the NME enthused This is an exciting album, at times brash and noisy 'So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star', 'Have You Seen Her Face' , spooky the science fiction outer space sounds on 'C.T.A. 102' , folksy 'Everybody's Been Burned' , weird the irritating, monotonous backing to 'Mind Gardens' , and pleasant the soft swinging of 'The Girl with No Name' . A lot of thought has gone into this album and it's good because of it. Author Peter Buckley attempted to evaluate Younger Than Yesterday's contemporary impact more than 30 years after the fact in his 1999 book The Rough Guide to Rock The album had room for everything from Hugh Masekela's trumpet to droning sitar like riffs, a brew that may've been too rich for the Byrds' rapidly shrinking teen audience, but was perfectly in tune with a new underground following who disdained hit singles but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements. David Crosby reflecting on the album during a 1998 interview. Although Younger Than Yesterday was somewhat overlooked by the record buying public at the time of its release, achieving only moderate chart success as a result, its critical stature has grown substantially over the years. In his 2003 book Eight Miles High Folk Rock's Flight from Haight Ashbury to Woodstock, Richie Unterberger states that Younger Than Yesterday was the Byrds' best album besides Mr. Tambourine Man, and more progressive in many ways . The author goes on to say that the album and its follow up are now revered as two of the great 1960s albums by historians and fans , while also acknowledging that at the time, though, the Byrds were considered by many to be waning. Unterberger also praised the album in his review for the AllMusic website, describing it as one of the most durable of the Byrds' albums . Rock critic Robert Christgau, writing for Rolling Stone magazine in 2007, called Younger Than Yesterday the Byrds' first mature album, a blend of space flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism . Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website, calling it a scrumptious smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation , before concluding that in every sense, Younger Than Yesterday is an utterly brilliant album, arguably the Byrds' best. Alan Bisbort, writing in the book Rhino's Psychedelic Trip, described Younger Than Yesterday as an essential snapshot of an incense scented, acid drenched world in motion a kaleidoscope whose every turn yielded some fantastic window on the age . In 2003, the album was ranked at number 124 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. When the list was revised in 2012, to accommodate a number of albums released since 2003, Younger Than Yesterday was repositioned at number 127. It was voted number 197 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition 2000 . Younger Than Yesterday was issued on Compact Disc for the first time by Edsel Records in 1987. It was later reissued by Columbia in the U.S. in 1989 and in the UK in 1993. It was then remastered at 20 bit resolution and reissued with three of its tracks remixed in an expanded form on April 30, 1996, as part of the Columbia Legacy Byrds series. The Columbia Legacy reissue featured six bonus tracks, including Lady Friend and Old John Robertson , which had both been issued on a non album single in July 1967. The remastered CD also included the David Crosby penned track It Happens Each Day , which had been omitted from the original album, and Don't Make Waves , a song that had been written and recorded by the Byrds for the 1967 Alexander Mackendrick film Don't Make Waves. The final track on the Columbia Legacy CD extends to include a hidden track featuring the guitar parts from Mind Gardens , which were heard on the album playing backwards, but are presented here playing forwards, as they were originally recorded. In 2011, the audiophile record label Audio Fidelity released the original mono mix of Younger Than Yesterday on CD for the first time, remastered by audio engineer Steve Hoffman. The mono version of the album was reissued again, along with its stereo counterpart and three bonus tracks, on a single Blu spec CD in Japan in 2012.

"Ross Middlebrook Pep Youngs April 10, 1897 October 22, 1927 was an American professional baseball player. Nicknamed Pep , he played ten seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants from 1917 through 1926, playing right field almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the Giants teams that won four consecutive National League pennants and the 1921 and 1922 World Series. From Shiner, Texas, Youngs excelled at baseball and American football at the West Texas Military Institute. After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball, the Giants signed him in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 batting average with the Giants and batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the age of 30 of Bright's disease. Youngs was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His election was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were leveled against the committee. Youngs was born in Shiner, Texas, the second of three children, all sons. His father was a railroad worker, but suffered disability and moved his family to San Antonio where he worked as a rancher. Youngs' mother ran a small hotel in San Antonio and Youngs had a paper route. Youngs was educated at West Texas Military Institute. He received offers for scholarships to play college football but passed on these, as he preferred baseball. He made his professional baseball debut for the Austin Senators of the Texas League in 1914. Appearing in 17 games, he hit just .145 for the class B Senators and, in 1915, found himself down in the Class D leagues, playing for Brenham of the Middle Texas League and the Waxahachie Athletics of the Central Texas League both leagues disbanded during the season. In 1916, playing in the infield for the Sherman Lions of the Class D Western Association, he hit .362 as a switch hitter, drawing the attention of the New York Giants, who purchased his contract in August for 2,000 46,049 in current dollar terms . Youngs reported to spring training in Marlin, Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, the manager of the Hustlers, I'm giving you one of the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm holding you responsible. In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit .356, earning himself a late season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname Pep due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager. Youngs made his major league debut on September 25 and played in seven of the last nine games of the season for the eventual National League NL pennant winners six in center field and one in right. In those seven games he went 9 for 26 .346 with two doubles and three triples. In 1918, regular Giants right fielder Dave Robertson left the team to manage a local military ballclub, and Youngs was given the full time job out of spring training. Batting exclusively left handed, Youngs responded by batting .302 in 121 games, finishing sixth in the league. It would be the first of seven straight seasons in which he hit .300 as a regular, and the second of eight overall counting his brief stint in 1917. He also finished sixth in the NL with a .368 on base percentage OBP . The next season Robertson was traded to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Phil Douglas, leaving Youngs to become a fixture in right field for the Giants. Youngs finished third in the NL in 1919 with a .311 batting average. His .351 batting average in 1920 was second in the NL to Rogers Hornsby. Youngs batted .327 in 1921, good for ninth in the NL. In Game 3 of the 1921 World Series Youngs became the first player to record two hits in the same inning of a World Series game. The Giants defeated the New York Yankees as Youngs batted .280 in the series. Youngs hit for the cycle on April 29, 1922. He finished the regular season ninth in the NL in OBP .398 and tied for ninth in stolen bases 17 , proceeding to hit .375 in the 1922 World Series as the Giants again defeated the Yankees. Youngs led the NL in runs scored in 1923, with 121, and his .348 batting average was the eighth best in the league. Youngs batted .356 in the 1923 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Yankees. Youngs batted .356 during the 1924 season, finishing third in the NL. In the final series of this season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell, an outfielder for the Giants, offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand 500 to intentionally lose the games 7,310 in current dollar terms . Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Crazy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell implicated teammates Youngs, George Kelly, and Frankie Frisch as co conspirators Landis, however, cleared the trio of any wrongdoing. Youngs slumped to a .185 batting average during the 1924 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Washington Senators. Continuing to struggle in 1925, Youngs batted .264, his only season with a batting average below .300, but improved to .306 in 95 games during the 1926 season. Toward the end of his career, Youngs taught Mel Ott, his eventual successor, how to play right field in the Polo Grounds. Youngs's career was abruptly cut short in 1926, when he was diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection in 1924. Too ill to play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw's insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927. Youngs died of Bright's disease on October 22, 1927, at the age of 30. He went from weighing 170 pounds 77 kg during his playing career to 100 pounds 45 kg by the time of his death. In Youngs' obituary in The New York Times, Giants manager John McGraw called Youngs the greatest outfielder I ever saw on a ball field. The Giants honored Youngs with a bronze plaque on the right field wall of the Polo Grounds although the Giants intended to pay for it, fans expressed their desire to contribute and, even though contributions were limited to 1 per person, donations paid for the plaque entirely. Over his ten year career, Youngs posted 812 runs, 42 home runs, 592 runs batted in RBI , 153 stolen bases, a .322 career batting average, and .399 career on base percentage. He batted .300 or higher in every season until 1925, and higher than .350 twice. Youngs scored 100 or more runs three times and posted a career high 102 RBI in 1921 and 10 home runs in 1924. During his tenure with the team, the Giants went to the World Series four consecutive years 19211924 and won twice 1921, 1922 . Youngs was a favorite of McGraw, who kept only two pictures in his office one of Christy Mathewson and one of Youngs. Rosy Ryan, a teammate with the Giants, and Burleigh Grimes, who played against Youngs as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, considered Youngs the best player they ever saw. Youngs was included in the inaugural balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936, but received less than 5 of the vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America BBWAA . Youngs remained on the ballot every year through 1956, receiving his highest vote total in 1947 with 22 . Ford C. Frick, Commissioner of Baseball, and former teammate Bill Terry both championed Youngs' candidacy. Former Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch joined the Veterans Committee in 1967 and aided the elections of several of their former teammates, including Youngs in 1972. In addition to Youngs, Terry and Frisch shepherded the selections of Giants teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. Youngs died at the earliest age of any current Hall of Famer. Youngs is the only member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame from San Antonio and was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. Shiner, the town in which Youngs was born, hosted a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003. Youngs' selection, along with some of the other selections made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members, and charges of cronyism were later leveled against the committee. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. Baseball statistician Bill James recognized this and wrote that Youngs does not belong in the Hall of Fame. In 1981, however, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Youngs in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. They explained what they called the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome , where a player of truly exceptional talent but a career curtailed by injury or illness should still in spite of not owning career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all time greats be included on their list of the 100 greatest players. Youngs married Dorothy Pienecke, a woman from Brooklyn who he met while vacationing in the Berkshires, in October 1924. Their daughter Caroline was born in December 1925. Dorothy feuded with Youngs' mother, however, and the couple separated before the birth of Caroline, whom he never met. Youngs was considered friendly and generous, loaned money constantly, and was reportedly owed 16,000 at the time of his death 230,774 in current dollar terms . Youngs enjoyed playing golf and was considered the best golfer in the major leagues.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross%20Youngs
"Henry S. Yount March 18, 1839 May 16, 1924 was an American Civil War soldier, mountain man, professional hunter and trapper, prospector, wilderness guide and packer, seasonal employee of the United States Department of the Interior, and the first game warden in Yellowstone National Park. He was nicknamed Rocky Mountain Harry Yount . Yount served two terms in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He first enlisted for a six month term in November 1861. He was wounded and taken prisoner by the Confederate States Army in an opening skirmish of the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas in March 1862, and held as a prisoner of war for nearly a month until released in a prisoner exchange. He re enlisted in August 1862 and served until the end of the war. He was promoted three times and was a company quartermaster sergeant when he was discharged in July 1865. He worked as a hunter and a prospector, and as a bullwhacker for the U.S. Army, in the years following the Civil War. For seven years in the 1870s he worked as a guide, hunter and wrangler for the expeditions of the Hayden Geological Surveys, which mapped vast areas of the Rocky Mountains. In 1880, Yount was hired by the United States Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, to be the first gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park, and during his 14 months in that job wrote two annual reports for Schurz, which were then submitted to Congress. His reports described the challenges of protecting the wildlife in the first U.S. national park and influenced the culture of the National Park Service, which was founded 35 years later in 1916. Horace Albright, the second director of the National Park Service, called Yount the father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger . Yount was a prospector during much of the last four decades of his life. Harry Yount's paternal ancestors, Hans George Jundt and Anna Marie Jundt, arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, immigrants from Alsace Lorraine. One of their sons, Andrew Yount, followed in 1751, and later moved to Randolph County, North Carolina. Andrew was a Quaker, as were his children, including John Yount, Harry's paternal grandfather. Harry's parents were David Yount 17951881 and Catherine Shell Yount. With a number of other Quaker family members, they emigrated from North Carolina to Missouri in the 1830s. Harry Yount's father, David Yount, was about 44 years old at the time of Harry's birth, and Harry was the couple's tenth child. Harry Yount's uncle, George C. Yount, was a trapper and explorer who moved on from Missouri to Santa Fe and then to California before Harry's birth. In the 1830s, George C. Yount became the first citizen of the United States to settle in Napa Valley in California, which was then Mexican territory. The town of Yountville, California, is named after him. Two of Harry's older brothers, Caleb and John Yount, also moved to the Napa Valley years later. There are conflicting accounts of Harry Yount's place and date of birth. Ernest Ingersoll wrote that he was born in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and different birth years have been mentioned by various writers, such as the anonymous author of a published biographical sketch who wrote that Yount was born in 1847, and Thomas J. Bryant, who interviewed Yount in the latter years of his life and who speculated that 1837 was his birth date in an article published in the Annals of Wyoming, journal of the Wyoming State Historical Society. However, research undertaken by William R. Supernaugh, an employee of the National Park Service, found military enlistment papers, Yount's Army pension file, and the 1840 United States Census records, all of which indicate that Yount was born on March 18, 1839. These records also show that his legal name was Henry S. Yount. His lifelong nickname was Harry , and his middle name is unknown. Although Yount's place of birth is uncertain, Supernaugh concludes it is highly unlikely he was born in Pennsylvania, but rather in Harmony Township, Washington County, Missouri, because the 1840 census shows his father living there with a baby son. Henry was listed as 11 years old in the 1850 census. Harmony Township is a rural area about 75 miles 121 kilometres southwest of St. Louis. Yount enlisted in the Union Army for a six month term on November 9, 1861, and served in Company F of Phelps' Regiment of the Missouri Infantry. John W. Phelps, his commanding general, was an ardent abolitionist. Yount was wounded in the leg in a skirmish just before the Battle of Pea Ridge began on March 6, 1862, and taken prisoner by the Confederates. As a captive, he was marched more than 90 miles 140 km to Fort Smith in his bare feet on cold, wet roads, and was held there as a POW for 28 days before his release in a prisoner exchange. He was discharged from the Union Army in May 1862. Yount re enlisted in Lebanon, Missouri, on August 9, 1862, and served as a private in Company H of the 8th Regiment Missouri Volunteer Cavalry, a unit involved in 11 combat engagements during his service. On April 14, 1863, he was promoted to corporal and then to sergeant on December 9, 1863 he became company quartermaster sergeant on June 13, 1864. He was discharged in Little Rock, Arkansas, on July 20, 1865, after the war had ended. As a result of his barefoot march to captivity, Yount developed rheumatism in both feet. When the Dependent and Disability Pension Act passed in 1890, he became eligible for a monthly partial disability pension of 6 in 1892, which was raised to 12 a month in 1900 and 25 in 1912. Yount was later an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic, the post war organization of veterans of the Union Army. After the Civil War ended, Yount became engaged to Estella Braun, a Western Union employee in Detroit, Michigan. She was killed in a train wreck before their wedding could take place, and he never married. Yount traveled to Fort Kearny, along the Oregon Trail in Nebraska. There he was hired as an Army bullwhacker, transporting supplies by wagon along the Bozeman Trail between Fort Laramie in modern day Wyoming and Fort C. F. Smith in modern day Montana. There was conflict with Native Americans in this region in those years, and Yount fought against Cheyenne and Sioux warriors several times while on the trail. In one incident, his ox wagon was harassed for four days by a party of Sioux warriors, until he fired his carbine at one warrior, hitting and probably killing the warrior's horse. Supernaugh comments that Yount believed that Indians would kill him if they could, but that he did not blame the Indians for defending what was their country originally. Yount also worked as a buffalo hunter during this period. He sold buffalo tongues for 1 each to tourists in Cheyenne. Yount believed that it was a pity to kill off the buffaloes, which were here in immense numbers, but it was the only way to get rid of the Indians, as the buffalo were their main source of subsistence. The Smithsonian Institution engaged Yount's services to collect specimens of animals for taxidermy display in the early 1870s. Because he was successful in this first assignment, Spencer F. Baird of the Smithsonian again retained Yount's services in 1875 to collect specimens of many species of Rocky Mountain mammals. It is likely that many of these were displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, as extant photos of the exhibit halls show similar specimens. During those years, Yount also began his long career as prospector, achieving some success. In 1877, Yount was the subject of a magazine profile written by Ernest Ingersoll and published in Appleton's Journal in New York. Ingersoll described Yount's expertise as a hunter, including a story that he once killed 70 antelope in one day during a competition with another hunter, but that Yount was ashamed of the accomplishment because it went against his heart to kill so many innocent creatures just for the glory. Yount would fill a wagon full of freshly killed game, and then sell the meat in towns such as Laramie and Cheyenne. According to Ingersoll, Yount was quite careful about his personal appearance his belt, holster, knife sheath, bridle, and saddle are all set off with a barbaric glitter. Yount paid a Shoshone woman to decorate his buckskin jacket, a marvel of fringes, fur trimming and intricate embroidery of beads. Ingersoll wrote that Yount was by nature a gentleman, and under his sinewy frame and tireless strength, there is a heart as tender as a girl's, which hates the cruelty his profession unavoidably occasions. His eye is open to every beautiful feature of the grand world in which he lives his heart is alive to all the gentle influences of the original wilderness. Ingersoll's 1883 book, Knocking 'Round the Rockies, describes Yount in a similar fashion. In 1872 or 1873, Yount was hired as a seasonal guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad swaths of the Rocky Mountains. The Hayden Survey, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and funded by the Department of the Interior, was one of several regional survey projects that were combined to form the United States Geological Survey in 1879. Hayden had been one of the leading advocates for the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872. Yount worked for Hayden's expeditions each summer for seven years during the 1870s, in what are now the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. Each winter during the period, Yount would hunt and trap in the Laramie Range in Wyoming. In 1874, Yount was assigned to hunt for a party led by the geologist Archibald Marvine. Yount was later charged by a huge grizzly bear, and fired four gunshots one through the skull, two through the flanks, and a final shot into the heart before the bear was brought down. During Hayden's expedition of 1877, Yount engaged in mountaineering with Ingersoll and the cartographer A. D. Wilson in the Wind River Range. They were the first to ascend the south slopes of Wind River Peak, and, with Wilson, Yount was the first to ascend West Atlantic Peak. Hayden's expedition of 1878 conducted surveys in Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1878. That expedition included the British mountaineer James Eccles and Eccles's favorite Swiss mountain guide, Michel Payot of Chamonix. Eccles wanted to attempt an ascent of the Grand Teton, then unclimbed. This was the third attempt to climb the Grand Teton by members of Hayden's expeditions. Yount served as the guide in a four man party that included Eccles, Payot and Wilson. Eccles and Payot were held up by the disappearance of two mules carrying their gear, and so were unable to accompany Wilson and Yount on to the higher parts of the mountain. During the climb, Yount slipped on the ice and fell close to a deep chasm in the glacier, where water was streaming down from the cliff above. The hold of his buckskin pants on the ice reportedly prevented him from being carried down into the crevice. Wilson was quoted as saying that Yount was clinging to the rock like a starfish hanging to a breakwater, and that he himself lowered a rope to assist Yount. Because of the delay and the absence of the experienced Alpine climbers, Yount and Wilson had to turn back a few hundred feet short of the summit, at a spur called The Enclosure. No previous party had come so close to reaching the summit. The undisputed first ascent of the Grand Teton took place 20 years later, in 1898. Yount was hired as the first gamekeeper for Yellowstone National Park in 1880, at a salary of 1,000 per year, when the park's entire budget was just 15,000 per year. He was appointed by Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior and a former Union Army general, on June 21, 1880, and reported for duty at Yellowstone on July 6. His supervisor was Philetus Norris, the second park superintendent. Shortly after Yount reported for duty, Yount escorted Schurz and his party on a tour of the park, and then conducted a survey of the park's wildlife. Yount began constructing a winter camp at the junction of the East Fork of the Yellowstone River and Soda Butte Valley, a location he chose because it allowed for the protection of herds of buffalo and elk against poachers. Yount submitted his first Report of Gamekeeper on November 25, 1880, which was included as Appendix A to the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. His report described his activities since being hired. He recommended The appointment of a small, active, reliable police force, to receive regular pay during the spring and summer at least, when animals are likely to be slaughtered by tourists and mountaineers. It is evident that such a force could, in addition to the protection of game, assist the superintendent of the Park in enforcing the laws, rules and regulations for protection of guide boards and bridges, and the preservation of the countless and widely scattered geyser cones and other matchless wonders of the Park. In his report of September 30, 1881, Yount described how he spent the unusually severe winter of 18801881, and his efforts to prevent poaching by tourists and Indians, while still hunting to provide food for the park staff. Yount reported that snow had fallen on 66 of 90 days between December 1880 and February 1881. He described the range and habits of Yellowstone's large mammals and expressed regret for the unfortunate breakage of my thermometer when it could not be replaced, along with a submitted synopsis of the weather the previous winter. In this report, he resigned his position to resume private enterprises now requiring my personal attention, and concluded with a clear recommendation I do not think that any one man appointed by the honorable Secretary, and specifically designated as a gamekeeper, is what is needed or can prove effective for certain necessary purposes, but a small and reliable police force of men, employed when needed, during good behavior, and dischargeable for cause by the superintendent of the park, is what is really the most practicable way of seeing that the game is protected from wanton slaughter, the forests from careless use of fire, and the enforcement of all the other laws, rules, and regulations for the protection and improvement of the park. There are indications that Yount had a difference of opinion with park superintendent Norris, who wanted him to spend more of his time building roads for the convenience of tourists, while Yount preferred to concentrate on protecting the wildlife. Although Yount's official job title was gamekeeper rather than park ranger , and although he only worked in Yellowstone National Park for 14 months, his two annual reports had a lasting impact on the administration of the national parks in the United States. He is securely positioned in the legend and culture of the National Park Service, and is considered a figure of historic proportion . In Oh, Ranger , a book published in 1928, Horace Albright, who later became the second director of the National Park Service, wrote that Harry Yount pointed out in a report that it was impossible for one man to patrol the park. He urged the formation of a ranger force. So Harry Yount is credited with being the father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger. Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, wrote the foreword of the book. After Yount resigned from his job in Yellowstone, he lived for a while in Uva, Wyoming. He homesteaded in the area in 1887 but his claim was sold in a sheriff's sale in 1892. He spent nearly 40 years prospecting in the Laramie Mountains, and developed copper and graphite mining claims. He settled in Wheatland, Wyoming, and worked on developing a marble mining claim west of there. Yount was actively involved in prospecting until the day before his death, when he had been looking for a ride to inspect a possible gold deposit. On May 16, 1924, he walked into downtown Wheatland, as was his daily habit, where he collapsed and died of heart failure near a Lutheran church. He was buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne. Younts Peak, which is 12,156 feet 3,705 metres high and located in the Absaroka Range at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, is named after Yount. The peak's name was bestowed by the Hayden Geological Survey. Long after his death, in the 1970s, Yount's marble mining claim finally went into production. It yielded crushed marble for use in landscaping and aquariums. In 1994, the National Park Service established the Harry Yount Award, given annually to an employee whose overall impact, record of accomplishments, and excellence in traditional ranger duties have created an appreciation for the park ranger profession. This award is given both nationally and regionally. According to Supernaugh, Yount is credited with setting the standards for performance and service by which the public has come to judge the rangers of today .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%20Yount

"Your Body is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera from her seventh studio album, Lotus 2012 . It was written by Savan Kotecha, Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, while its production was done by Martin and Shellback. RCA Records premiered the song on September 14, 2012 on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, and later sent it to US contemporary hit and rhythmic radio stations two days later as the lead single from Lotus. Your Body is a dance, electropop and R B number with elements from dubstep and Eurodance. Its lyrics express Aguilera's desire to have sex with an anonymous partner. Your Body received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, some of them praised Aguilera's vocals while the others criticized its lyrical theme and the synthesizers used in the track.

Internationally, the song peaked at number 10 on the Canadian Hot 100 and charted within the top forty charts of several countries, including Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for Your Body was released on September 28, 2012.

As of June 2018, the single has sold 570,000 digital copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan In December 2011, it was announced that Aguilera was teaming up with Swedish hit producer Max Martin on her comeback single for her then upcoming album. On July 3, 2012, Billboard reported that the club banger would be officially produced by Martin. Writing for the same publication, Andrew Hampp thought that their collaboration was very surprising because Martin had been working with a lot of artists, including the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears however, Your Body was the first song Martin wrote for Aguilera, as Aguilera had previously wanted to differentiate herself from the aforementioned acts. During an interview with the magazine, she commented on the Swedish producer, saying Max is legendary in the business. He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths... It's taken us a decade in the same business and watching each other from a distance, so for us to now come together and respect each other's work ethic and how we like to be heard and making a marriage out of it, I think Your Body is the best culmination of that . Prior to its official release, an uncensored demo version of Your Body was leaked to the web on August 23, 2012, entitled Fuck Your Body , where she sings All I wanna do is fuck your body in the chorus. On September 12, 2012, Aguilera revealed details about Lotus and Your Body via Twitter, including the cover artwork. RCA Records premiered the song on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on September 14, 2012.

It also features Aguilera's all curves TJ from Neon Limelight called the cover sizzling and wrote that it features her bodacious curves on full display . Rebecca Macatee of E Online labelled the artwork an R rated recreation of Genie in a Bottle . MTV Buzzworthy's Byron Flitsch praised the cover, calling it a stunning cover art that has rendered us totally speechless . Fuse's Nicole James and Andrew Stout from SF Weekly compared Aguilera's image on the artwork to that of Marilyn Monroe in the photo shoot The Last Sitting. Your Body is a midtempo dance, electropop and R B number, with dubstep and Eurodance influences. The song features heavy synthesizers, stuttering drums, and hard hitting beats. According to Gregory Hicks from The Michigan Daily, Your Body is musically similar to Jessie J's 2011 song Abracadabra . Chris Martins from Spin commented that the song has a mellow thrust that hits muted transcendence for the chorus before dipping back down into that bummer bump . The chorus and the bridge features Aguilera's powerful vocals, provided by heavy synthesizers over a booming Eurodance beat. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Melissa Maerz noted that Aguilera's vocals are provided by too much synthesizers. Gregory Hicks of The Michigan Daily compared her synthesized voice on the song to those in Maroon 5's One More Night , which was also produced by Martin. In Your Body , Aguilera sings of having a one night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she angrily purrs, So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked . Synthesizers and stuttering drums are featured at the pre chorus, Don't even tell me your name All I need to know is whose place And let's get walking . Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love At the second verse, she tells her lover, I am a freak, I'm disturbed So come on and give me your worst We're moving faster than slow If you don't know where to go I'll finish off on my own . The four on the floor refrain has Aguilera flaunting her famous pipes on the chorus, All I wanna do is love your body Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it . In a track by track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song doesn't peak until Aguilera growls , I think you already know my name at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of Your Body are similar to Aguilera's previous single Dirrty 2002 . Your Body garnered mixed to positive reviews from music critics. In a positive feedback, a reviewer from Billboard wrote that it's clear the diva is going for broke . Writing for Digital Spy, Robert Cospey scored the single a four stars out of five rating and labelled it one of Aguilera's best tracks. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times picked the song as one of the stand out songs from Lotus that highlighted Aguilera's volcanic vocals, naming it sweaty and bold . Mikeal Wood from the Los Angeles Times praised Your Body 's musical diversity from her previous 2010 record Bionic and complimented Aguilera's powerhouse vocals on the track. Sarah Deen for Metro praised the single as a funky, thumping dance number that is one for the girls to dance around their handbags to . Writing for The Guardian, Issy Sampson praised the song for being everything you want from loud yelling, lyrics about crap one night stands and a slutty video. Alexis L. Loinaz from E Online also provided a positive review, stating that the song promises to be a major dance floor stomper, laying on the synths atop a thumping bass line as the power belter's potent vocals pile on the decibels . In a mixed review, Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly praised Aguilera's vocals, which reaches high enough to dust the angels with bronzer . However, Maerz criticized the overused synthesizers in the track, commenting that she could be anyone . Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen wrote You can measure a singer's place in the pop star pecking order by the quality of the Max Martin Shellback song she releases. For Xtina, the news ain't good. Gregory Hicks for The Michigan Daily criticized that the song's lyrics aren't even worth a discussion he also criticized the synthesizers used in the song and commented that even Aguilera's flop Bionic had more musical complexity . Your Body debuted and peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issue dated October 6, 2012 with 103,000 digital copies sold. The song debuted at number ten on the Hot Digital Songs, becoming Aguilera's first top ten song on the chart as the lead artist since Keeps Gettin' Better peaked at number 5 in 2008.

A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, Once we started talking with each other and she heard 'Your Body,' she spun it in a way that you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self assured, but she's super playful and super tongue in cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously. The video starts with a warning saying no men were harmed in the making of this video . In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's computer games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks Hey Oranum, what's my week look like to which the occult fortune teller responds You're gonna have a killer week . Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, showering the room in a mist of red confetti . The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at her reflection and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on The Lucy Show before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball. The video received positive reviews from media outlets. James Montgomery from MTV News commented that the video is grisly and garish, but also incredibly clever and visually arresting . T. Kyle writing for MTV Buzzworthy gave the video a positive feedback, writing Christina manages to be fun and provocative, the styling is beautiful and even aspirational, and Legendtina's body looks amazing . Sam Lansky from Idolator website complimented Aguilera's charming sense of humor and deemed Your Body as one of Aguilera's best music videos.

In a review of the video for Yahoo Music, Lyndsey Park complimented the cultural references in the video, writing that it's enough to make even Seth MacFarlane or Dennis Miller's heads spin. And yet, somehow, it's all so very, very Xtina . Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that It might take us a few more viewings to get the joke, but at least there's enough amazing absurdity going on to make that prospect sound entertaining . On December 4, 2012, Fuse announced that Your Body was the number one video of 2012, based on online voting. On November 2, 2012, Aguilera performed Your Body on the Late Night with Jimmy Fallon with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, using office supplies as instruments including an iPhone and a stapler.

"Your Cheatin' Heart is a song written and recorded by country music singer songwriter Hank Williams in 1952, regarded as one of country's most important standards. Country music historian Colin Escott writes that the song for all intents and purposes defines country music. He was inspired to write the song while driving with his fiancee from Nashville, Tennessee to Shreveport, Louisiana. After describing his first wife Audrey Sheppard as a Cheatin' Heart , he dictated in minutes the lyrics to Billie Jean Jones. Produced by Fred Rose, Williams recorded the song on his last session at Castle Records in Nashville, Tennessee, on September 23. Your Cheatin' Heart was released in January 1953. Propelled by Williams' recent death during a trip to a New Year's concert in Canton, Ohio, the song became an instant success. It topped Billboard's Country Western chart for six weeks, while over a million units were sold. The success of the song continued. Joni James' version reached number two on Billboard's Most Played in Jukeboxes the same year, while Ray Charles' 1962 version reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 13 on the UK Singles Chart. The song ranked at 213 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and was ranked number 5 on Country Music Television's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music. By 1952, Williams was enjoying a successful streak, releasing multiple hits, including Honky Tonk Blues , Half as Much , Settin' the Woods on Fire , Jambalaya On the Bayou and You Win Again . While his career was soaring, his marriage to Audrey Sheppard became turbulent. He developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine and painkillers prescribed to ease his severe back pain caused by spina bifida. The couple divorced on May 29, and Williams moved in with his mother. Soon after, Williams met Billie Jean Jones backstage at the Ryman Auditorium, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana, who was, at the time, dating Faron Young. Williams started dating Jones, upon the end of her relationship with Young and soon began to plan their marriage. While driving from Nashville, Tennessee to Shreveport to announce the wedding to her parents, Williams talked to her about his previous marriage and described Audrey Sheppard as a cheatin' heart , adding that one day she would have to pay . Inspired by his line, he instructed Jones to take his notebook and write down the lyrics of the song that he quickly dictated to her. The finished composition included the line You'll walk the floor, the way I do , which evoked Ernest Tubb's hit Walking the Floor Over You . Williams recorded the song on September 23 at the Castle Studios in Nashville. The session, which became Williams' last, also produced the A side Kaw Liga , as well as the songs I Could Never Be Ashamed of You and Take These Chains from My Heart . It was produced by Williams' publisher Fred Rose, who made minor arrangements of the lyrics of Your Cheatin' Heart . Williams described the song to his friend, Braxton Schuffert, as he was about to play it, as the best heart song he ever wrote . Williams is backed on the session by Tommy Jackson fiddle , Don Helms steel guitar , Chet Atkins lead guitar , Jack Shook rhythm guitar , and Floyd Lightnin' Chance bass . While traveling to a scheduled New Year's show in Canton, Ohio, the driver found Williams dead on the backseat of the car during a stop in Oak Hill, West Virginia. Your Cheatin' Heart was released at the end of January 1953. Propelled by Williams' death, the song and the A side Kaw Liga became a hit, selling over a million records. Billboard initially described the songs as superlative tunes and performances , emphasizing the sales potential. Within a short time from its release, the song reached number one on Billboard's Top C W Records, where it remained for six weeks. A demo version of Williams singing Your Cheatin' Heart with just his guitar, likely recorded in 1951, is also available. Released in the wake of his passing, the song became synonymous with the myth of Hank Williams as a haunted, lonely figure who expressed pain with an authenticity that became the standard for country music. The name of the song was used as the title of Hank Williams' 1964 biopic. Your Cheatin' Heart , as well as other songs by Williams were performed on the movie, with George Hamilton dubbing the soundtrack album recorded by Williams' son, Hank Williams, Jr. In the 2003 documentary series Lost Highway, country music historian Ronnie Pugh comments, It's Hank's anthem, it's his musical last will and testament. It's searing, it's powerful, it's gripping. If you want to say this is his last and best work, I wouldn't argue with that. AllMusic described the track as the signature song of Hank Williams, and an unofficial anthem of country music. Rolling Stone called it one of the greatest country standards of all time , ranking it at number 217 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song ranked at number 5 in Country Music Television's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003, Two Pepsi Super Bowl commercials featured the song, one aired during Super Bowl XXX, featured Williams' recording while a Coca Cola deliveryman grabbed a Pepsi. The second one, aired during Super Bowl XLVI, featured the same situation, but with the song covered by Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland. The song forms the title of the 1990 TV drama 'Your Cheatin' Heart' by John Byrne.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your%20Cheatin%27%20Heart

We demand another helping. Robbie Daw of Idolator gave the song a positive review, while complimented Minaj's dual rapping and singing, as well as the use of the sample. Backy Bain also of Idolator additionally gave the song a positive review stating We were a bit worried that Harujuku Barbie would forever be the garnish on other peoples tracks instead of the main dish, but this sweet song proves otherwise.

Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride . His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, It's a lot harder than you'd think to make something seem this effortless.

Yours Truly is the result of three years of work. The project underwent significant conceptual and sonic changes throughout that time. Grande began working on the album in August 2010 while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to thirteen. The first single, a bubblegum pop song called Put Your Hearts Up , was released on December 12, 2011. The single was aimed at young audiences, perhaps intending to cater to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up by kids who knew her from Victorious. During an interview in June 2012, Grande described everything on the album as being 50s, 60s doo wop inspired and revealed that two new singles were going to be released before the album, one of which was called Do You Love Me and featured SkyBlu. Other songs that Grande had rights to, named and later leaked as being part of the album included Honeymoon Avenue , Voodoo Love , Pink Champagne , Boyfriend Material , Tattooed Heart , Daydreamin' and You're My Only Shawty . The latter never made it onto Yours Truly and was eventually given to Demi Lovato to record and include on her 2011 R B infused album Unbroken as You're My Only Shorty . In 2013, Grande met up with her label and expressed dissatisfaction with the direction the album was taking. In several interviews during 2013, she admitted to having completely disliked her debut single, Put Your Hearts Up , and not having an interest in pursuing music of that genre. She expressed a desire to make the type of music she grew up listening to, which was, urban pop, 90s music. Rapper Iggy Azalea turned down working on the album she however did collaborate with Grande on her second album My Everything. The album was originally titled Daydreamin and set to be released during August 2013. The album is inspired by a variety of different artists, ranging from Amy Winehouse and Christina Aguilera to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Grande describes the album's first half is a throwback to the R B music of the 1990s, and the second half is she describes as something that is very unique and very special that I've sort of written which is completely original. In summation of the record she stated So half of it is a throwback and like very familiar feeling, feel good, and then half of it is something that I've created that's sort of special and unique and refreshing and wonderful and I love it . In terms of music, Yours Truly explores a retro style sound mixing 1990s pop and R B, with certain songs incorporating influences from mid '90s hip hop, '50s piano pop, and doo wop. Scott Interrante from PopMatters complimented the music presented in the album and noted that compositionally and production wise, tropes of both styles are blended together effortlessly. As he perceived, erratic programmed drums support the rich harmonies and piano chords of the more doo wop songs and the R B tracks are infused with a wide eyed optimism more associated with the 60s pop style. Pitchfork's Andrew Ryce felt that Grande opted for a 90s hip hop soul vibe that awkwardly sits with the more doo wop indebted songwriting. The album opens with an orchestral intro that introduces the first track Honeymoon Avenue , a downtempo song composed in the key of F sharp major and set in a 44 time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo wop with an urban inspired sound. Lyrically, Honeymoon Avenue uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her romantic partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode that may make them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that Honeymoon Avenue is about knowing you are at the end of a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over. The second track Baby I is drenched in a retro sound from 1990s R B and pop sonority. Lyrically, Baby I is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of Baby I are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums. The third track Right There features guest appearance by rapper Big Sean. Musically, Right There also incorporates the influences frein 1990s R B and urban music, mixing stabbing synths , trap inflected beat and a hip hop groove. Reviewing the song, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that while Big Sean boasts about his sexual prowess, Grande flaunts her typically impressive melismas before ratcheting up the emotion for the finale. The fourth track Tattooed Heart is a doo wop song written in the key of G major with a tempo of 72 beats per minute in compound quadruple 128 time while Grande's vocals spans from D4 to F5. Piano is built on a hand clapped rhythm, pulsating beats and a piano loop. To promote her debut single The Way , Grande visited various radio stations, including Y 100 Miami, 93.3 FM, Z100, KIIS FM, and 997 Now.

At AllMusic, Matt Collar rated the album four stars out of five, saying that Yours Truly was surprisingly sophisticated and unique which showcases Grande's soulful R B vocals. He stated that the album often brings to mind the intonations of Mariah Carey which are most likely intentional. Collar closed the statement saying that Yours Truly makes the most of her talent. Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly graded the album an A , calling the album pure pop bliss and one of the most purely enjoyable albums of the year that is powered by her lithe, Broadway honed voice . At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica gave a positive review of the album, writing that television shows such as American Idol and Glee have been responsible for an intense surge of interest in music on television, but they haven't left much of a mark on the shape of pop. That's because both shows are fundamentally conservative institutions, privileging the familiar and the unchallenging. They're about emulating, not innovating. Caramanica commended Grande for becoming the first identifiable pop star who takes the rules of those enterprises, uses them as a foundation, and innovates atop them... She uses the Glee Idol template as a jumping off point to make modern pop R B with a sturdy vintage backbone. Writing in his track by track review Jason Lipshutz from Billboard rated the album an eighty six out of 100, saying that Yours Truly carries the expectations of a young singer who has already proven herself on the pop charts, and even if the songs on her debut could not equal the quality of The Way, Grande had the fan base and powerful pipes to survive a misfire. At PopMatters, Scott Interrante rated the album eight discs out of ten, writing that Minor missteps aside, Yours Truly is ultimately an impressive debut for Grande. Ryan Dennehy of AbsolutePunk rated the album a 70 percent, stating that Yours Truly is more tempered and less likely to put you in a beaming state of catatonia that is a missive containing some of her most personal thoughts and her oft regrettable youthful impulses. At Pitchfork, Andrew Ryce rated the album a 6.5 out of ten, calling it a very safe record. Lewis Conner of Digital Spy rated the album four stars out of five, writing how The production feels fresh, the lyrics are relatable and the melodies are as cool and sweet as a dollop of raspberry ripple , and where he also states that The tone and pace of the album rarely changes, but the songs feel accomplished, polished and vibrant . Corner concluded by calling Yours Truly a little less than a triumph. At The Michigan Daily, Gregory Hicks graded the album a B, saying most tracks are of quality composition, lyrically and melodically, but beat usage becomes excessive at times. Jim Farber of The New York Daily News rated the album three stars out of five, stating that because the armies of song doctors that the release is far more tuneful than Mariah's interchangeable hits. On September 4, 2013, Billboard reported that Yours Truly would most likely sell between 110,000 and 120,000 copies in its first week in the United States by the end of September 11, 2013.

"Malala Yousafzai Urdu Pashto born 12 July 1997 , also known mononymously as Malala, is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she has become the most prominent citizen of the country. Yousafzai was born to a Pashtun family in Mingora, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was particularly inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 1112, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during the Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu. On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the Swat District, after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism the gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become the most famous teenager in the world . Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of fifty leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwa against those who tried to kill her. The Taliban was internationally denounced by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. Taliban officials responded to condemnation by further denouncing Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt, which was justified as a religious obligation. Their statements resulted in further international condemnation. Following her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she founded the Malala Fund, a non profit organisation, and in 2013 co authored I Am Malala, an international best seller. In 2012, she was the recipient of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize. In 2014, she was the co recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, Yousafzai was a subject of the Oscar shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017, she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada. Yousafzai attended Edgbaston High School from 2013 to 2017, and is currently studying for a bachelor's degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower middle class family. She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Tor Pekai Yousafzai. Her family is Sunni Muslim of Pashtun ethnicity. The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and as a result, Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours. She was given her first name Malala meaning grief stricken after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan. Her last name, Yousafzai, is that of a large Pashtun tribal confederation that is predominant in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where she grew up. At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Toor Pekai, and two pet chickens. Fluent in Pashto, Urdu and English, Yousafzai was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, who is a poet, school owner, and an educational activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. In an interview, Yousafzai once stated that she aspired to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed. Inspired by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to Peshawar to speak at the local press club. How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education Yousafzai asked her audience in a speech covered by newspapers and television channels throughout the region. In 2009, Yousafzai began as a trainee and then a peer educator in the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's Open Minds Pakistan youth programme, which worked in schools in the region to help young people engage in constructive discussion on social issues through the tools of journalism, public debate and dialogue. In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu website and his colleagues came up with a novel way of covering the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11 year old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed. Malala Yousafzai, 3 January 2009 BBC blog entry We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban , said Mirza Waheed, the former editor of BBC Urdu. Because they were concerned about Yousafzai's safety, BBC editors insisted that she use a pseudonym. Her blog was published under the byline Gul Makai cornflower in Urdu , a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale. On 3 January 2009, Yousafzai's first entry was posted to the BBC Urdu blog. She would hand write notes and then pass them on to a reporter who would scan and e mail them. The blog records Yousafzai's thoughts during the First Battle of Swat, as military operations take place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shuts down. In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no girls could attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown up more than a hundred girls' schools. The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of artillery fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper. Following the edict, the Taliban destroyed several more local schools. On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Taliban allow girls to go to school. We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying. Malala Yousafzai, 24 January 2009 BBC blog entry In February 2009, girls' schools were still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys had decided not to open until 9 February, and notices appeared saying so. On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an eerie silence . We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed , she wrote in her blog. Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen. After boys' schools reopened, the Taliban lifted restrictions on girls' primary education, where there was co education. Girls only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled. On 15 February, gunshots could be heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying Don't be scared this is firing for peace. Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their FM Radio studio, another round of stronger firing started outside. Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban on the national current affairs show Capital Talk on 18 February. Three days later, local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlulla announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear burqas. On 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before . Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted. Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting. On 9 March, Yousafzai wrote about a science paper that she performed well on, and added that the Taliban were no longer searching vehicles as they once did. Her blog ended on 12 March 2009. After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B. Ellick about filming a documentary. In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. I'm really bored because I have no books to read, Yousafzai is filmed saying in the documentary. That month, after criticising militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Taliban commander. Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father. That summer, for the first time, she committed to becoming a politician and not a doctor, as she had once aspired to be. Malala Yousafzai, Class Dismissed documentary By early July, refugee camps were filled to capacity. The prime minister made a long awaited announcement saying that it was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, Respected ambassador, if you can help us in our education, so please help us. When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage. Following the documentary, Yousafzai was interviewed on the national Pashto language station AVT Khyber, the Urdu language Daily Aaj, and Canada's Toronto Star. She made a second appearance on Capital Talk on 19 August 2009. Her BBC blogging identity was being revealed in articles by December 2009. She also began appearing on television to publicly advocate for female education. From 2009 to 2010 she was the chair of the District Child Assembly of the Khpal Kor Foundation through 2009 and 2010. In 2011 Yousafzai trained with local girls' empowerment organisation, Aware Girls, run by Gulalai Ismail whose training includes advice on women's rights and empowerment to peacefully oppose radicalisation through education. In October 2011, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a South African activist, nominated Yousafzai for the International Children's Peace Prize of the Dutch international children's advocacy group KidsRights Foundation. She was the first Pakistani girl to be nominated for the award. The announcement said, Malala dared to stand up for herself and other girls and used national and international media to let the world know girls should also have the right to go to school. The award was won by Michaela Mycroft of South Africa. Her public profile rose even further when she was awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December. On 19 December 2011, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani awarded her the National Peace Award for Youth. At the proceedings in her honour, Yousafzai stated that she was not a member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education. The prime minister directed the authorities to set up an IT campus in the Swat Degree College for Women at Yousafzai's request, and a secondary school was renamed in her honour. By 2012, Yousafzai was planning to organise the Malala Education Foundation, which would help poor girls go to school. As Yousafzai became more recognised, the dangers facing her increased. Death threats against her were published in newspapers and slipped under her door. On Facebook, where she was an active user, she began to receive threats. Eventually, a Taliban spokesman said they were forced to act. In a meeting held in the summer of 2012, Taliban leaders unanimously agreed to kill her. Malala Yousafzai envisioning a confrontation with the Taliban On 9 October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Yousafzai as she rode home on a bus after taking an exam in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Yousafzai was 15 years old at the time. According to reports, a masked gunman shouted Which one of you is Malala Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all. Upon being identified, Yousafzai was shot with one bullet, which travelled 18 inches from the side of her left eye, through her neck and landed in her shoulder. Two other girls were also wounded in the shooting Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, both of whom were stable enough following the shooting, to speak to reporters and provide details of the attack. After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a military hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of her skull was removed to allow room for swelling. On 11 October 2012, a panel of Pakistani and British doctors decided to move Yousafzai to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, said that she had a 70 chance of survival. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, where she could receive the best medical treatment, as soon as she was stable enough to travel. A team of doctors would travel with her, and the government would bear the cost of her treatment. Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs. Offers to treat Yousafzai came from around the world. On 15 October, Yousafzai travelled to the United Kingdom for further treatment, approved by both her doctors and family. Her plane landed in Birmingham, England where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, one of the specialties of this hospital being the treatment of military personnel injured in conflict. According to media reports at the time, the UK Government stated that he Pakistani government is paying all transport, migration, medical, accommodation and subsistence costs for Malala and her party. Yousafzai had come out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was responding well to treatment, and was said to have a good chance of fully recovering without any brain damage. Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed sitting up in bed. On 11 November, Yousafzai underwent surgery for eight and a half hours, in order to repair her facial nerve. On 3 January 2013, Yousafzai was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in the West Midlands, where she had weekly physiotherapy. She underwent a five hour long operation on 2 February to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing with a cochlear implant, after which she was reported to be in stable condition. Yousafzai wrote in July 2014 that her facial nerve had recovered up to 96 . The murder attempt received worldwide media coverage and produced an outpouring of sympathy and anger. Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities the day after the attack, and over 2 million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan. Pakistani officials offered a 10 million rupee US 105,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said We wouldn't leave our country if my daughter survives or not. We have an ideology that advocates peace. The Taliban cannot stop all independent voices through the force of bullets. Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari described the shooting as an attack on civilized people . UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon called it a heinous and cowardly act . United States President Barack Obama found the attack reprehensible, disgusting and tragic , while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Yousafzai had been very brave in standing up for the rights of girls and that the attackers had been threatened by that kind of empowerment . British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the shooting barbaric and that it had shocked Pakistan and the world . American singer Madonna dedicated her song Human Nature to Yousafzai at a concert in Los Angeles the day of the attack, as well had a temporary Malala tattoo on her back. American actress Angelina Jolie wrote an article about explaining the event to her children and answering questions like Why did those men think they needed to kill Malala Jolie later donated 200,000 to the Malala Fund for girls' education. Former First Lady of the United States Laura Bush wrote an op ed piece in The Washington Post in which she compared Yousafzai to Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. Indian director Amjad Khan announced that he would be making a biographical film based on Yousafzai. Ehsanullah Ehsan, chief spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that Yousafzai is the symbol of the infidels and obscenity , adding that if she survived, the group would target her again. In the days following the attack, the Taliban reiterated its justification, saying Yousafzai had been brainwashed by her father We warned him several times to stop his daughter from using dirty language against us, but he didn't listen and forced us to take this extreme step. The Taliban also justified its attack as part of religious scripture, stating that the Quran says that people propagating against Islam and Islamic forces would be killed , going on to say that Sharia says that even a child can be killed if he is propagating against Islam . On 12 October 2012, a group of 50 Islamic clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwa a ruling of Islamic law against the Taliban gunmen who tried to kill Yousafzai. Islamic scholars from the Sunni Ittehad Council publicly denounced attempts by the Pakistani Taliban to mount religious justifications for the shooting of Yousafzai and two of her classmates. Although the attack was roundly condemned in Pakistan, some fringe Pakistani political parties and extremist outfits have aired conspiracy theories, such as the shooting being staged by the American Central Intelligence Agency to provide an excuse for continuing drone attacks. The Pakistani Taliban and some other pro Taliban elements branded Yousafzai an American spy . On 15 October 2012, UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, visited Yousafzai while she was in the hospital, and launched a petition in her name and in support of what Malala fought for . Using the slogan I am Malala , the petition's main demand was that there be no child left out of school by 2015, with the hope that girls like Malala everywhere will soon be going to school . Brown said he would hand the petition to President Zardari in Islamabad in November. The petition contains three demands The day after the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated that the Taliban gunman who shot Yousafzai had been identified. Police named 23 year old Atta Ullah Khan, a graduate student in chemistry, as the gunman in the attack. As of 2015 he remained at large, possibly in Afghanistan. The police also arrested six men for involvement in the attack, but they were later released due to lack of evidence. In November 2012, US sources confirmed that Mullah Fazlullah, the cleric who ordered the attack on Yousafzai, was hiding in Eastern Afghanistan. He was killed by a U.S. Afghan air strike in June 2018. On 12 September 2014, ISPR Director, Major General Asim Bajwa, told a media briefing in Islamabad that the 10 attackers belong to a militant group called Shura . General Bajwa said that Israrur Rehman was the first militant group member who was identified and apprehended by the troops. Acting upon the information received during his interrogation, all other members of the militant group were arrested. It was an intelligence based joint operation conducted by ISI, police, and military. In April 2015, the ten who were arrested were sentenced to life in prison by Judge Mohammad Amin Kundi, a counterterrorism judge, with the chance of eligibility for parole, and possible release, after 25 years. It is not known if the actual would be murderers were among the ten sentenced. In June 2015, it was revealed that eight of the ten men tried in camera for the attack had in fact been secretly acquitted, insiders revealed one of the men acquitted and freed was the murder bid's mastermind. It is believed that all other men who shot Yousafzai fled to Afghanistan afterwards and were never even captured. The information about the release of suspects came to light after the London Daily Mirror attempted to locate the men in prison. Senior police official Salim Khan stated that the eight men were released because there was not enough evidence to connect them to the attack. Yousafzai at the Girl Summit in London Yousafzai expressing her concerns to Barack Obama that drone attacks are fueling terrorism Yousafzai spoke before the United Nations in July 2013, and had an audience with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. In September, she spoke at Harvard University, and in October, she met with US President Barack Obama and his family during that meeting, she confronted him on his use of drone strikes in Pakistan. In December, she addressed the Oxford Union. In July 2014, Yousafzai spoke at the Girl Summit in London. In October 2014, she donated 50,000 to the UNRWA for reconstruction of schools on the Gaza Strip. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, Yousafzai did not describe herself as a feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. On 12 July 2015, her 18th birthday, Yousafzai opened a school in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, for Syrian refugees. The school, funded by the not for profit Malala Fund, offers education and training to girls aged 14 to 18 years. Yousafzai called on world leaders to invest in books, not bullets . Yousafzai has repeatedly condemned the Rohingya persecution in Myanmar. In June 2015, the Malala Fund released a statement in which Yousafzai argues that the Rohingya people deserve citizenship in the country where they were born and have lived for generations along with equal rights and opportunities. She urges world leaders, particularly in Myanmar, to halt the inhuman persecution of Burma's Muslim minority Rohingya people. In September 2017, speaking in Oxford, Yousafzai said This should be a human rights issue. Governments should react to it. People are being displaced, they're facing violence. Yousafzai also posted a statement on Twitter calling for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to condemn the treatment of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. Suu Kyi has avoided taking sides in the conflict, or condemning violence against the Rohingya people, leading to widespread criticism. In 2014, Yousafzai stated that she wished to return to Pakistan following her education in the U.K., and inspired by Benazir Bhutto, she would consider running for prime minister If I can help my country by joining the government or becoming the prime minister, I would definitely be up for this task. She repeated this aim in 2015 and 2016. However, Yousafzai noted in 2018 that her goal had changed, stating that now that I have met so many presidents and prime ministers around the world, it just seems that things are not simple and there are other ways that I can bring the change that I want to see . In an interview with David Letterman, for Netflix's show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, Yousafzai was asked Would you ever want to hold a political position and replied Me No. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arranged for Yousafzai's appearance before the United Nations in July 2013. Brown also requested that McKinsey consultant Shiza Shahid, a friend of the Yousafzai family, chair Yousafzai's charity fund, which had gained the support of Angelina Jolie. Google's vice president Megan Smith also sits on the fund's board. In November 2012, the consulting firm Edelman began work for Yousafzai on a pro bono basis, which according to the firm involves providing a press office function for Malala . The office employs five people, and is headed by speechwriter Jamie Lundie. McKinsey also continues to provide assistance to Yousafzai. On 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event Malala Day . Yousafzai wore one of Benazir Bhutto's shawls to the UN. It was her first public speech since the attack, leading the first ever Youth Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education advocates from around the world. The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born ... I am not against anyone, neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all terrorists and extremists. Yousafzai received several standing ovations. Ban Ki moon, who also spoke at the session, described her as our hero . Yousafzai also presented the chamber with The Education We Want , a Youth Resolution of education demands written by Youth for Youth, in a process co ordinated by the UN Global Education First Youth Advocacy Group, telling her audience Malala day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights. The Pakistani government did not comment on Yousafzai's UN appearance, amid a backlash against her in Pakistan's press and social media. Words from the speech were used as lyrics for Speak Out , a song by Kate Whitley commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast on International Women's Day 2017. On 10 October 2014, Yousafzai was announced as the co recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Having received the prize at the age of 17, Yousafzai is the youngest Nobel laureate. Yousafzai shared the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. She is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize after 1979 Physics laureate Abdus Salam. After she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the decision. A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize This is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament. Adan Cortes, a college student from Mexico City and asylum seeker, interrupted Yousafzai's Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in protest for the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping in Mexico, but was quickly taken away by security personnel. Yousafzai later sympathised, and acknowledged that problems are faced by young people all over the world, saying there are problems in Mexico, there are problems even in America, even here in Norway, and it is really important that children raise their voices . In March 2018, Yousafzai was the subject of an interview with David Letterman for his Netflix show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. Speaking about the Taliban, she opined that their misogyny comes from a superiority complex, and is reinforced by finding excuses in culture or literature, such as by misinterpreting teachings of Islam. On the topic of her attackers, Yousafzai comments that I forgive them because that's the best revenge I can have . Pointing out that the person who attacked her was a young boy, she says that He thought he was doing the right thing . Asked about the presidency of Donald Trump, Yousafzai said Some of the things have really disappointed me, like sexual harassment and the ban on Muslims and racism. She also criticised the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to education, saying that education is the first step to eradicating extremism and ending poverty . Throughout the episode, clips are shown of Yousafzai acting as a tour guide for prospective students to her college Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. From March 2013 to July 2017, Yousafzai was a pupil at the all girls Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. In August 2015, she received 6 A s and 4 As at GCSE level. At A Level, she studied Geography, History, Mathematics and Religious Studies. Also applying to Durham, Warwick and the London School of Economics, Yousafzai was interviewed at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in December 2016 and received a conditional offer of three As in her A Levels in August 2017, she was accepted to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics PPE . Reception of Yousafzai in Pakistan is mostly negative. Yousafzai's opposition to Taliban policy makes her unpopular among Taliban sympathisers. A Dawn columnist alleges that she is scapegoated by the failing state government, and a journalist in The Nation wrote that Yousafzai is hated by overzealous patriots who are keen to deny oppression of women in the country. Yousafzai's statements conflict with the view that militancy in Pakistan is a result of Western interference, and conservatives and Islamic fundamentalists describe her ideology as anti Pakistan and anti Islam . In 2015, the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation APPSF banned I Am Malala in all Pakistani private schools, and the president Mirza Kashif Ali released a book I Am Not Malala. The book accuses Yousafzai of attacking Pakistan's army under the pretence of female education, describes her father as a double agent and a traitor and denounces the Malala Fund's promotion of secular education. However, Ali claimed that we are not against her but the ideology being imposed on us and pointed out that the APPSF went on a national strike when Yousafzai was attacked. Conspiracy theorists in newspapers and on social media have alleged that Yousafzai staged her assassination attempt, or that she is an agent of the American Central Intelligence Agency. Many Pakistanis view her as an agent of the West , due to her Nobel prize, Oxford education and residence in England. Another conspiracy theory alleges that Yousafzai is a Jewish agent. However, Yousafzai does have some support in Pakistani media Farman Nawaz argues that Yousafzai would have gained more fame in Pakistan if she belonged to the province of Punjab. His opinion was not given importance by the mainstream media of Pakistan but his views in this regard were published by Daily Outlook Afghanistan. Yousafzai is seen as courageous by some Pakistanis. On 29 March 2018, Yousafzai returned to Pakistan for the first time since the shooting. Meeting Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, she gave a speech in which she said it had been her dream to return without any fear . Yousafzai then visited her hometown Mingora in Swat Valley. The APPSF, a group representing the 173,000 private schools in Pakistan, organised I am not Malala Day on 30 March. Yousafzai responded by saying I am proud of my religion, and I am proud of my country. On 7 August 2019, following the Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Malala expressed her worry about the situation and applealed to the international community to ensure peace in Kashmir. On 14 September 2019, Malala posted a controversial tweet, in which she said that a Kashmiri girl told her I feel purposeless and depressed because I cant go to school. I missed my exams on August 12 and I feel my future is insecure now. However, many Twitter users pointed out that 12 August was Eid al Adha, a public holiday in India when schools were closed across the country, so an exam would not be possible on that day. After her tweet, she was trolled widely on Twitter. Indian shooter Heena Sidhu responded to Malala Ok, so you propose handing over Kashmir to Pakistan because over there girls like yourself have had too good of an education that you nearly lost your life and ran away from your country, never to return. Why dont you show us by going back to Pakistan first BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje asked Malala to spend time with minorities in Pakistan. She was also being accused of spreading the Pakistani agenda over Kashmir and being selective in the protest. Pakistani Canadian writer Tahir Aslam Gora also criticized her and asked Have you ever spoken to lawyers and human rights activists who are aware of brutalities on Baloch, Pashtun, Muhajir, and Sindhis What's your agenda on Kashmir British columnist Katie Hopkins lashed out at Malala over the alleged murder of Namrita Chandani, a Sindhi Hindu medical student in Sindh, Pakistan. Hopkins wrote Another Hindu girl, butchered in Pakistan. And suddenly the world is deaf and dumb. Where are you now Malala Cat got your tongue Yousafzai has received the following national and international honours, listed by the date they were awarded Yousafzai's memoir I Am Malala The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, co written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was published in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld Nicolson in the UK. A reviewer for The Guardian called the book fearless and stated that the haters and conspiracy theorists would do well to read this book , though she criticised the stiff, know it all voice of a foreign correspondent that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. A reviewer for The Washington Post called the book riveting and wrote It is difficult to imagine a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank. Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B , writing Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted. A children's edition of the memoir was published in 2014 under the title I Am Malala How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. According to Publishers Weekly, in 2017 the book had sold almost 2 million copies, and there were 750,000 copies of the children's edition in print. Yousafzai was the subject of the 2015 documentary He Named Me Malala, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. In 2017, a Hindi biopic film Gul Makai was announced, with Reem Sameer Shaikh portraying her. Yousafzai authored a picture book, Malala's Magic Pencil, which was illustrated by Kerascoet and published on 17 October 2017. By March 2018, The Bookseller reported that the book had over 5,000 sales in the UK. In a review for The Guardian, Imogen Carter describes the book as enchanting , opining that it strikes just the right balance between heavy handed and heartfelt , and is a welcome addition to the frustratingly small range of children's books that feature BAME central characters . Rebecca Gurney of The Daily Californian gives the book a grade of 4.5 out of 5, calling it a beautiful account of a terrifying but inspiring tale and commenting Though the story begins with fantasy, it ends starkly grounded in reality. In March 2018, it was announced that Yousafzai's next book We Are Displaced True Stories of Refugee Lives would be published on 4 September 2018 by Little, Brown and Company's Young Readers division. The book is about refugees, and includes stories from Yousafzai's own life along with those of people she has met. Speaking about the book, Yousafzai said that What tends to get lost in the current refugee crisis is the humanity behind the statistics and people become refugees when they have no other option. This is never your first choice. Profits from the book will go to Yousafzai's charity Malala Fund. She visited Australia and criticized its asylum policies and compared immigration policies of the U.S. and Europe unfavourably to those of poor countries and Pakistan. The book was released on 8 January 2019.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala%20Yousafzai
"The Youth Olympic Games YOG is an international multi sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format, though in reverse order with Winter Games held in leap years instead of Summer Games. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee IOC members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved the creation of a youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the travelling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes. Several other Olympic events for youth, like the European Youth Olympic Festival held every other year with summer and winter versions, and the Australian Youth Olympic Festival, have proven successful. The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events. The YOG are also a successor to the discontinued World Youth Games. The Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days, whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and Lillehammer in 2016 had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days. Even though this exceeded initial estimates, the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents. The most recent Summer YOG was the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires. The next Winter YOG to take place will be the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne while the 2022 Summer Youth Olympics will take place in Dakar. The concept of the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian industrial manager Johann Rosenzopf in 1998. This was in response to growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities, especially amongst youth in developed nations. It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games. Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people, the IOC's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative. IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much about cultural education and exchange as it was about sports, which is why the Culture and Education Program CEP was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games. Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007. There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values. The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008. On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck, host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012. The scale of the Youth Olympic Games is smaller than that of the Olympics, which is intentional and allows for smaller cities to host an Olympic event. Potential host cities are required to keep all events within the same city and no new sports venues should be built. Exceptions to this building moratorium include a media centre, amphitheatre facilities for classes and workshops, and a village for coaches and athletes. This village is to be the heart of the Games for the athletes, and the hub of activity. No new or unique transportation systems are required as all athletes and coaches will be transported by shuttles. According to bid procedures, the track and field stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies must hold 10,000 people, and a city must have a 2,500 seat aquatics facility for Summer editions . The original estimated costs for running the Games were US 30 million for the Summer and 15 million to 20 million for Winter Games, these costs do not include infrastructure improvements for venue construction. The IOC has stipulated that costs for infrastructure and venues is to be paid by the host city. The IOC will pay travel costs to the host city and room and board for the athletes and judges, estimated at 11 million. The funding will come from IOC funds and not revenues. The budgets for the final two bids for the inaugural Summer Games as submitted by the IOC came in at 90 million, much higher than the estimated costs. The cost of the first games in Singapore escalated to an estimated S 387 million 284 million . Sponsors have been slow to sign on for the YOG, due to the fact that it is a new initiative and corporations are not sure what level of exposure they will get. The budget for the inaugural Winter Games to be held in Innsbruck has been estimated at 22.5 million, which does not include infrastructure improvements and venue construction. Over 200 countries and 3,600 athletes participated in the inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics. Participants are placed in the following age groups 1415 years, 1617 years, and 1718 years. The athlete's age is determined by how old he or she is by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG. Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations ISF for the various sports on the program. To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places. A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under represented nations regardless of qualifying marks. This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games. For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval. There is a cap of two teams one boys' and one girls' per nation. Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports. 37 sports from 2010 to 2022 Olympic program at one point to another. Twenty seven sports were introduced in the 2010 Games, two new sports were introduced in 2014 Games which were beach volleyball and field hockey. In the 2018 Games six sports were introduced which were beach handball, breakdancing, futsal, karate, roller speed skating and sport climbing. Football and handball were not introduced. 28 core sports are expected to feature in the 2022 Games, being confirmed in 2019. Four sports added to the 2018 Games sport climbing, karate, breakdancing and roller speed skating will not be featured but beach soccer will be new. 16 sports, 46 disciplines in the Winter Youth Olympics between the 2012 Games to the 2020 Games. In the 2012 Games at Innsbruck and the 2016 Games at Lillehammer, there were only 15 sports. In the next Games which will be the 2020 Games at Lausanne, there will be a new sport added which is ski mountaineering. Education and culture are also key components for the Youth edition. Not only does the education culture aspect apply to athletes and participants, but also youth around the world and inhabitants of the host city and surrounding regions. To this end, a Culture and Education Program CEP will be featured at each Games. The first CEP at the 2010 Singapore Games featured events that fostered cooperation amongst athletes of different nations. It had classes on topics ranging from health and fitness to the environment and career planning. Local students from Singapore made booths at the World Culture Village that represented each of the 205 participating National Olympic Committee. The Chat with Champions sessions were the most popular portion of the program. Participants were invited to hear inspirational talks given by former and current Olympic athletes. Also part of the CEP is the Young Ambassadors Programme, Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models. Under the Young Ambassadors Programme, a group of youths aged 18 to 25 years old are nominated by the NOCs to help promote the YOG in their regions and communities, and encourage the athletes to participate in the CEP programmes. The Young Reporters Programme provides journalism students or those who have recently started their journalism careers a cross platform journalist training programme and on the job experience during the YOG. Young Reporters, between the ages of 18 and 24, are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents. Acting as mentors to help support and advise young Olympians are the Athlete Role Models, who are typically active or recently retired Olympians nominated by the IFs, such as Japanese wrestler Kaori Icho, Italian Simone Farina and Namibian Frank Fredericks. Emphasis on exchange goes beyond the CEP. Another unique feature of the Youth Olympic Games is mixed gender and mixed national teams. Triathlon relays, fencing, table tennis, archery and mixed swimming relays are a few of the sports in which athletes from different nations and mixed genders can compete together. YOG organizers are also using social media such as Facebook, Flikr, and Twitter as key platforms for engaging young athletes before, during, and after each celebration of the Games. Multi lingual, multi cultural, and multi age requirements are the targets of the program, which stress the themes of Learning to know, learning to be, learning to do, and learning to live together . In early November 2007, Athens, Bangkok, Singapore, Moscow, and Turin were selected by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. In January 2008, the candidates were further pared down to just Moscow and Singapore. Finally, on 21 February 2008, Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne, Switzerland, winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow. On 2 September 2008 IOC announced that the executive board had shortlisted four cities among the candidates to host the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012. The four candidate cities were Harbin, Innsbruck, Kuopio, and Lillehammer. IOC president Jacques Rogge appointed Pernilla Wiberg to chair the commission which analysed the projects. As with the Summer Games, the list was then shortened to two finalists, Innsbruck and Kuopio, in November 2008. On 12 December 2008, it was announced that Innsbruck beat Kuopio to host the games. Nanjing, China was selected by the IOC over Poznan, Poland to be the host city of the 2014 Youth Olympics. The election was held on 10 February 2010, two days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Lillehammer, Norway hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth%20Olympic%20Games
"Youthanasia is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on 1 November 1994 through Capitol Records. The album is not a large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of the previous album Countdown to Extinction 1992 . The album's title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track. Youthanasia received positive reviews upon its release. It was commercially successful, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified platinum for shipping one million copies in the United Statesa distinction achieved in 1995. A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on 27 July 2004. Megadeth's previous studio release, Countdown to Extinction, became the band's biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the Billboard 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold out arenas across North America, in addition to developing a strong following overseas. With the next album, Youthanasia, the band moved towards a more mainstream sound. It was a time of problems and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every two weeks or so, according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were outrageous emotional interventions in order to make the group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine's creative control over a successful formula , so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona. The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios Tempe in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May this studio is often the location for scenes in the Evolver video. Producer Max Norman suggested that they build a new self dedicated studio, in cooperation with the band, Capitol and Max's funding a modular studio was built in a warehouse in South Phoenix. Talking about the recording process, Mustaine said that Youthanasia was written solely in the studio. We weren't playing any old, cataloged material. None of the past really influenced the new record. He mentioned that he gave more freedom to the other members and called the album very much a total band effort . Of interest is that this was hoped to be the first album recorded solely on hard drives rather than magnetic tape , Both Max and Dave were believers in being on the cutting edge of technology, Max had long been using computers to sample, tune and comp tracks. Digidesign was working on expanding Pro Tools from a single track to multitracking and it was hoped that as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400 500 models and with a great effort by all, it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used. The cover art by Hugh Syme features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, We've been hung out to dry . He explained that the title track was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about the young people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'. The title is a combination of the words youth and euthanasia . Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting. The album was released on 1 November 1994 through Capitol Records. Promotion included the first official website for a band, Megadeth, Arizona , described by its conceiver, Robin Sloan Bechtel, as a virtual cybertown in cyberspace where fans gathered in an online community that among other things offered news regarding Megadeth's new album. Youthanasia was commercially successful, debuting and peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200, with 143,000 units sold in its first week. This marked the band's second top five album, slightly below the number two peak of Countdown to Extinction in 1992, and the band would only reach such a landmark again in 2016 with Dystopia. Several weeks after its release, the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA for shipping one million copies in the United States. The album also managed to enter into the top 10 in the United Kingdom and some other European countries as well. It eventually received a platinum certification from Music Canada and a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry BPI for shipments of 100,000 and 60,000 copies, respectively. A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on 27 July 2004. Three singles were released from Youthanasia Reckoning Day , Train of Consequences and A Tout le Monde . The latter would later be re recorded with Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia under the title A Tout le Monde Set Me Free . This version was also released as a single, and included on United Abominations 2007 . Both Train of Consequences and A Tout le Monde charted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. A special promotional copy of the album was issued with an essay by suspense novelist Dean Koontz entitled Godzilla vs. Megadeth . Youthanasia was not a large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings. According to Billboard, from the drumbeat opening of Addicted to Chaos to the precise instrumentation of Train of Consequences , Megadeth delivered trademark aggressive rage 'n' roll to powerful effect . Billboard noted that even the slower songs such as A Tout le Monde were tending toward lusty explosion . Authors Pete Prown and HP Newquist opined that lyrically, Youthanasia contained more thematic variations from Megadeth. They wrote that the record was musically diverse, from the slow tempo acoustic lines of A Tout le Monde to the breakneck riffing of Train of Consequences and Family Tree . Q found that Megadeth's trademark crunchy riffs, thundering drums and bitter vocals were still present on the album, with the lyrics being more introspective. Dave Mustaine, on the album's genre Mike Stagno said that Youthanasia features a more traditional type of metal . He explained that even though the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is very scarce on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, progressive elements in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of Exclaim felt that with Youthanasia, the band eroded their brilliant thrash to mid paced chug . According to the band's official website, Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album. Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then guitarist Marty Friedman stated We pretty much stick to our guns. It's not like we're gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times. The album received positive reviews upon its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for AllMusic, commented that, compared to Countdown to Extinction the album lacks focus. However, Erlewine suggested that the album's production quality made up for that. He also commented favorably on Train of Consequences , calling out its jackhammer riffs . Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic reviewed the album positively. Though noting that the album, like its predecessor, was a distinct move away from the sound heard on 1990s Rust in Peace, Stagno suggested that the lack of a fast tempo is made up for by the catchiness of the tracks. In a contemporary review, Q magazine wrote that Youthanasia has greater depth and breadth than its predecessors . Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly, gave a brief review of the album saying that Youthanasia would impress, but not impact. Neil Arnold of Metal Forces named the record the last true Megadeth opus before the mid to late 90s slump . He further said that the album pales in comparison to the previous records, but still keeps the band in their element. Paul Corio, in a retrospective review for Rolling Stone, wrote that the album features metal machine music that is calibrated to kill . He highlighted Elysian Fields and Victory as examples of Mustaine in his prime. Despite the outcry of some fans, Pete Prown called Youthanasia more than worthy follow up to Countdown to Extinction. In 2014, Guitar World ranked Youthanasia at number 29 on their list of Superunknown 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 . Megadeth toured heavily in support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live performances in South America. The tour continued in 1995, with a number of opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans So far, the audiences have been really good and it seems to me that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been . The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners. In the middle of 1995, the band underwent changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager would go on to be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there was a possibility of Megadeth performing the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20 year anniversary of the record's release. All tracks are written by Dave Mustaine, except where noted. . On the 2004 reissue of the album, Dave Mustaine credits all songs to Ellefson Friedman Menza Mustaine Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. sales figures based on certification alone shipments figures based on certification alone",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youthanasia
"Yonal Ahk III Mayan pronunciation , also known as Ruler 5, was an ajaw of Piedras Negras, an ancient Maya settlement in Guatemala. He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 758 to 767 AD. Yonal Ahk III ascended to the throne upon the death of Itzam Kan Ahk II, who may have been Yonal Ahk's father. He was succeeded by his probable brother, Ha Kin Xook in around 767 AD. Yonal Ahk III left behind two surviving stelae at Piedras Negras, namely Stelae 14 and 16, the former of which has been called one of the finest niche stelae, according to Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube. Yonal Ahk III, also known as Ruler 5, was likely the son of Itzam Kan Ahk II, based on Yonal Ahk III's veneratiion of Itzam Kan Ahk II's mortuary temple. Yonal Ahk III, whose name translates to Black House Great Turtle , ascended to the throne of Piedras Negras on March 10, 758 AD 9.16.6.17.1 7 Imix 19 Wo in the Long Count , following the death of Itzam Kan Ahk II. Not much is known about either Yonal Ahk III or his successor Ha Kin Xook, which led Flora Clancy to refer to both their reigns as shadowy . James L. Fitzsimmons argues that, politically, Yonal Ahk III was weaker than previous leaders of Piedras Negras, given that the ajaw erected only a handful of monuments and did not enforce his power beyond the existing Piedras Negras hegemony. Monuments at El Cayo record that Yonal Ahk III was involved in burial ceremonies for a sajal in 763 AD, although he was not involved in picking the leader's successor. It is also known that during his reign, a kini ajaw prince of Piedras Negras, Tul Chiik, was captured by Yaxun Balam IV of Yaxchilan it has been hypothesized that Yonal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and Yax Niil was a tactic to build up a base of support to combat the growing threat that Yaxchilan posed. Yonal Ahk III was succeeded by Ha Kin Xook, who was possibly his brother. Only two monuments that Yonal Ahk III erected survive today Stelae 14 and 16. The first of these, Stela 14which Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube called the finest of all 'niche' monuments is the king's accession memorial. Raised c. AD 761, it depicts an effigy of the king in a small hollow or niche scattering incense. The monument was placed on the lower part of Structure O 13, and according to O'Neil, the stela's form, imagery, and location acknowledged and responded to Structure O 13's participation in the processional circuit of the site. The front of the monument features not only the ajaw, but also his mother standing as witness to her son. Her positioning likely suggested that she has just arrived from the West Group Plaza via a sacred route. Stela 14 also includes the names of several sculptors and artists. These names are difficult to translate, since many are unique and not found in any other extant Mayan glyphic texts. Stela 16 celebrates the accession of a local sajal or lesser Maya leader at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. This stela caused Tatiana Proskouriakoff to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras as this sajal, instead of Ha Kin Xook. The uniqueness of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, at the time of Yonal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance within the Piedras Negras hegemony . The front of the stela is heavily weathered, but Megan O'Neil argues it likely featured a carving of Yonal Ahk III, based on comparisons with other stelae at Piedras Negras, like Stelae 6 and 11.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo%CA%BCnal%20Ahk%20III
"Ypresiomyrma is an extinct genus of ants in the subfamily Myrmeciinae that was described in 2006. There are four species described one species is from the Isle of Fur in Denmark, two are from the McAbee Fossil Beds in British Columbia, Canada, and the fourth from the Bolshaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site in Russia. The queens of this genus are large, the mandibles are elongated and the eyes are well developed a stinger is also present. The behaviour of these ants would have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants, such as solitary foraging for arthropod prey and never leaving pheromone trails. The alates were poor flyers due to their size, and birds and animals most likely preyed on these ants. Ypresiomyrma is not assigned to any tribe, and is instead generally regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae. However, some authors believe Ypresiomyrma should be assigned as incertae sedis within Formicidae. Fossils of Ypresiomyrma were first studied and described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They published their 2006 description of the genus and species in an Annals of the Entomological Society of America journal article. The genus name is a combination of Ypresian, referring to the age of the specimens and the Greek myrmex, meaning ant . The minimum fossil age is approximately 54.5 to 55.5 million years. Along with the genus description, the paper contained descriptions of the type species Ypresiomyrma orbiculata and Ypresiomyrma bartletti, both from the McAbee Fossil Beds in British Columbia, part of the Eocene Okanagan Highlands lake system. Archibald, Cover and Moreau also included a redescription of the Danish species Pachycondyla rebekkae under the new name combination Ypresiomyrma rebekkae. A fourth species, Ypresiomyrma orientalis was described in 2015. Archibald and colleagues originally classified Ypresiomyrma as incertae sedis Latin for of uncertain placement within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the ants could not be identified to any tribe level. However, a 2008 paper by Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, expressed doubt that members of Ypresiomyrma were even ants. He notes that the development of the malar area an area between the compound eyes and the mandibles was different and not reduced, as a reduced malar is synapomorphic key diagnostic traits in Myrmeciinae. Baroni Urbani further notes that the antennae's shape on the type species could not be properly determined, making its true placement within Formicidae indeterminable. However, the antennae of Y. rebekkae has an elongated scape which means the fossil is definitely an ant, as this feature is a key diagnostic trait for Formicidae. Due to this, Baroni Urbani believed that Ypresiomyrma could only be confidently classified as incertae sedis within the family Formicidae. A subsequent report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky describing new myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues without mentioning the comments of Baroni Urbani. The following cladogram generated by Archibald and colleagues show the possible phylogenetic position of Ypresiomyrma among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. The genus may be closely related to other extinct Myrmeciinae genera, including Avitomyrmex and Macabeemyrma, and the extant Nothomyrmecia macrops. Archimyrmex Myrmecia Prionomyrmex janzeni Prionomyrmex longiceps Macabeemyrma Avitomyrmex Ypresiomyrma Nothomyrmecia There are several characteristics that separate Ypresiomyrma from other ant genera. The waist connecting the thorax and the abdomen in Ypresiomyrma is composed of a single segment. The head in each species varies in shape, and mandibles are a distinct triangular shape and shorter than the head capsule with eight to twelve teeth, although they are elongated. Queens of the genus are large, measuring over 20 millimetres 0.79 in . Other characters include large, well developed eyes, a rounded propodeal dorsum and a noticeable stinger. Y. orbiculata was described from a single part and counterpart compression fossil found at the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The type specimens numbered UCCIPR L 18 F 749 and UCCIPR L 18 F 750 for the part and counterpart is currently preserved in the palaeoentomology collections housed at Thompson Rivers University, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet from the Latin orbiculatus , meaning rounded or circular , in reference to the shape of the head. The species is discernible from the other two species of Ypresiomyrma by its notably rounded head capsule, and by the shape of the petiole which has a smoothly sloping convex shape with a node in the center. The petiole is similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex janzeni, and the propodeum is round. The queen is estimated to have been approximately 25 millimetres 0.98 in . The compound eyes are large and oval shape, but the antennae cannot be described due to poor preservation. The mandibles are large, containing seven to eight teeth. A well developed stinger is also present. The second species described from the McAbee Fossil Beds is Y. bartletti which, like Y. orbiculata, is known from a single queen specimen. The holotype part and counterpart are included in the Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa collections as GSC 127632a and GSC 127632b. The shape of the head is subtriangular, which separates it from Y. orbiculata, and at an estimated 20 millimetres 0.79 in it is smaller than Y. rebekkae. The petiole shape in Y. bartletti is distinct from both other species. The specific epithet was chosen in honor of Rod Bartlett who collected the specimen, and to honor his work with the Vancouver Paleontological Society and the British Columbia Paleontological Alliance. The antennae are not preserved and the eyes cannot be distinguished. The mandibles have around ten or fewer teeth. The forewings of the queen are faintly preserved, and portions of the legs are preserved and disarticulated. Some portions of the gaster are deformed and the specimen appears to be crushed, but the overall morphology of this species justifies its placement within Myrmeciinae. An undescribed worker in the form genus Myrmeciites may possibly be a Y. bartletti ant, but this cannot be confirmed due to its poor preservation. This species is known from over 100 specimens collected from the earliest Ypresian lst and Fur Formations, found in calcareous rocks. The specimens were first studied and described by Jes Rust and N. Mller Andersen in 1999, and they named the species for Rebekka Madsen who collected the type specimen in September 1994. The holotype and paratype queen described are well preserved, although the legs are missing the part and counterpart, GMUC No. 1995 8B and GMUC No. 1995 8A are deposited in the Geological Museum of the University of Copenhagen. At that time, Rust and Andersen placed the species into the modern ponerin genus Pachycondyla based on the shape of the abdominal segment VI and lack of dentition on the mandibles. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau moved the species to Ypresiomyrma based on the similarity to the McAbee species, by the shape of the abdominal segment III, which differs from that found in the Ponerinae subfamily genera, and by the morphology of the petiole. Y. rebekkae can be distinguished from other species by the shape of its petiole and the size of its head, being notably larger than Y. bartletti. The ants' somewhat angular head is also different, with other species having a rounded head. The species is known almost exclusively from queens, with only one known male ant assigned to it by Rust and Andersen. The average length of a queen is around 25 millimetres 0.98 in , with a robust body. The head is round, and the width and length are the same, measuring 4.5 millimetres 0.18 in . The eyes are oval shaped and developed, located near the middle of the head. The mandibles are triangular and long, with ten teeth present. The antennae are long with 11 segments, and the scape is 3.4 millimetres 0.13 in long. The mesosoma is 7 millimetres 0.28 in long and 4.5 millimetres 0.18 in wide. The mesosoma is convex and domed, and the pronotum is short. The petiole is 1.5 millimetres 0.059 in long and 2.3 millimetres 0.091 in in wide, and the gaster is swollen, but this is due to the early taphonomic process the transition of a decaying organism over time and how it becomes fossilised . A well developed stinger is present in the fossilized specimens. Only a single complete male is known from all the collected specimens. The body length is shorter in comparison to the queen caste, measuring 25 millimetres 0.98 in and it is also more slender. The head and mandibles are small, but the eyes are fully developed and large. The antennae are not preserved, and only small fragments of the legs are present. The gaster is smaller and more elongated, but the genitalia are not preserved. Y. orientalis was described from a part and counterpart holotype and a solitary forewing paratype compression fossil found at the late Eocene Bolshaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site, in the Sikhote Alin area of far eastern Russia. The type specimens numbered PIN 3429 1109 for the part and counterpart and PIN 3429 1198 are currently preserved in the A.A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute fossil collections of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva coined the specific epithet from the Latin orientalis , meaning eastern , in reference to the type locality. The species is discernible from Y. rebekkae by its smaller petiole node size. While there are no distinct differences between Y. orientalis and the two Okanagan Highlands species Y. bartletti and Y. orbiculata, the fossils were placed into a new species by Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva. This is due to the notable time difference between the highlands and Bolshaya Svetlovodnaya. Though the possible gyne is incomplete the estimated body length is 17.5 mm 0.69 in and the mesosoma is robust. The forewing has closed 1 2r, 3r, rm and mcu cells, with the 3r elongated while the 1 2r is shorted to just over twice as long as wide. The life habits of Ypresiomyrma would have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an arboreal nesting species. Workers were most likely solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers most likely did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down pheromone trails. Ypresiomyrma ants most likely used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes. The abundance of Ypresiomyrma queens collected suggests that these ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range would mean they were an important food source to a variety of birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypresiomyrma
"YpsiFest formerly Ypsilanti Heritage Festival is a festival in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Held each year on the 4th weekend of August, the festival sprawls across Frog Island Park, Riverside Park, and historic Depot Town. The festival features a variety of activities and entertainment including helicopter rides, acrobats and theater performances by Ring of Steel, evening concerts, gambling and bingo, and a huge kids zone full of children specific activities and rides. Additionally there are featured evens like Illumination YpsiFest where local business compete for prizes by creating illuminated sculptures for an evening display, and an illumination parade. Ypsilanti Press, July 16, 1978 The festival was first held on Saturday, July 15, 1978, from noon 'til nightfall . The sidewalks and streets in Depot Town had just been re paved, and the Depot Town Association held a Sidewalk Celebration . The poster advertised a noon sidewalk promenade led by the Honorable George Goodman Hizzoner the mayor of Ypsilanti and exciting ribbon cutting ceremonies, dedications and plain or fancy walkin'. The Sidewalk Celebration was such a success that a decision was made to repeat the event, to be known as the Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival . According to other reports, a motivating factor was the desire to establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A 15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival. In 1979, the festival drew 50,000 attendees, continued to grow quickly in subsequent years, and the name was soon shortened to the present name. By the mid 1980s the festival was attracting attention from non local newspapers a June 1985 edition of the Toledo Blade referred to it as an Old time circus, arts and crafts, and historic home tour and later that decade the festival was drawing more than 250,000 attendees a year, though attendance subsequently declined, and in recent years the festival has drawn about 100,000 attendees. The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival includes and has included a wide variety of activities and events. The Ypsilanti Historic Home Tour, held annually during the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival, began, like the festival proper, in 1979. A beer garden and gambling tent anchored the center of the festival from 1979 through 2010. In 2011 the gambling was eliminated for financial reasons, while the beer garden continued with an expanded food and drink selection however, in January, 2012, new festival director Andrew Clock announced that the casino will be back, set up right next to the beer tent, where it belongs. A bed race through downtown Ypsilanti was added as an annual event beginning in 2009. The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade began in 1979, and has been held every year. In 2007, the parade attracted wider attention when parade organizers approved the inclusion of a group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error. Because the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival has often been the same weekend as the Woodward Dream Cruise, festival coordinators decided it would be a blast to have something that was the direct opposite of the Dream Cruise , and the Nightmare Cruise, a spoof of the Woodward Dream Cruise, was born in 2005. The only rules are that he car has to be legally driveable, and fluid leaks should be at a minimum. Other events have included a pole vault competition sanctioned by USA Track Field, live theater, antique cars and fire engines, vintage base ball sponsored by Greenfield Village, Precious Pets and Beautiful Babies contests, a rubber duck race, a living history encampment, a high wire performance by one of The Flying Wallendas, and a circus. In 1973, Carolyn King, with support from the Ypsilanti City Council, became one of the first girls in the country to play Little League Baseball. When they found out that she was playing, Little League International officials pulled the Ypsilanti American Little League's charter, and the 1973 All Star game between the rival Ypsilanti American and National Little Leagues was never played. Thirty seven years later, the teams were re assembled with the players now in their late forties and the game was finally held, in Frog Island Park, as part of the 2010 festival. Billed as The Game That Never Was , the American League All Stars led by Carolyn, who led off and played center field won, 15 14.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypsilanti%20Heritage%20Festival
"Ysbeidiau Heulog pronounced sbidia hl English Sunny Intervals is the twelfth single by Super Furry Animals. It was the only single to be taken from the album Mwng and was released as a limited edition 7 vinyl on the band's own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the band's first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. The Welsh language song has been described by singer Gruff Rhys as throwaway pop and likened to the music of ELO, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Critical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers comparing the song to the work of Roxy Music. The track appears on 2004's singles compilation album Songbook The Singles, Vol. 1 but is not included on the DVD release as no music video was made. Singer Gruff Rhys has described Ysbeidiau Heulog as throwaway pop ... old time pop music , likening the song to the work of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment and that If there's any song that doesn't sum up it's 'Ysbeidiau Heulog' The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios, Cardiff and was engineered by Greg Haver. Overdubs were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. B side Charge was recorded for an episode of BBC Radio 1's The John Peel Show, which aired on 1 March 2000. The track was produced for the BBC by Simon Askew and engineered by Nick Fountain. Ysbeidiau Heulog is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody, which plays twice, accompanied by drums, bass, distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog with a vocoder being used on the second ysbeidiau heulog . This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the chords B, B, A and E twice with little sustain, joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted. The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing ysbeidiau heulog four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last heulog , the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word's two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes. After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once during the second half of the section, simply feedingback for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys' vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif . Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring flanging, playing several licks alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by flanging. The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature flanging. The track ends with an instrumental outro similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out. Ysbeidiau Heulog was released as a limited edition 7 vinyl single on the Super Furry Animal's own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the band's first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. It received a generally positive response from critics. The track was awarded 'Single of the Week' in the May 1016, 2000 issue of the Melody Maker by guest reviewers the Dum Dums who gave the song a perfect five star rating and claimed that it is a summery, karaoke pop hit . Pitchfork Media called Ysbeidiau Heulog the best track on parent album Mwng and described it as a decidedly retro number that combines the swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high tech vocal effects . In a 2006 feature on the Super Furry Animals' back catalogue Incendiary Magazine called the track a clever slice of pop . In a play on words on the track's meaning in English, Drowned in Sound stated that Ysbeidiau Heulog was Mwng's sunny interval and wouldn't feel out of place on 1999's Guerrilla. Both the NME and Rolling Stone likened the track to the work of Roxy Music with the former calling it happily woozy and the latter claiming it is a spunky, sax spiked bop . The NME also placed the track at number 33 in their single of the year list for 2000. Yahoo Music described the track as a playground free for all ... frazzled and psychedelic . Art Sperl, writing for Rock's Backpages in December 2000, was critical of the track, calling it flimsy . The track appears on vinyl and CD copies of the band's singles compilation album Songbook The Singles, Vol. 1 but is not included on the DVD release as no music video was made.

"Ytterbium is a chemical element with the symbol Yb and atomic number 70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series, which is the basis of the relative stability of its 2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is 3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides. In 1878, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated from the rare earth erbia another independent component, which he called ytterbia , for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, terbium and erbium . In 1907, the new earth lutecia was separated from ytterbia, from which the element lutecium now lutetium was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name ytterbium was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma ray source. Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard. Ytterbium is a soft, malleable and ductile chemical element that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It is a rare earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air. Ytterbium has three allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma their transformation temperatures are 13 C and 795 C, although the exact transformation temperature depends on the pressure and stress. The beta allotrope 6.966 g cm3 exists at room temperature, and it has a face centered cubic crystal structure. The high temperature gamma allotrope 6.57 g cm3 has a body centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope 6.903 g cm3 has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. The beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres 1.6 GPa . Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres 3.9 GPa , but then drops to about 10 of its room temperature resistivity at about 40,000 atm 4.0 GPa . In contrast with the other rare earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824 C and a boiling point of 1196 C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals. Contrary to most other lanthanides, which have a close packed hexagonal lattice, ytterbium crystallizes in the face centered cubic system. Ytterbium has a density of 6.973 g cm3, which is significantly lower than those of the neighboring lanthanides, thulium 9.32 g cm3 and lutetium 9.841 g cm3 . Its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium. This is due to the closed shell electron configuration of ytterbium 4f14 6s2 , which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available and increases ytterbium's metallic radius. Ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air. Finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas. Ytterbium is quite electropositive, and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium III hydroxide Ytterbium reacts with all the halogens The ytterbium III ion absorbs light in the near infrared range of wavelengths, but not in visible light, so ytterbia, Yb2O3, is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless. Ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the colorless Yb III ions, which exist as nonahydrate complexes Although usually trivalent, ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of 3. The 2 state has a valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f shell gives more stability. The yellow green ytterbium II ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium III ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the 2 state, but europium II is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts. Natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable isotopes 168Yb, 170Yb, 171Yb, 172Yb, 173Yb, 174Yb, and 176Yb, with 174Yb being the most common, at 31.8 of the natural abundance . 27 radioisotopes have been observed, with the most stable ones being 169Yb with a half life of 32.0 days, 175Yb with a half life of 4.18 days, and 166Yb with a half life of 56.7 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than two hours, and most of these have half lives under 20 minutes. Ytterbium also has 12 meta states, with the most stable being 169mYb t1 2 46 seconds . The isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 147.9674 atomic mass unit u for 148Yb to 180.9562 u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes. Ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand 0.03 ytterbium . The element is also found in euxenite and xenotime. The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3 mg kg. As an even numbered lanthanide, in accordance with the Oddo Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5 each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the Yb YAG laser, a solid state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. Ytterbium is often the most common substitute in yttrium minerals. In very few known cases occurrences ytterbium prevails over yttrium, as, e.g., in xenotime Yb . A report of native ytterbium from the Moon's regolith is known. It is relatively difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds. Ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3 . The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate. The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the 3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The 2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds for example, ytterbium II oxide YbO shows the same structure as calcium oxide CaO . Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature Some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium III chloride YbCl3 is a Lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the Aldol and DielsAlder reactions. Ytterbium II iodide YbI2 may be used, like samarium II iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium III fluoride YbF3 is used as an inert and non toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X ray contrast agent. Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium III oxide Yb2O3 , which crystallizes in the rare earth C type sesquioxide structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed, leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate non octahedral environments. Ytterbium III oxide can be reduced to ytterbium II oxide YbO with elemental ytterbium, which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride. Ytterbium was discovered by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878. While examining samples of gadolinite, Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia, and he named it ytterbia, for Ytterby, the Swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium. Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called ytterbium . In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac's ytterbia into two components neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later became known as the element ytterbium, and lutecia became known as the element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion exchange processes. The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US 1,000 kg. The 169Yb isotope with a half life of 32 days , which is created along with the short lived 175Yb isotope half life 4.2 days by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, has been used as a radiation source in portable X ray machines. Like X rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples which emit gamma rays act like tiny X ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X rays having energies between 250 and 350 keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine. Ytterbium clocks hold the record for stability with ticks stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion 21018 . The clocks developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST rely on about 10,000 rare earth atoms cooled to 10 microkelvin 10 millionths of a degree above absolute zero and trapped in an optical latticea series of pancake shaped wells made of laser light. Another laser that ticks 518 trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms. The large number of atoms is key to the clocks' high stability. Visible light waves oscillate faster than microwaves, and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt is working on several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point. A pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology has set a record for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion 1 followed by 18 zeros , roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable to the age of the universe. Ytterbium can also be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement, strength, and other mechanical properties of stainless steel. Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry. The Yb3 ion is used as a doping material in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.061.12 m band being optically pumped at wavelength 900 nm1 m, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling. The kinetic of excitations in ytterbium doped materials is simple and can be described within the concept of effective cross sections for most ytterbium doped laser materials as for many other optically pumped gain media , the McCumber relation holds, although the application to the ytterbium doped composite materials was under discussion. Usually, low concentrations of ytterbium are used. At high concentrations, the ytterbium doped materials show photodarkening glass fibers or even a switch to broadband emission crystals and ceramics instead of efficient laser action. This effect may be related with not only overheating, but also with conditions of charge compensation at high concentrations of ytterbium ions. Much progress has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium Yb doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1 kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities M2 1.1 at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at 1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium doped fibers. In order to achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be achieved only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 m systems. Ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistivity when subjected to high stresses. This property is used in stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions. Currently, ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium III oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium Teflon Viton MTV . Although ytterbium is fairly stable chemically, it is stored in airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen filled dry box to protect it from air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ytterbium
"Yu Kanda Japanese , Hepburn Kanda Yu is a character from D.Gray man, a manga series created by Japanese artist and writer Katsura Hoshino. Kanda is a young adult who is an exorcist from an organization known as the Black Order. Like the other exorcists in the order, he is in charge of destroying demonic enemies known as Akuma, created by a man known as the Millennium Earl. For this, he uses an object referred to as Innocence sealed within a Japanese sword. Kanda sides with the Black Order in their fight against the Earl's group, the Noah Family. Kanda is often cold and antisocial toward his allies, even disliking it when people refer to him by his given name, Yu. He often engages in fights with his frequent ally, the series' protagonist Allen Walker. As the series proceeds, it is revealed he is the result of an experiment from the Black Order that created his artificial body and merged it with the brain of a deceased exorcist. Outside the main series and the two anime adaptations, Kanda has also appeared in the D.Gray man light novels, the two video games of the series, and the crossover game Jump Ultimate Stars. The character was created to bring a change to the series' predominant Western setting, with his design being based on the samurai of feudal Japan. Hoshino found Kanda's physical attractiveness difficult to illustrate with many details to consider, she concentrated particularly on his eyes and hair. Due to the draft for his original backstory having multiple plot holes, Hoshino rewrote it. In the official one, Hoshino created Kanda's first friend, Alma Karma, who plays a major impact in his backstory and growth across the manga. Various voice actors have been employed for the character, in both the original Japanese and the English dubbed version. Kanda has been popular with the series' readers, often appearing in top ten lists of character polls and taking first place twice, much to Hoshino's surprise. He has also appeared in other polls focused on anime characters in general. Merchandise based on him has also been released. His appearances in the manga and anime series have been met with mixed reactions as result of Kanda's antisocial qualities, comparable with those seen in other series that have similar characters. On the other hand, his character development, specifically his relationship with Alma, his dynamic with Allen, and his backstory have earned Kanda praise. Response to Kanda's voice actors has also been both positive and negative. The character of Yu Kanda was carried over from an unpublished work created by Katsura Hoshino, who designed Kanda to introduce a change into D.Gray man's Western setting. vol. 8 140 Kanda's design came out very naturally according to her, because in her early manga, before she became a full time writer, she frequently drew boys with Japanese swords. She liked young samurais, such as Okita Soji of the Shinsengumi special police forces this influenced her designs for Kanda. He wears a long coat, and though series' protagonist Allen Walker wore a similar coat, Hoshino felt that the design better suited Kanda's defensive personality the long coat became Kanda's trademark Black Order outfit. Multiple hairstyles and character designs' were also considered by Hoshino before she chose the final version. Hoshino has said that she found Kanda difficult to illustrate due to his sex appeal. vol. 2 24 Ever since his introduction, Kanda made small appearances until the tenth. In the release of this volume, Hoshino joked about how she missed Kanda. In response, within the manga Kanda impaled Hoshino's own character avatar, claiming that Hoshino did not know how to illustrate him well, so that Kanda made few appearances in the series' beginning. vol. 10 204 Hoshino derived Kanda's surname from mitoshiro , or kanda , a rice paddy from which rice is offered to the gods. This is further addressed in volume twenty of the manga, which shows how Kanda was created in the Mitoshiro World during the Black Order's experiments to have more Apostles of God . In the backstory, the designs for Kanda and his best friend, Alma Karma, contrasted with each other, Kanda retaining his feminine looks while Alma was presented as more masculine. The original basis for Kanda's feminine looks is that he was the reincarnation of a woman he was seeking. When this idea was changed Karma, rather than Kanda himself, becomes the reincarnation of the woman , Kanda retained his androgynous look. When drawing Kanda, Hoshino pays more attention to the way she draws his hair and eyes, believing that the latter indicate the character's mood, that he speaks with his eyes . Hoshino said that she took more care in drawing the highlights in Kanda's hair than she did with Lenalee Lee, another character with long hair. She noted that Kanda's early design featured large eyes because she had difficulty drawing finer eyes. Kanda is well known in the series for his antisocial personality, which often resulted in readers asking the author about him. In one fan letter, it was asked if Kanda was well meaning on the inside, the main characters found it unrealistic. vol. 14 18 In another question, a fan wonders if Hoshino gave him the first name Yu due to its similarities with Japanese words that resemble The one who cannot read the atmosphere . Though Hoshino denied this, she admitted that Kanda can not read the atmosphere. While the characters deny that, the manga author confirmed that Kanda suffers from lack of tact. vol. 14 36 Hoshino referred to Kanda as the least intelligent protagonist in the series. vol. 3 106 Once Alma Karma's story arc finished in the series, Hoshino was able to finish Kanda's backstory, which she had promised to the manga's readers. It was originally very different and had too many inconsistencies. When the series was moved to a monthly serialization rather than weekly, Hoshino had rewritten Kanda's backstory. Once new prominent characters were introduced in the series, Hoshino felt that it was possible to tell Kanda and Alma's story. During this story's end, Allen sends both of them to the town of Martel for the two of them to gain their freedom. This town was the first one Allen and Kanda visited while working for the Order. She chose this place because Kanda and Alma's relationship overlapped with that of Guzol and Lala, two characters who had a romantic relationship. In an interview about this story arc, Hoshino explained why Kanda hates being called by his first name, saying that he did not have a last name when he was younger. During this time he was simply called Yu , Yu by the scientists of the Asian Headquarters of the Black Order and by his only friend, Karma. After being forced to kill Karma, Yu was given the surname Kanda by the character of Froi Tedoll, who acts like a fatherly figure to him. Once the arc finishes, Hoshino wanted to establish Kanda as having stayed on good terms with Allen, even though the two characters often clashed in previous chapters. As a result, she hinted to readers that the character would be back to help Allen, who had been put in a troubled situation after helping Kanda and Karma escape from the Black Order. She noted that as a result of this, Kanda became an easier character to write. Across the series, Kanda sees illusions of lotus flowers, but Hoshino says this holds no particular meaning for him. The flowers were actually seen during Kanda's previous life. For Kanda, seeing the lotus sinking in dirt would mean his death. The illusion also appeared the first time Kanda nearly killed Karma, and he began to think it was a curse. For the flashbacks, Kanda's first meeting with his future comrade, Noise Marie, was shortened. The original idea was for Kanda to see the corpses of all the people taking care of him. However, Hoshino thought this scene would be too horrific and removed it. Instead, in the official release of the series, Kanda finds most of the scientists' corpses alongside Alma. In the animated version of D.Gray man, Kanda was voiced by Takahiro Sakurai. Hoshino was impressed by the delivery of his lines when first seeing him while working in the making of the series. vol. 9 187 In the anime sequel, D.Gray man Hallow, Sakurai was replaced with Takuya Sato. In this series, Kanda's child self was voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga. In Funimation's English adaptation of the series, Kanda was voiced by Travis Willingham. Like Sakurai, Willingham was replaced with another actor, Ian Sinclair, for Hallow. A powerful Exorcist from the Black Order who combats demons known as Akuma, Yu Kanda first appears in D.Gray man's fifth manga chapter. There, Kanda attacks newcomer Allen Walker after the gate's guardian considers him cursed. ch. 5 While his comrade Lenalee Lee resolves this misunderstanding, Kanda continues this poor relationship with Allen during their first mission together. ch. 8 He also openly objects to the paternal way his master, General Froi Tiedoll, treats him, ch. 135 and he and Allen later start throwing insults and offensive statements at one another. ch. 89, 90 Kanda refuses to die until he finds a certain person . While fighting, Kanda uses a mythical fragment known as Innocence . It takes the form of an anti Akuma weapon, Mugen , lit. Six Illusions , seen as a Japanese sword. ch. 186 Mugen is capable of several techniques, including creation of illusions . ch. 10 Kanda uses these powers to fight the Akuma, as well as the Noah Family, who aim to destroy mankind. Once he joins his comrades in Edo in order to protect the Generals, Kanda is trapped inside a place known as Noah's Ark alongside them. ch. 86 There, he engages the Noah Skin Bolic to allow his allies to move to another room. Although Kanda defeats Bolic, the room is destroyed after Kanda pushes Mugen to its limit. Later, Allen manages to take control of the Ark's piano, which grants his wish of restoring it. ch. 97 Kanda then returns with them to the Black Order. ch. 133 It is later revealed that Kanda is a Second Exorcist an artificial body possessing the brain of an Exorcist who died thirty years before the storyline. The Black Order had launched the Synthetic Disciple Project nine years before, hoping that Second Exorcists would be able to synchronize with their Innocence. ch. 186, 187 In order for him to survive the synchronization tests, his body was created to heal much more quickly than that of an ordinary human through an Om tattooed on the left side of his chest. ch. 190 ch. 16 ch. 12,198 Kanda was the second Second Exorcist to awaken, after his friend Alma Karma. ch. 190 Driven insane after learning his origins, Alma killed the research staff and attacked Kanda However, Alma is instead killed by his friend, who wished to meet his past lover. ch. 193 In the main storyline, Alma is found afterwards found to be alive as an Akuma by the Noah, and tries to kill Kanda again in revenge. During the battle, Allen discovers that Alma is the reincarnation of the woman that Kanda had been looking for. ch. 198 After learning this, Kanda embraces Alma as both are transported by Allen to another place, hoping that the two would find peace. ch. 199 There, Alma dies shortly after telling Kanda that he loves him. ch. 200 Three months after Alma's death, Kanda returns to the Order. ch. 207 There, he makes peace with the scientist who started the Synthetic Disciple Project. Kanda's willingness to return and be an Exorcist causes Mugen to evolve into a Crystal type weapon, requiring Kanda to give part of his blood to wield it. ch. 208 Shortly afterwards, Kanda and a scientist named Johnny Gill go on a mission to find Allen who had escaped the Order after being treated as a Noah in order to thank him for giving him and Alma their happiness, as well as redemption for never caring that Walker was turning into a Noah while going on missions with him. ch. 210 Johnny and Kanda briefly find Allen but are attacked by Apocryphos, a sentient Innocence, who tries to rewrite Kanda's memories of Allen. However, Kanda is saved by Froi Tiedoll. He convinces him to become a General in order to regain his trust from the Order. ch. 217 As well as being in the manga and anime series, Kanda is a playable character in the two D.Gray man video games, D.Gray man Apostles of God and D.Gray man Requirements of a Instrumentalist, as well as in the crossover fighting game Jump Ultimate Stars. He appears in the D.Gray man light novels series by Kaya Kizaki. The first one, set before the series' beginnings, has Kanda on a mission to recover missing assistants of the Black Order in a village where a witch is rumored to live. He is a supporting character in the second novel, where he attends a party thrown by the Black Order. In the third novel, Kanda makes a brief appearance in the first chapter a scientist from the Asian Branch of the Black Order, Gigi Lujun, reveals that he once kissed Kanda as a child. This angers Kanda, causing him to leave the area. Yu Kanda has been highly popular with the D.Gray man reader base, often ranking in top ten polls. In the first poll, he ranked second to Allen, vol. 7 117 and in the next poll he took the top place. ch. 121 Kanda once again took second place in the third poll, losing to Allen, ch. 171 but took the first place again in the fourth and latest poll. Hoshino was surprised by Kanda's popularity with the readers, as she just saw him as a regular character. Merchandise based on Kanda's character has been released, including cosplay costumes, his sword Mugen, and wigs. For Halloween 2016, more merchandise related to Kanda and other characters was released, including a blue tonic. In a popularity poll by the Japanese web portal goo, Kanda was voted as the eighth most popular character with a ponytail. A poll by Animage magazine of the top 100 anime characters of 2016 ranked Kanda 76th for his role in Hallow. In a poll by Anime News Network, Kanda was voted as the seventh best male anime character with long hair. Kanda has received mixed reactions for his appearances in manga, anime, and other media ever since his introduction. UK Anime Network's Kevin Leathers simply referred to him as the resident emo , a brooding character who might develop later in the series. Erkael from Manga News compared him with several other characters, such as Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto, based on their antisocial personalities. Sheena McNeil from Sequentialtart said that while she found the character's personality to be cold , she still found his design and his anti Akuma weapon appealing. Despite finding issues with the anime adaptation of the series, Anime News Network's Casey Brienza commented that Kanda was a fan favorite character like Komui Lee, both of which have traits that appeal to the audience. Animation Insider's Kimberly Morales enjoyed the contrast between Kanda and Allen's different personalities. John Rose from The Fandom Post liked Kanda and Allen's partnership, considering it to be the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. Additionally, Kanda's constant clashes with Allen were praised by Richard Osborn from IGN due to how comical they were, contrasting with the series' dark plot. Similarly, Sandra Scholes from Active Anime found Kanda and Allen to be not the standard anime variety , comparing them more to characters from fantasy stories. Since his appearance in the manga's second volume, Kanda has made minor appearances in the series. His return in the tenth volume was praised by Erkael, as well as his battle against the antagonist Noah Skin Bolic. The reviewers' comments were more positive regarding the next story arcs of the series. Erkael expressed surprise at how dark Kanda's past was, noting the impact it had on the character. Chris Beveridge, a reviewer from the Fandom Post, also enjoyed the flashbacks that detailed Kanda's past and said that it would be interesting to observe Kanda and Allen's relationship in future volumes. Anne Lauenroth from Anime News Network found Kanda's past as pitiful, since he is waiting for a love interest who might either be alive or dead. The reviewer also addressed how killing his only and best friend, Alma Karma, in order to continue living created the antisocial traits he displays in the series. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin enjoyed the fight between Kanda and Alma, but preferred the situation Allen was put into and said that he wanted to see more of that. Similarly, Chris Kirby enjoyed the duel's violence, but felt it was overshadowed by Allen's awakening as the 14th Noah, Nea. During the battle, it is revealed that the two fighters had been lovers Kanda stops fighting Alma and embraces him, giving him love earning praise by Lauenroth for showing a more mature side of the former. She also remarked how the scene helped to develop the character to the point that he calls Allen by his name for the first time instead of using nicknames, as he had done since they had met. Kanda's maturity, as reflected in his desire to become an Exorcist again for the sake of helping the missing Allen in the second anime's finale, also earned high praise from Lauenroth. Kirby agreed with her, noting how his return to the Black Order, despite his hatred towards it, helped to develop his character, commenting that previously, Kanda was not as engaging. In the next story arc, Douresseaux expected to see more of Kanda's dynamic with Johnny Gill as the two went in search of Allen. Some critics also commented on the character's voice actors. The first Japanese actor for Kanda, Takahiro Sakurai, was described by Lauenroth as having appropriate hate and arrogance , leading Lauenroth to be a fan of Kanda because of Sakurai. Morales criticized Kanda's English voice actor, Travis Willingham, as his portrayal of the cold and mysterious Kanda makes the young man sound more like a bodybuilder than a lithe swordsman . On the other hand, Michael Marr from Capsule Computers enjoyed Willingham's work, believing it was equal to Sakurai's. For the sequel, D.Gray man Hallow, Sakurai was replaced by Takuya Sato Lauenroth had mixed feelings about the new voice actor, describing Sato's performance as one of stoic indifference . Nevertheless, she praised both Sato and the actor voicing Kanda's younger self, Tsubasa Yonaga, for their roles in Hallow's seventh episode, due to how they portrayed Kanda's tragic backstory.

"Yu Narukami Japanese , Hepburn Narukami Yu is the protagonist of Atlus's 2008 role playing video game Persona 4. In the game, Yu is a silent character whose thoughts and actions are decided by the player. He is portrayed as a high school student who moves to Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin while his parents are busy working. Shortly after arriving to Inaba, Narukami starts investigating a murder case alongside his school mates and explores an alternate dimension where he obtains a power known as Persona to confront the Shadows , the creatures who murdered the first victims. Narukami has also appeared in other works related to Persona 4, including an anime adaptation called Persona 4 The Animation, a manga version, and several spin offs games. For these works, Narukami received his own characterization and development in the stories. He is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Narukami was designed by Shigenori Soejima who aimed to create an ambiguous character who could appeal to most players by way of reflecting several feelings towards them and through his mannerisms. For the anime, director Seiji Kishi expressed difficulties in giving the character emotions without damaging what the original staff created. Nevertheless, Narukami's characterization in the anime has been a subject of praise due to his portrayal as a mostly silent teenager whose few lines are related to the plot and in some cases, a source of comedy. Character designer Shigenori Soejima made Narukami with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Narukami to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Narukami to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him look cool. The collar of his school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted the main character needs to be well rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little something to make him stand out from the rest of the cast. He made a baby face sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's special something and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist. Yu's voice acting has been handled by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Bosch felt uneasy about voicing Yu due to the fact he also voiced another character from the game, Tohru Adachi. However, when he initially learned that the protagonist would have very few lines, his worry evaporated. It was first planned that Yu's voice actor for the anime would be recast, because he and Adachi would begin to interact several more times. However, in the end Bosch remained as the voice of Yu to avoid disappointing the game players. In order to solve the problem of having both of his characters sound too similar, he decided to speak in a lower register for Yu. In the initial Persona 4 game, the main player controlled character is known simply as the Protagonist or Hero , whose name is decided by the player. The name Yu Narukami was first given to the character in the 2011 anime adaptation, Persona 4 The Animation, and has since been used in official games where the character is unable to be named by the player, beginning with Persona 4 Arena. Prior to this, he was given the name of Soji Seta in the game's manga adaptation. In an interview, game director Katsura Hashino drew attention to the way in which the Protagonist remains silent and emotionless throughout the game. This leaves the player to interpret the Protagonist's emotional reactions subjectively at any particular point. Hashino elaborated on this particular character trait becoming an obstacle for Persona 4 The Animation's director Seiji Kishi, since the character would undoubtedly have to speak and show some level of emotion. In the same interview, Kishi admitted the difficulty of transitioning the silent Protagonist into the anime without destroying what Hashino had already established. A unique gesture of Yu's in the anime occurs when he unbuttons his school jacket when summoning a Persona for the first time. Kishi noted this as being a key moment of opening something that was closed. However, he refrained from explaining its deeper meaning, leaving it instead as something for the viewers to ponder and hence helping them enjoy the adaptation much more. Another aspect made possible in the anime was Yu's cool and composed nature during battle scenes. Hashino elaborated that it was possible to create such an attitude by having the fighting solely done by the Personas, thus establishing Yu as an emotionally strong charactersomething which would have lost its significance if he was given a weapon. In Persona 4, Yu Narukami is a high school student who moves to the countryside of Inaba to live with his uncle Ryotaro Dojima and cousin Nanako Dojima for a year as a result of his parents working abroad, and attends Yasogami High School where he meets most of the game's cast. Upon learning of the Midnight Channel's connection with the murders in Inaba, Yu gains access to the TV world, where he investigates the case alongside his friends and is appointed as their leader as a result of his experience. There he awakens his initial Persona, Izanagi , a swordsman wearing a black coat, which he uses to fight embodiements of humans' negative feelings, the Shadows. Yu also has the unique Wild Card , Wairudo ability, which allows him to swap Personas for use in battle. This is tied with the Social Links Community , Komyuniti in Japan mechanic each bond Yu makes with other characters grants him access to more and much stronger Personas, each named after one of the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck. Yu's own Arcana is The Fool, representing the group as a whole and personified by Izanagi, which later becomes the Judgement, when the Investigation Team realizes that Taro Namatame is not responsible for his actions and begin to seek out the real culprit behind the Inaba events This bond is represented by the Persona Lucifer , Rushifa in the anime . After closing the serial murder case, Yu learns he gained his powers from the goddess Izanami who had been posing as the Moel gas station attendant and aims to transform people into Shadows. Yu defeats Izanami by transforming Izanagi into Izanagi no Okami , Izanagi no Okami , representing The World, thanks to the power he gained from his many friends through Social Links. He then returns to his hometown, saying farewell to his friends. In the fighting game Persona 4 Arena, set two months after the events of Persona 4, Yu returns to Inaba for a holiday reunion, but must go to the TV World alongside his remaining friends to investigate a fighting tournament promoted in the Midnight Channel, while finding some of their missing friends and acquires help from their predecessors, Kirijo Group's Shadow Operatives. As the group is unable to find the mastermind behind the competition, the Investigation Team and Shadow Operatives decides to search for him behind his kidnapping Aigis' older sister android Labrys. He fights using Izanagi, though during its strongest attack it transforms in Izanagi no Okami. His moveset was balanced for the sequel to make him more versatile as a result of comments regarding his character being too strong in the first game. The author behind Arena's manga, Aiyakyuu, said that Yu was his favorite character and that whenever he draws him he thinks Yu is so cool Aiyakyuu also mentioned having trouble making the fight scene between Yu and Akihiko Sanada from Persona 3 as Both characters wouldn't easily lose to anyone. In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Yu reunites with both his friends and the Shadow Operatives to face a new threat of Shadows that appear in Inaba stealing powers from every Persona user and bring forth a second coming of Dark Hour. While Yu and his friends initially believe the culprit is a teenager with two split identities named Sho Minazuki, it is later revealed that the mastermind behind the fighting tournaments in the two Arena games is Kagutsuchi, a being that aims to destroy mankind. With help of his former enemy, Tohru Adachi, Yu manages to defeat Kagutsuchi, and helps Sho who now lost his other half of his personality, despite finally gaining the ability to summon his half's Persona, Tsukuyomi on how gain the trust of friendship through clashing their blades one last time before they depart in separate ways. Afterwards, Yu returns to his home and says goodbye to his friends. In the Persona 4 manga, he is named Soji Seta , Seta Soji and is depicted as a distant but otherwise friendly teenager due having to move frequently as a result of his parents' changing careers. He is also a supporting character in the manga Persona 4 The Magician with the name of Yu Narukami. In the events of The Animation, Yu faces his own Shadow that reveals his repressed fear of moving away from Inaba and losing his friends, a fact that Yu accepts and acknowledges as the truth, enabling him to best Margaret in combat so he can face Izanami's true form. He later appears in Persona 4 The Golden Animation, which focuses on new events not featured in the previous series, showcasing some slight differences in personality from that of the previous series. In the live stage production, he was portrayed by Toru Baba and his name was chosen by the audience. Yu appears alongside Persona 3's protagonist in the 2014 game, Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth, in which he joins forces with the cast of Persona 3 to escape the mysterious labyrinth that they have been trapped inside of, while at the same time working to restore the memories of the mysterious Zen and Rei. Yu also appears in the rhythm game, Persona 4 Dancing All Night, where his friend Rise Kujikawa asks for his help. Yu also appears in Square Enix's arcade card game Lord of Vermilion Re 2 as a summon spell. He also appears in the fighting game BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. He appears as a costume for the Mii characters in Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Yu also appears in the mobile game Star Ocean Anamnesis as part of a cross over with the Persona series. Yu appears as a DLC boss fight in Persona 5 Royal. Yu Narukami's character has generally been well received. His role has been noted for allowing the player to build a unique self during the game while questioning their real life identity. Additionally, the protagonist's relationships with his relatives with whom he starts living were praised for adding more variants to the relationships with these ones focusing on family relationships. Kotaku's Jason Schreier got to call him suave, handsome, and charming. He's friends with everyone, all the girls want to be with him, and in general he's just an all around badass. The character's role in the anime adaptation of Persona 4 earned similar response. A reviewer from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that Yu seems to be the aggregate of all the quirkiest possible choices you could make in the game, making him likable character for his diverse scenes. When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed to make up for it. In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his blank state to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable. Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a snarky, lovable main character who can keep a straight face while being kicked off a cliff. While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and spooky elements of the plot, Blu ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he remains something of a cipher throughout the series with the possibility of having the viewer relate with him. In contrast to most reviewers, Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku had mixed opinions about the character. Calling him one of the oddest characters in any work of fiction ever , Eisenbeis found that his lack of backstory made it difficult for the viewer to predict his actions. However, he noted that, as well as being entertaining to watch, by the series' end, Yu had become a character in his own right. However, he criticised Yu's characterization in Persona 4 Arena and its sequel for being a stereotypical lawful good hero and less than a bland compared to the new character Sho Minazuki and Rise's development. Additionally, he was rated sixth in the category Best Male Character from the Newtype anime awards from 2012.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu%20Narukami

"Yu Yu Hakusho Japanese , Hepburn Yu Yu Hakusho is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The series tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is struck and killed by a car while attempting to save a child's life. After a number of tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife Underworld, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of Underworld Detective , with which he must investigate various cases involving demons and apparitions in the human world. The manga becomes more focused on martial arts battles and tournaments as it progresses. Togashi began creating Yu Yu Hakusho around November 1990, basing the series on his interests in the occult and horror films and an influence of Buddhist mythology. The manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994. The series consists of 175 chapters collected in 19 tankobon volumes. In North America, the manga ran completely in Viz's Shonen Jump from January 2003 to January 2010. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The television series originally aired on Japan's Fuji TV network from October 10, 1992, to December 17, 1994. It was later licensed in North America by Funimation in 2001, where it aired on popular Cartoon Network blocks including Adult Swim and later Toonami. The television series has also been broadcast in various other countries around the world. The Yu Yu Hakusho franchise has spawned two animated films, a series of original video animations OVAs , audio albums, video games, and other merchandise. Yu Yu Hakusho has been well received, with the manga selling over 50 million copies in Japan alone and winning the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for shonen manga in 1993. The animated series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. Yu Yu Hakusho has been watched by a large audience in Japan and a wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, complimenting its writing, characters, and amount of action. Yu Yu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14 year old street brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way. His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the Underworld or Spirit World , Reikai where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of Underworld Detective , Reikai Tantei, lit. Spirit World Detective , charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World , Ningen Kai . Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons Hiei, Kurama and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun , a shot of aura or Reiki , Reiki, Spirit Energy fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane , Makai, lit. Demon World , a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the human world. Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. In order to test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament , Ankoku Bujutsukai, Dark Martial Arts Association , an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win in order to create a large hole from the human world to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process. After the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one by one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight. As they return to the human world, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every so often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world and is reunited with his friends. Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Showaru Cupid in Weekly Shonen Jump. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title How to be a Ghost while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed YuYu Ki Poltergeist Chronicles for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu Ki. Because a series with a similar name Chin Yu Ki had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative YuYu Hakusho Poltergeist Report . He commented that he could have used Den Legend or Monogatari Story , but Hakusho Report was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. Yusuke Urameshi is a pun, Kazuma Kuwabara is a combination of two professional baseball players, and Hiei and Kurama are just names that popped into Togashi's head . When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei. The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series Kinnikuman, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi's intention was to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous of him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle focused plot after about 30 chapters. Yu Yu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai human world , Reikai Underworld , and Makai Demon Plane as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the territory powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action whenever he desired such effects. During the years he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dojinshi Yoshirin de Pon that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The editors of the publication tried to make Togashi reconsider cancelling Yu Yu Hakusho, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself. The Yu Yu Hakusho manga series was written and drawn by Togashi and originally serialized by Shueisha in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994. The manga consists of 175 chapters spanning 19 tankobon with the first one being released on April 10, 1991, and the last one released on December 12, 1994. Between August 4, 2004, and March 4, 2005, Shueisha released the kanzenban complete editions of the manga. Each of the 15 kanzenban volumes features a new cover and more chapters than the tankobon edition. Yu Yu Hakusho has also been published as part of the Shueisha Jump Remix series of magazine style books. Nine volumes were released between December 22, 2008, and April 27, 2009. A bunkobon version began publication on November 18, 2010, and was finished on October 18, 2011. An English translation of the Yu Yu Hakusho manga was serialized in North America by Viz Media in the American Shonen Jump magazine, where it debuted in its inaugural January 2003 issue and ended in January 2010. Viz released all 19 collected volumes of the English manga between May 13, 2003, and March 2, 2010. A total of 176 chapters exist in this format due to Viz treating the extra non numbered chapter YuYu Hakusho Tales Two Shot found in volume seven which tells the story of how Hiei and Kurama first met as the 64th chapter. Viz later re released the series digitally as part of their digital manga releases between 20132014 and later added it to ComiXology's digital releases. The Yu Yu Hakusho manga has additionally been licensed and published across Asia and Europe. A French translation from Kana, for example, began publication in 1997. The Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The series, consisting of 112 episodes, aired from October 10, 1992, to January 7, 1995, on Fuji Television. The episodes were released on 23 video cassettes by Pony Canyon from January 1, 1995, to December 6, 1995. They were also released on 28 DVD volumes by Beam Entertainment, with volumes 814 being released on March 25, 2002, volumes 1521 being released on April 25, 2002, and volumes 2228 being released on May 25, 2002. The anime differed from its manga source material by containing different levels of violence and profanity, as well as minor variations in art style from one to the other. In early 2001, the series was acquired by Funimation Entertainment for North American distribution as Yu Yu Hakusho Ghost Files. Funimation's production saw a significant contribution from voice actor Justin Cook, who not only directed the dub but also voiced the protagonist Yusuke. The American produced English dubbed episodes aired from February 23, 2002, to April 1, 2006 on Cartoon Network. Initially, the series was shown on the channel's Adult Swim programming block from February 2002 to April 2003, but was later moved to Toonami. Some of the show's original depictions of mature content including violence, sexual humor, and coarse language, as well as some controversial cultural discrepancies were edited out for broadcast. Yu Yu Hakusho was taken off Toonami around March 2005 and moved to an early Saturday morning time slot that October where the series finished its run. It was also aired uncut as part of the Funimation programming block on Colours TV in 2006 and the Funimation Channel in high definition in 2011. The series was distributed in the United Kingdom by MVM Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. In India the English language version of the series was released as Ghost Fighter. Yu Yu Hakusho was localized in the Philippines as Ghost Fighter and aired on IBC in the mid 1990s, as well as on GMA Network in 1999. This version of the dub localized the characters' names, such as changing Yusuke to Eugene . Funimation separated the series into four seasons , that each compose their own story arc, which they refer to as sagas . In North America, 32 DVD compilations have been released by Funimation for the four sagas, with the first released on April 16, 2002, and the last on July 19, 2005. The episodes have been released in both edited and uncut formats.

In Japan, three separate multidisc DVD box sets were released, as well as 28 DVDs totaling all 112 episodes of the series. Japanese home video distributor Bandai Visual began releasing the series on Blu ray Disc on October 27, 2009, with the first set containing a picture drama set after the end of the series that saw cast members reunite to record new dialogue. Two animated films based on Yu Yu Hakusho have been produced. Both films have original storyline content that is not canonical to the manga. The first, simply titled Yu Yu Hakusho was released in Japan on July 10, 1993, as part of a seasonal film festival. In the movie, the protagonists Yusuke and Kuwabara are on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Koenma from a pair of demons who desire the Golden Seal, a stamp used for finalizing the sentencing of souls in the afterlife. AnimeWorks released an English dubbed version of the half hour film on VHS in both English dubbed and subtitled formats on May 5, 1998, and on DVD on January 30, 2001.

Funimation dubbed the OVAs though not the anime montages and re dubbed the first theatrical film with their original cast from the anime, and released them both in North America in a two disc DVD bundle titled Yu Yu Hakusho The Movie Eizou Hakusho on December 13, 2011. This version splits up parts of the OVAs and does not include the Japanese voice actor interviews. A brand new OVA of Yu Yu Hakusho was released with a Blu ray box set of the series on October 26, 2018, in Japan. It adapts the Two Shot bonus chapter from the manga's seventh volume and the manga's penultimate chapter All or Nothing . In October 2019, Funimation announced the OVA release with an English dub. The music for the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation was composed by Yusuke Honma. The series has one opening theme, Hohoemi no Bakudan , Hohoemi no Bakudan, lit.

Two drama albums have been released by Shueisha, the first of which has an audio adaptation of the chapter Yu Yu Hakusho Tales Two Shot . A CD soundtrack for the second film and a maxi single with the vocal songs of Mawatari and Takahashi have also been published. A number of video games have been developed that tie to the Yu Yu Hakusho series, most of which have been produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only saw three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, Yu Yu Hakusho Makyo Toitsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho Sunset Fighters. When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions Yu Yu Hakusho Spirit Detective, an action adventure game for the Game Boy Advance Yu Yu Hakusho Tournament Tactics, a tactical role playing game also for the Game Boy Advance and Yu Yu Hakusho Dark Tournament, a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2. An encyclopedia titled Official Yu Yu Hakusho Who's Who Underworld Character Book , Yu Yu Hakusho Koushiki Kyarakutazubukku Reikai Shinshiroku was published by Shueisha on March 4, 2005. It contains extensive character profiles, story summaries, and an exclusive interview with Yoshihiro Togashi. An art book, Yu Yu Hakusho Illustrations , Yu Yu Hakusho Gashu , was published by Shueisha on April 27, 2005. It is composed of pieces of artwork from the series, including illustrations created for the kanzenban edition reprints and an index of print material where each image was first used. Shueisha has also released two volumes of a guide book titled Yu Yu Hakusho Perfect File , Yu Yu Hakusho Pafekutofairu and books based on both films, each containing screenshots organized in manga style panels. In Japan, various collectables such as trading figures, plush dolls, and gashapon toys also exist. A collectable card game based on the franchise was released by Movic. In North America, the series saw licensing for apparel from ODM, lines of action figures by IF Labs and Jakks Pacific, a Skannerz electronic toy from Radica Games, and an activities book from Scholastic. Score Entertainment created the Yu Yu Hakusho Trading Card Game for release in the United States. An English guidebook to the series titled Yu Yu Hakusho Uncovered The Unofficial Guide was published by Cocoro Books on October 12, 2004. In September 2019 Yu Yu Hakusho joined the Universal Fighting System CCG, this marked the second anime license to make it into the system. Yu Yu Hakusho has sold more than 50 million copies in Japan alone, making it one of Weekly Shonen Jump's best selling manga series. Patricia Duffield, a columnist for Animerica Extra, acknowledged the manga as one of the kings of popularity in the mid 1990s in the region where it saw mass availability from large bookstore chains to small train station kiosks. Yu Yu Hakusho earned Yoshihiro Togashi the Shogakukan Manga Award for shonen in 1993. Towards the end of the series' run, Togashi was publicly criticized for not meeting chapter deadlines and for lower quality art. In North America, several volumes of the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, including volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005. In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication out of 120,000 were returned from the fairs as a result of the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist manji. The Yu Yu Hakusho manga publication has received mixed criticism by reviewers in English speaking regions. Martin Ouellette of the Canadian Protoculture Addicts compared the progression of the series to Dragon Ball Z and stated, Togashi's art, while simple, is extremely efficient and the story is really fun. An older article by the same reviewer disagreed with the notion that Yu Yu Hakusho was similar to Dragon Ball, stating that the former franchise has better developed characters, more interesting action sequences, and more humor. Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania.com enjoyed the manga's artwork and found that the supporting characters tend to be illustrated with more detail than the main characters. He praised Lillian Olsen's English translation, but disliked Viz's use of overlaying English words to translate the expression of sound effects. In later volumes Chavez was dismayed by the transition of the manga from the early detective cases to the Dark Tournament arc. He asserted, Seeing fight, after fight, after fight gets boring and this seriously is only the start of this trend. Dan Polley, a staff reviewer of Manga Life, gave an average grade to the fifth volume, which entails Yusuke's battle with Suzaku, the leader of the Four Beasts. Although he found some the battle sequences to be engaging, Polley judged the chapters as lacking in characterization and development overall. Polley also discounted the manga's comedy, considering the bit gags or fairly lame jokes to be too much at times. The Yu Yu Hakusho television series was voted the best anime of the year in the 1994 and 1995 Animage Anime Grand Prix and the second best in 1993 after Sailor Moon. Additionally, the publication declared the series number 53 on its top 100 anime listing in 2001. In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, Yu Yu Hakusho was voted as the 15th best anime of all time. The Japanese magazine Brutus voted it the sixth best anime of all time. The hit show garnered a large number of viewers during its run in Japan. Funimation president Gen Fukunaga remarked that Yu Yu Hakusho came 'out of nowhere' to surprise people with huge ratings , which were just below those achieved by the popular series Dragon Ball Z. Yu Yu Hakusho was frequently watched by several age groups during its early run in North America. When it aired on Adult Swim, the anime, along with others such as Inuyasha and Cowboy Bebop, met with male audiences ages 1834. During its Toonami debut in May 2003, Yu Yu Hakusho placed in seven out of the top 111 Nielsen ratings for Cartoon Network telecasts, with the highest being number 30 on May 13 at a two percent share of all viewing televisions in the country. Atari stated in December 2003 that the anime was one of the top rated television programs in North America for males ages 914. Nielsen additionally reported that Yu Yu Hakusho tied with Dragon Ball GT as the top rated Cartoon Network program for the same demographic during the week of September 28, 2004. It was the second highest rated show among ages 1217 the same week. Cartoon Network dropped the show from Toonami in March 2005 due to declining ratings. Yu Yu Hakusho proved to be popular in the Philippines, where it was rerun several times and managed to draw more viewers in the prime time slot than both local and foreign soap operas. The animated series received a generally positive reception in North America. In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho was named the second best action adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as one of the best action series out there , and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, and a lot of action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance. He recommended the first three season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode. Jeffrey Harris of IGN was more critical when looking at later episodes, and felt that the end of the show's third arc involving the villain Sensui is too similar to the finale of the second arc with Toguro. He described the episodes as trying too hard to draw sympathy from the audience for anime's villains. Despite his overall praise of Yu Yu Hakusho, Divers noted in a review about one DVD release that the show that fine line of a solid long running series or being a broken record . He also called the artwork of the first few episodes dated and pointed out questionable script choices regarding the English dub. Former",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu%20Yu%20Hakusho
"Yu Yu Hakusho Makyo Toitsusen Yu Yu Hakusho Battle To Unite The Demon Plane is a 1994 fighting game developed by Treasure and published by Sega for the Mega Drive. It is based on the manga series Yu Yu Hakusho by Yoshihiro Togashi. The plot follows the protagonist Yusuke Urameshi, who is tasked by the ruler of the afterlife with solving detective style cases involving both humans and demons threatening the living world. The story begins to focus heavily on martial arts battles as it progresses. The game features 11 playable characters from the manga and traditional 2D fighting gameplay. Opponents compete in rounds, attempting to deplete each other's health by utilizing short and long range attacks and special combos. It also integrates other mechanics, such as allowing up to four players to compete simultaneously and letting fighters alternate between horizontal planes in the foreground and background. A number of multiplayer options are available that include battle royales, tag team matches, and tournament modes. Makyo Toitsusen was produced at the height of a global fighting game boom for home consoles in the early 1990s, brought on by hits like Street Fighter II. After the company made its debut on the system with Gunstar Heroes, Treasure began development on Makyo Toitsusen as one of a quartet of Mega Drive games to be published by Sega. Unlike the rest of these titles, Makyo Toitsusen was never localized in North America or Europe. The game's only other official release was in Brazil via Tectoy in 1999 where it was titled Yu Yu Hakusho Sunset Fighters. Despite its limited availability, the game has been assessed by several English language publications and enjoyed a mostly positive response from critics. The gameplay and four player options were praised by many reviewers, several of which have even considered it among the best fighting games of the 16 bit generation, although its graphics and sound received criticism. Yu Yu Hakusho Makyo Toitsusen is fighting game based on the supernatural manga series Yu Yu Hakusho, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The manga follows protagonist Yusuke Urameshi, a juvenile delinquent who sacrifices his life to save a child and is resurrected by the ruler of the afterlife in order to solve detective style cases involving humans and demons threatening the living world. The plot puts a heavy emphasis on martial arts battles as it progresses. Makyo Toitsusen allows the player to choose one of 11 key characters from the manga. It has no story mode, does not adapt or tie into the plot of its source material, and features few appearances from the supporting cast. The game adopts a versus fighting game template made popular by the Street Fighter series where the objective of each match is for the player or players to eliminate opponents by depleting their health gauges using various short and long ranged attacks. Fighters move horizontally on 2D battlefields and can jump from the ground toward or over opponents. One on one matches are possible, but Makyo Toitsusen allows up to four characters to battle simultaneously in a single match. This added action is complimented by the inclusion of a second layer in each stage. Similar to the Fatal Fury series, players can leap onto a separate horizontal plane in the background. Matches have no time limit. Since multiple opponents can potentially face either in front of or behind the player, pushing back on the controller's directional pad will cause a character to face the opposite direction rather than simply back away or block enemy attacks. Makyo Toitsusen is compatible with both the Mega Drive's three button and six button gamepads. The three button controller's A , B , and C face buttons can be mapped to light attack, heavy attack, and guard, while movement actions like dashing forward, dashing backward, and shifting planes are performed using basic combinations of the directional pad and face buttons. The additional X , Y , and Z inputs on the six button controller allow for mapping these six actions to one face button each. All characters can use combos and unique special attacks that may be performed either on the ground or in the air, some of which can be charged for larger amounts of damage. Since the three button controller is standard and pushing the back button changes a character's direction, combos are fairly simple to execute. A few abilities require spirit energy that is represented by a second gauge under a fighter's health and can be refilled by holding down an attack button. A charged attack can be temporarily cancelled and stored by pushing back on the directional pad and then instantly unleashed at that strength the next time the player uses it. The game offers several modes that consist of a single player campaign for fighting consecutive one on one matches an endless practice mode and multiplayer options further divided into four participant battle royales and tag team matches with opposing teams of two. A bracketed tournament mode can also be chosen where individual players, teams of players, and the computer can battle until a final championship match. Up to four human players can participate in these multiplayer modes using Sega's Team Player multitap device. Yu Yu Hakusho Makyo Toitsusen was developed by Treasure and was produced in association with Yu Yu Hakusho author Yoshihiro Togashi, the manga's publisher Shueisha, the anime adaptation's Studio Pierrot, and its television broadcaster Fuji TV. The home console market of the early 1990s was in the midst of a fighting game craze thanks to hits such as Street Fighter II. The simultaneous popularity of Yu Yu Hakusho in Japan led to games in this genre showing up on several home and handheld gaming platforms. After Treasure's debut on the Mega Drive with Gunstar Heroes, Makyo Toitsusen was one of four games in simultaneous development by the company for the system with Sega as publisher. Makyo Toitsusen is Treasure's first fighting game and its second game based on a licensed property, after McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure. The project was supervised by Treasure founder and president Masato Maegawa. Sega assigned Yoichi Shimosato to support the game's production after he joined the company's Third Consumer Research Division in 1993. Despite the developer's seemingly close relationship with Sega, Maegawa claimed the publisher's communication was poor and that it offered no help to Treasure during the game's creation. Treasure's staff was made up chiefly of programmers Masaki Ukyo and Mitsuru Yaida graphics artists Makoto Ogino and Hiroshi Iuchi director and graphics designer Tetsuhiko Kikuchi and lead sound effects and music composer Satoshi Murata. Alongside Katsuhiko Suzuki, Aki Hata, and Norio Hanzawa, Murata composed original music tracks for the game while also providing instrumental versions of the songs Hohoemi no Bakudan and Unbalance na Kiss o Shite from the Yu Yu Hakusho anime. The game's main theme, Tokenai Hono , Insoluble Flame , was written and arranged by Hata, who also performed a vocal version of the song for its official soundtrack CD and later one of her own albums. The game also features an extensive array of digitized character voice samples portrayed the anime's voice cast. Makyo Toitsusen was released in Japan on September 30, 1994. The Mega Drive was less commercially successful in Japan than it was overseas and because Treasure maintained profits by shipping small numbers of its products, few units of the game went to retail. Maegawa insisted that Treasure always developed games with foreign markets in mind. Despite these factors, Makyo Toitsusen was never officially localized in North America or Europe, perhaps due to the Yu Yu Hakusho franchise being relatively unknown in those regions during the Mega Drive's lifespan. It remains the only Mega Drive game by Treasure not to see a release in these territories. Notably, the game was licensed by Tectoy, translated into Portuguese, and released in Brazil in 1999 as Yu Yu Hakusho Sunset Fighters. A Portuguese dub of the anime had already begun airing in South America, while the Mega Drive maintained a strong presence in Brazil throughout the decade largely due to a distribution partnership between Tectoy and Sega. Other than the text, the two versions of Makyo Toitsusen are nearly identical. The Portuguese translation is mostly faithful to the original Japanese text, though some character names were altered. Like the Japanese edition, very few copies were shipped. Makyo Toitsusen had not seen a digital re release, likely due to licensing issues, until its inclusion on the Japanese version of the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019. Upon its release, Yu Yu Hakusho Makyo Toitsusen was given average review scores from panels in major Japanese magazines like Famitsu and Beep MegaDrive. Although it never had an official localization in any region other than South America, it was imported by print and online publications in North America and Europe and met with greater acclaim there. Nick Des Barres of GameFan, Tom Stratton of Gamer's Republic, and the editors of Retro Gamer have all heaped praise on the game. Des Barres called it the best 16 bit fighting game ever in a 1994 review and concluded that Yu Yu Hakusho is a game that truly has to be seen to be believed. Stratton likewise described it in 1999 as easily one of the best 16 bit fighters there has ever been. Retro Gamer has repeatedly lauded the game, describing it as possibly the best Yu Yu Hakusho game and among the best Mega Drive games and fighting games of the 16 bit era. Kurt Kulata of Hardcore Gaming 101 said, It manages to be one of the best anime license games ever produced, and stand toe to toe with the most legendary of tournament fighting games. The gameplay and multiplayer options were high points for many reviewers. Retro Gamer summarized Makyo Toitsusen as highly enjoyable in single player as an over the top and zany anime styled brawler, it's unstoppable in four player mode and one the best multiplayer experiences available on the system. Stratton, Kulata, and Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM all found the gameplay to be well balanced. Stratton used the game's dual layer stages as an example of how this balance was accomplished, explaining that players could tactically parry enemies by switching planes or charge an attack to meet an opponent jumping into their plane. Kulata similarly credited the plane shifting mechanic for allowing an equal emphasis on player defense and offense and noted that projectile attacks are made less powerful than standard punches and kicks, as opposed to its fighting genre contemporaries. Mean Machines Sega writers Gus Swan and Steve Merrett and Anime News Network contributor Todd Ciolek were all pleased with the variety of extra game modes. However, Swan and Merrett were more critical of the gameplay overall, pointing to a sluggish pace and simple minded computer AI. The duo stated that the game paled in comparison to Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat II, both of which were more accessible to Western gamers in 1994. EGM admitted to having difficulty keeping up with the action with multiple characters in a single battle. Reception for the graphics and sound of Makyo Toitsusen has been mixed. Des Barres, Stratton, Kulata, and Retro Gamer all had positive comments regarding its visuals and audio. Retro Gamer felt the game boasted slick animations and detailed character sprites, while both Des Barres and Stratton thought the characters properly mimicked their anime counterparts. Kulata was especially impressed with the backgrounds, which utilize various effects such as parallax, transparencies, and warping. Des Barres and Retro Gamer enjoyed the music, the former proclaiming it to be the best Mega Drive music he had ever heard. Kulata made similar, constructive remarks about its voice samples and sound effects, but considered the soundtrack to be forgettable in contrast to other Mega Drive games by Treasure. Ciolek opined that Treasure focused too much on refining the gameplay and failed to fully develop its presentation. He criticized it for having small character sprites, a bland soundtrack, scratchy voice overs, and dynamic backgrounds that try to compensate for frequently boring scenery with changes in lighting. Swan and Merrett were complimentary of the sprite animation and voice sample quality, but echoed complaints that the backgrounds lacked detail and coloring and that the soundtrack was not up to the standard of Treasure's other in game music. Retro Gamer agreed that the backgrounds were drab and unfinished when compared to the rest of the game's aesthetic. EGM seconded the notion that the sprites were too small while also experiencing break up when too many present were on screen at once. Treasure's next fighting game, Guardian Heroes, was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. This game features 2D sprites and gameplay mechanics resembling Makyo Toitsusen like simplified combos and multiple horizontal planes in battle. For Guardian Heroes, Treasure president Masato Maegawa told gamesTM that the developer wanted to evolve what they had created in Makyo Toitsusen into an original game with more madness and excess. Treasure also carried this design over into two Nintendo DS fighting games that are based on the manga series Bleach. This includes supporting up to four players simultaneously and having two horizontal planes between which players can switch during fights.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu%20Yu%20Hakusho%20Maky%C5%8D%20T%C5%8Ditsusen
"Yucamane, Yucamani or Yucumane is an andesitic stratovolcano in the Tacna Region of southern Peru. It is part of the Peruvian segment of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the three volcanic belts of the Andes generated by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate. Peru's active volcanoes Ubinas, Sabancaya and El Misti are also part of the Central Volcanic Zone. Yucamane, together with the volcanoes Yucamane Chico and Calientes farther north, forms a Pleistocene volcanic group. Yucamane is constructed mainly by lava flows with subordinate pyroclastic deposits, and it has a well preserved summit crater with fumarolic activity. The volcanic group was active in the Pleistocene epoch, with several explosive eruptions occurring during the Holocene epoch at Yucamane proper. The last dated eruption of Yucamane occurred 1,320 BCE whether there were historical eruptions is unclear as some eruptions attributed to Yucamane probably took place at Tutupaca. Yucamane lies in the Tacna Region, Candarave Province, Candarave District of Peru, west of lake Vilacota. The town of Candarave lies 11 kilometres 6.8 mi southwest from the volcano and the city of Tacna 90 kilometres 56 mi south. A number of mostly agricultural towns exist on its slopes, such as Aricota, Cairani, Camilaca, Cucachi, Huanuara, Morjani, Pallata, Susapaya, Tarata, Ticaco, Totora and Yucamane Pampa, as well as irrigation infrastructure and major roads. Sulfur was mined on the volcano in the past. The area of Yucamane is accessible by a number of roads including the international Ilo Desaguadero highway, and a road leads up the northwestern flank of Yucamane to a point close to the mountain pass between Yucamane and Calientes. The edifice of the volcano and surrounding region are part of the Vilacota Maure protected area. The Andes are the longest mountain range on Earth, extending 9,000 kilometres 5,600 mi from the Tierra del Fuego archipelago in southernmost South America to Venezuela in the north. In southern Peru, the Andes consist of several mountain chains including the Western Cordillera and the Eastern Cordillera, with elevations of up to 4,0005,000 metres 13,00016,000 ft , which are separated from each other by the Altiplano. More than 2,000 volcanoes exist in the Andes, mainly in the countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Among these is Nevado del Ruiz, which erupted in 1985 in Colombia. Seven volcanoes have been active in Peru since the arrival of the Spaniards, but volcanic activity is typically poorly recorded in Peru, owing to the remote nature of the region and the scarce population. Yucamane is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the three major volcanic belts in the Andes, which spans the countries of Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. In Peru about four hundred heavily eroded volcanoes make up the volcanically active area along with the active volcanoes El Misti, Sabancaya and Ubinas the volcanoes Andagua volcanic field, Casiri, Chachani, Coropuna, Firura, Huaynaputina, Tutupaca and Yucamane may have been active in recent history. The largest historical eruption in Peru occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina and caused 1,500 fatalities and severe economic damage. Another major eruption occurred 2,000 years before present at El Misti volcano. Finally, the three volcanoes Ampato, Chachani and Coropuna have heights exceeding 6,000 metres 20,000 ft . Yucamane is a mountain whose height is variously given as 5,495 metre 18,028 ft , 5,500 metre 18,000 ft or 5,508 metre 18,071 ft . It is a high compound volcano, with an about 800 metre 2,600 ft wide summit crater this depression in turn has a smaller crater with a diameter of 300 metres 980 ft nested within. The summit crater has a young appearance, and due to the youth of the volcano there is little trace of glaciation. Yucamane has a conical shape and is formed primarily by lava flows with some block and ash flows and pyroclastic flows. Lava flows are 2050 metres 66164 ft thick and often show characteristic flow ridges. They are especially prevalent on the upper western and upper southern flanks of the volcano, while the eastern flank has a higher proportion of pyroclastic flows, as does the far southern flank. Based on slope angle, a Yucamane I volcano, which forms the lower part of the volcano and has a more gentle slope, has been distinguished from a Yucamane II , which sits atop Yucamane I and has steeper slopes. On the southeastern flank a secondary volcanic centre, 4,200 metre 13,800 ft high Mal Paso, can be found. This cone is 1.5 kilometres 0.93 mi wide and has a partially destroyed crater. Several other volcanoes lie north of Yucamane, such as the 5,310 metre 17,420 ft or 5,355 metre 17,569 ft high Yucamane Chico and the 5,358 metre 17,579 ft or 5,368 metre 17,612 ft high Calientes, which form a 11 kilometre 6.8 mi long north south volcanic chain with Yucamane. Other volcanoes in the area include San Pedro and the much older Nazaparco. Nazaparco consists of andesitic rocks and rhyolitic block and ash flows, while Yucamane Chico and Calientes are surrounded by radially extending lava flows like Yucamane proper. Calientes have a degraded summit crater. These older volcanoes are eroded and show evidence of sector collapses and glaciation, which has left moraines at elevations of about 4,300 metres 14,100 ft . This volcanic complex is part of the Cordillera del Barroso mountain chain in southern Peru. The Yucamane fault runs in a north south direction across the volcanoes, and another fault that runs northwest southeast is named the Yucamane Chico fault the Yucamane Chico volcano roughly coincides with the intersection of these faults. The slopes of the volcano drain westward, eastward and southward towards the Calientes and Callazas rivers in the east and west of Yucamane, respectively. Both rivers flow southward and ultimately join to form the Locumba river, which ends in the Pacific Ocean. The water in these rivers contains large quantities of arsenic derived from volcanic rocks, including Yucamane's volcanic rocks arsenic in drinking water is linked to internal organ damage and cancer. Off the western coast of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a rate of about 4.6 centimetres per year 1.8 in year . This subduction process is responsible for the volcanic activity in the Andes. The subducting slab releases fluids which induce the formation of melts which are then erupted on the surface as volcanism. The subduction process is not uniform along the plate margin variations in the dip of the subducting Nazca plate occur along its length, and volcanic activity is concentrated in three belts Northern Volcanic Zone, Central Volcanic Zone and Southern Volcanic Zone where the angle of subduction is steep enough. Volcanism in the region has been active since the Jurassic, with remnants of the oldest volcanic arc recognizable in the Peruvian Coastal Cordillera. During the Miocene epoch, volcanic activity occurred along the entire length of Peru Pliocene Pleistocene activity on the other hand is confined to southern Peru as part of the Central Volcanic Zone, with volcanic centres concentrated in the Western Cordillera. Volcanoes in Peru were first catalogued in 1962 and 1966, with a major compilation being published in 1991 by De Silva and Francis. These volcanoes include composite volcanoes, ignimbrites, lava domes and lava flow fields. Yucamane is constructed on a basement formed by the Paleozoic Tacaza Group lavas of the lower Tacaza formation , the Jurassic Yura Group sediments of the Hualhuani formation and the Neogene volcanic Huaylillas formation parts of this basement crop out on the southern side of Yucamane. This basement in turn consists of two major tectonic blocks, the southern Arequipa terrane and the northern Paracas massif both are formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and are covered by Mesozoic sedimentary and Cenozoic volcanic rocks. Yucamane has erupted andesite, basaltic andesite, trachyandesite and dacite, which define a potassium rich calc alkaline suite. The andesites make up the bulk of the outcropping edifice. These andesitic rocks contain phenocrysts of amphibole, biotite, hornblende, oxides, plagioclase and quartz. The region has a dry tropical climate, with precipitation on Yucamane amounting to about 200180 millimetres per year 7.97.1 in year . Most of it falls during the summer months, and the amount of precipitation decreases southwestward towards the coast and away from the mountains. After precipitation events the mountain is sometimes covered with snow. Average temperatures in the region vary between 2.316.5 C 36.161.7 F throughout the year. Vegetation around the volcano includes a humid tundra with overall low vegetation density on its upper slopes, and paramo and montane steppe vegetation east west and south of the volcano on its lower slopes, respectively. Quenoa woods have been observed on its flanks, which are otherwise covered by pastures lower on the volcano. The scorpion species Brachistosternus ninapo is named after the volcano the term ninapo is a portmanteau of the Quechua word for fire spitting mountain . This scorpion was discovered on the sides of the volcanoes Yucamane and El Misti. Yucamane Chico and Calientes are of possibly pre Pleistocene epoch age while Yucamane is younger. The activity of Calientes and Yucamane, however, overlapped in time, and both have generated lava flows which lie above moraines. Nazaparco was dated to 6.23 0.1 million years ago, while dates of 540,000 270,000 and 126,000 3,000 before present on an older stage are reported for Caliente. Yucamane itself has lava flows dated at 380,000 300,000, 23,000 1,000 and 3,000 2,000 years before present. Tephrochronology has shown the occurrence of an eruption 44,000 2,130 2,910 years ago another one occurred 36,450 250 years ago and generated a lateral blast. Yet another event occurred 3,270 50 3,085 35 years before present during the course of this eruption Yucamane expelled at least 7,000,000 cubic metres 250,000,000 cu ft of material in the form of pumice, lapilli and tephra. This eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 5 fallout deposits reached the Quelccaya Ice Cap and influenced the chemistry of lakes close to the ice cap. Activity during the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs was mainly explosive with Vulcanian eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions among others, which generated volcanic ash falls, block and ash flows, pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic surges. In total, about 4 5 explosive eruptions occurred in post glacial time and left tephra deposits over the southern and southeastern flanks of the edifice. Eruptions reported in 1787, 1802, 1862 and 1902 in the region have also been attributed to Yucamane, although some may actually have occurred at Tutupaca. The 1787 and 1902 events involved the emission of ash an 1874 edition of the Arequipa based El Deber newspaper states that Yucamane was bursting and steaming in 1787. There does not appear to be any volcanic material more recent than the 3,270 50 3,085 35 eruption, however. Overall, historical records are fragmentary and scarce, and the Global Volcanism Program recognizes the 1,320 BCE eruption as the most recent event. Yucamane is fumarolically active in its summit crater, the fumaroles are most recognizable after precipitation and are not very intense. Presently, Yucamane is considered to be a dormant volcano. Thermal anomalies of about 3 C 5.4 F of uncertain origin have been observed on Yucamane by satellite imagery. The Caliente geothermal field east of Yucamane, which includes geysers and hot springs, appears to be unrelated to Yucamane. The Peruvian geological agency INGEMMET has published ash fall, lava flow and pyroclastic flow hazard maps for Yucamane, and additional hazard maps are available on its website. According to these the western, eastern and southern flanks could be threatened by lava flows, whereas the older volcanoes protect much of the northern flank. Hazards from pyroclastic flows extend farther, down to the Laguna Aricota lake southwest of the volcano. Hazards from lava flows derive from their ability to bury land and to ignite flammable materials, as well as the possible creation of lava dams on rivers and outburst floods when they break, while the high speed and temperatures of pyroclastic flows threatens people with asphyxiation, burial and burns. More than 9,000 people live in the danger zone. Ash fall from an eruption could extend southeastward to the border with Chile and affect the towns of Candarave, Ilabaya, Pachia, Palca and Tarata. Volcanic earthquakes like the 1999 Ticsani earthquakes at a volcano farther north and volcanic gases constitute additional dangers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucamane
"The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, as designated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1987, is to be a deep geological repository storage facility within Yucca Mountain for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste in the United States. The site is located on federal land adjacent to the Nevada Test Site in Nye County, Nevada, about 80 mi 130 km northwest of the Las Vegas Valley. The project was approved in 2002 by the 107th United States Congress, but federal funding for the site ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via amendment to the Department of Defense and Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011 by the Republican controlled house of Representatives. The project has encountered many difficulties and was highly contested by the non local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians. The project also faces strong state and regional opposition. The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons. This leaves American utilities and the United States government, which currently disposes of its transuranic waste 2,150 feet 660 m below the surface at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, without any designated long term storage site for the high level radioactive waste stored on site at various nuclear facilities around the country. Under President Barack Obama the Department of Energy DOE was reviewing options other than Yucca Mountain for a high level waste repository. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It detailed an urgent need to find a site suitable for constructing a consolidated, geological repository, stating that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with direct access to the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as the Cabinet level Department of Energy is. Under President Donald Trump, the DOE has ceased deep borehole and other nonYucca Mountain waste disposition research activities. For FY18, the DOE had requested 120 million and the NRC 30 million from Congress to continue licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain Repository. For FY19, the DOE has again requested 120 million but the NRC has increased its request to 47.7 million. Congress decided to provide no funding for the remainder of FY18. In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks. Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and high level radioactive waste is the by product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy to solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground. The DOE began studying Yucca Mountain in 1978 to determine whether it would be suitable for the nation's first long term geologic repository for over 70,000 metric tons 69,000 long tons 77,000 short tons 150 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste as of 2015 when stored at 121 sites around the nation. An estimated 10,000 metric tons 9,800 long tons 11,000 short tons of the waste would be from America's military nuclear programs. On December 19, 1984, the DOE selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites, based on data collected for nearly ten years. The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985. Based on these reports, President Ronald Reagan approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization. The three sites were Hanford, Washington Deaf Smith County, Texas and Yucca Mountain. In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain, which is located adjacent to the former nuclear test site. The Act provided that if during site characterization the Yucca Mountain location was found unsuitable, studies would be stopped immediately. This option expired when the site was actually recommended by the President. On July 23, 2002, President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87, Pub.L. 107200 allowing the DOE to take the next step in establishing a safe repository in which to store the country's nuclear waste. The DOE was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain Repository by January 31, 1998 but did not do so because of a series of delays due to legal challenges, concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility, and political pressures resulting in underfunding of the construction. On July 18, 2006 the DOE proposed March 31, 2017 as the date to open the facility and begin accepting waste based on full funding. On September 8, 2006 Ward Edward Sproat, a nuclear industry executive formerly of PECO energy in Pennsylvania, was nominated by President Bush to lead the Yucca Mountain Project. Following the 2006 mid term Congressional elections, Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid, a longtime opponent of the repository, became the Senate Majority Leader, putting him in a position to greatly affect the future of the project. Reid has said that he would continue to work to block completion of the project, and is quoted as having said Yucca Mountain is dead. It'll never happen. In the 2008 Omnibus Spending Bill, the Yucca Mountain Project's budget was reduced to 390 million. The project was able to reallocate resources and delay transportation expenditures to complete the License Application for submission on June 3, 2008. During his 2008 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama promised to abandon the Yucca Mountain project. As a result, Senator Reid moved the Nevada primary to help President Obama's campaign. After his election, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told President Obama he did not have the ability to do so. On April 23, 2009, Lindsey Graham R South Carolina and eight other senators introduced legislation to provide rebates from a 30 billion federally managed fund into which nuclear power plants had been paying, so as to refund all collected funds if the project was in fact cancelled by Congress. In November 2013, in response to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute, the US court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which designates Yucca Mountain as the repository, or Congress changes the law. The fee ended May 16, 2014. Lacking an operating repository, the federal government initially paid utility companies somewhere between 300 and 500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998. For the ten years after 2015 it is estimated to cost taxpayers 24 billion in payments from the Judgment Fund. The Judgment Fund is not subject to budget rules and allows Congress to ignore the nuclear waste issue since payments therefrom do not have any impact on yearly spending for other programs. The purpose of the Yucca Mountain project is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and develop a national site for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste storage. The management and operating contractor as of April 1, 2009 for the project is USA Repository Services USA RS , a wholly owned subsidiary of URS Corporation now part of AECOM with supporting principal subcontractors Shaw Corporation now part of McDermott International Inc. and Areva Federal Services LLC now Orano federal services business . After the layoff of 800 employees on March 31, 2009, about 100 employees remained on the project until all technical staff were laid off by the end of FY 2010 due to zero funding in the 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Sandia National Laboratories had the responsibility for post closure analysis and ensuring compliance with the NWPA. The main tunnel of the Exploratory Studies Facility is U shaped, 5 mi 8.0 km long and 25 ft 7.6 m wide. There are also several cathedral like alcoves that branch from the main tunnel. It is in these alcoves that most of the scientific experiments were conducted. The emplacement drifts smaller diameter tunnels branching off the main tunnel where waste would have been stored were not constructed since they required a construction authorization by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The repository has a statutory limit of 77,000 metric tons 85,000 short tons . To store this amount of waste would have required 40 miles 64 km of tunnels. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act further limits the capacity of the repository to 63,000 metric tons 62,000 long tons 69,000 short tons of initial heavy metal in commercial spent fuel. The 104 U.S. commercial reactors currently operating will produce this quantity of spent fuel by 2014, assuming that the spent fuel rods are not reprocessed. Currently, the US has no civil reprocessing plant. By 2008, Yucca Mountain was one of the most studied pieces of geology in the world between geologic studies and materials science the United States had invested US 9 billion on the project. This site studied by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology NBMG differs substantially from other potential repositories due to the finding of natural analogues of nuclear material that are currently being studied. The DOE estimates that it has over 100 million U.S. gallons of highly radioactive waste and 2,500 metric tons 2,800 short tons of spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons and from research activities in temporary storage. The cost of the facility is being paid for by a combination of a tax on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power and by the taxpayers for disposal of weapons and naval nuclear waste. Based on the 2001 cost estimate, approximately 73 percent is funded from consumers of nuclear powered electricity and 27 percent by the taxpayers. The Total System Life Cycle Cost presented to Congress on July 15, 2008 by Director Sproat was 90 billion. This cost, could not be compared to previous estimates since it included a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time 100 years vs 30 years . Additionally, the cost of the project continued to escalate because of insufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project. By 2007, the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of 135,000 metric tons 149,000 short tons , or 300 million pounds. The tunnel boring machine TBM that excavated the main tunnel cost 13 million and was 400 ft 120 m in length when in operation. It now sits at its exit point at the South Portal south entrance of the facility. The short side tunnel alcoves were excavated using explosives. The DOE was scheduled to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain repository by January 31, 1998. As of 2010 , years after this deadline, the future status of the repository at Yucca Mountain was still unknown due to on going litigation, and opposition by Nevada Senator Harry Reid. Because of construction delays, a number of nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to dry cask storage of waste on site indefinitely in steel and concrete casks. The project is widely opposed in Nevada and is a hotly debated national topic. A two thirds majority of Nevadans feel it is unfair for their state to have to store nuclear waste when there are no nuclear power plants in Nevada. Many Nevadans' opposition stemmed from the so called Screw Nevada Bill, the 1987 legislation halting study of Hanford and Texas as potential sites for the waste before conclusions could be made. The local county in which the proposed facility is located, Nye County, supports the development of the repository as do six adjoining counties. A 2015 survey of Nevadans found 55 agreeing that the state should be open to having a discussion on what benefits could be received. One point of concern has been the standard of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350 millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued a draft of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000 years mean public dose would be 0.24 mrem year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98 mrem year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that. On February 12, 2002, U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham made the decision that this site was suitable to be the nation's nuclear repository. The governor of Nevada had 90 days to object and did so. However, the United States Congress overrode the objection. If the governor's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue, when Senator John Kerry D said that he would abandon the plans if elected. In March 2005, the Energy and Interior departments revealed that several U.S. Geological Survey hydrologists had exchanged e mails discussing possible falsification of quality assurance documents on water infiltration research. On February 17, 2006, the DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management OCRWM released a report confirming the technical soundness of infiltration modeling work performed by U.S. Geological Survey USGS employees. In March 2006, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Majority Staff issued a 25 page white paper Yucca Mountain The Most Studied Real Estate on the Planet. The conclusions were On January 18, 2006, DOE OCRWM announced that it would designate Sandia National Laboratories as its lead laboratory to integrate repository science work for the Yucca Mountain Project. We believe that establishing Sandia as our lead laboratory is an important step in our new path forward. The independent, expert review that the scientists at Sandia will perform will help ensure that the technical and scientific basis for the Yucca Mountain repository is without question, OCRWM's Acting Director Paul Golan said. Sandia has unique experience in managing scientific investigations in support of a federally licensed geologic disposal facility, having served in that role as the scientific advisor to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Sandia began acting as the lead laboratory on October 1, 2006. Because of questions raised by the State of Nevada and Congressional members about the quality of the science behind Yucca Mountain, the DOE announced on March 31, 2006 the selection of Oak Ridge Associated Universities Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education a not for profit consortium that includes 96 doctoral degree granting institutions and 11 associate member universities to provide expert reviews of scientific and technical work on the Yucca Mountain Project. DOE stated that the Yucca Mountain Project will be based on sound science. By bringing in Oak Ridge for review of technical work, DOE will seek to present a high level of expertise and credibility as they move the project forward ... This award gives DOE access to academic and research institutions to help DOE meet their mission and legal obligation to license, construct, and open Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for spent nuclear fuel. There was significant public and political opposition to the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository project in Nevada. An attempt was made to push ahead with the project and override this opposition. But for large projects which would take decades to complete, there is every chance that sustained local opposition will prevail, and this happened with the Yucca Mountain project. Successful nuclear waste storage siting efforts in Scandinavia have involved local communities in the decision making process and given them a veto at each stage, but this did not happen with Yucca Mountain. Local communities at potential storage and repository sites should have early and continued involvement in the process, including funding that would allow them to retain technical experts . On March 5, 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate hearing that the Yucca Mountain site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste. On March 3, 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application, however multiple lawsuits to stop this action have been filed by states, counties, and individuals across the country as being unauthorized by the NWPA. The costly nuclear accident in 2014 at New Mexico's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in which a nuclear waste container exploded, has caused doubt that it could serve as an alternative for Yucca. In 2019, the Reno Gazette Journal published a long form essay cataloging opposition to the Yucca Mountain location. According to a tribal elder, the Western Shoshone view Yucca Mountain as sacred and a nuclear storage facility will poison everything. The tribes state that they lack funds to discredit federal safety claims, but will be directly affected by a potential disaster. The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time. Shortly after the EPA first established these standards in 2001, the nuclear industry, several environmental and public interest groups, and the State of Nevada challenged the standards in court. In July 2004, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found in favor of the Agency on all counts except one the 10,000 year regulatory time frame. The court ruled that EPA's 10,000 year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with National Academy of Sciences NAS recommendations and was too short. The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk, which might approach a period of one million years. By limiting the compliance time to 10,000 years, EPA did not respect a statutory requirement that it develop standards consistent with NAS recommendations. EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the EPA has two dose standards that would apply based on the number of years from the time the facility is closed. For the first 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule's dose limit of 15 millirem per year. This is protection at the level of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100 millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1 mrem year public dose through 1,000,000 years. The formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite welded tuff , non welded tuff, and semi welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation. It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts. The volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain is appreciably fractured and movement of water through an aquifer below the waste repository is primarily through fractures. While the fractures are usually confined to individual layers of tuff, the faults extend from the planned storage area all the way to the water table 600 to 1,500 ft 180 to 460 m below the surface. Future water transport from the surface to waste containers is likely to be dominated by fractures. There is evidence that surface water has been transported down through the 700 ft 210 m of overburden to the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain in less than 50 years. Some site opponents assert that, after the predicted containment failure of the waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will be stored in such a way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility. The area around Yucca Mountain received much more rain in the geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today, though well below the level of the repository. Nevada ranks fourth in the nation for current seismic activity. Earthquake databases the Council of the National Seismic System Composite Catalogue and the Southern Great Basin Seismic Network provide current and historical earthquake information. Analysis of the available data in 1996 indicates that, since 1976, there have been 621 seismic events of magnitude greater than 2.5 within a 50 mile 80 km radius of Yucca Mountain. DOE has stated that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not significantly affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000 year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading. In September 2007, it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels. The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east, and drew criticism from Robert R. Loux, then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, who argues that Yucca administrators should have known about the fault line's location years prior, and called the movement of the structures just in time engineering. In June 2008, a major nuclear equipment supplier, Holtec International, criticized the Department of Energy's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste before they are buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump. The concern is that, in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts . The nuclear waste was planned to be shipped to the site by rail and or truck in robust containers known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions. Within Nevada, the planned primary mode of transportation was via rail through the Caliente Corridor. This corridor starts in Caliente, Nevada, traveling along the northern and western borders of the Nevada Test Site for approximately 200 miles 320 km . At this point, it turns south. Other options that were being considered included a rail route along the Mina corridor. This rail route would have originated at the Fort Churchill Siding rail line, near Wabuska. The proposed corridor would have proceeded southeast through Hawthorne, Blair Junction, Lida Junction and Oasis Valley. At Oasis Valley, the rail line would have turned north northeast towards Yucca Mountain. Use of this rail corridor by the Department of Energy would have required permission from the Walker River Paiute Tribe in order to cross their land. As the first 54 miles 87 km of the proposed corridor was owned by the Department of Defense, additional permission from the DoD would have to have been granted. Since the early 1960s, the U.S. has safely conducted more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record is comparable to the worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain. However, cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through heavily populated areas. Dr. Robert Halstead, who was a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, stated regarding transportation of the high level waste, They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha. Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through downtown Las Vegas, up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well. Spencer Abraham DOE on the other hand has stated, I think there's a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely. In October 2018, a senator from Utah argued that transferring nuclear waste from other states to Yucca Mountain on state highways and railways could be a health hazard. Archaeological surveys have found evidence that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact. Yucca Mountain and surrounding lands were central in the lives of the Southern Paiute, Western Shoshone, and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples, who shared them for religious ceremonies, resource uses, and social events. Starting in 2009, the Obama administration attempted to close the Yucca Mountain repository, despite current US law that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository. The administration agency, DOE, began implementation of the President's plan in May 2009. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also went along with the administration's closure plan. Various state and Congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration's closure plans, by statute and in court. Most recently, in August 2013, a US Court of Appeals decision told the NRC and the Obama administration that they must either approve or reject the Energy Department's application for never completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain. They cannot simply make plans for its closure in violation of US law. In May 2009, then United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stated Yucca Mountain as a repository is off the table. What we're going to be doing is saying, let's step back. We realize that we know a lot more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago. The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long term strategy. We will be assembling a blue ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long lived actinide waste. These are fast neutron reactors. There's others a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high energy neutrons that can burn down the long lived actinides. ... Some of the waste is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no economical reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagineagain, it depends on what the blue ribbon panel saysone could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymorethat's good. It's a very natural containment. ... whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that. So the real thing is, let's get some really wise heads together and figure out how you want to deal with the interim and long term storage. Yucca was supposed to be everything to everybody, and I think, knowing what we know today, there's going to have to be several regional areas. In 2008, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works found that failure to perform to contractual requirements could cost taxpayers up to 11 billion by 2020. In 2013 this estimate of taxpayer liability was raised to 21 billion. In July 2009, the House of Representatives voted 388 to 30 on amendments to HHR3183 Roll call vote 591, via Clerk.House.gov to not defund the Yucca Mountain repository in the FY2010 budget. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted twice during the 2014 Energy and Water Appropriations debate by over 80 majority to reject elimination of Yucca Mountain as the nation's only nuclear waste solution. On April 13, 2010, the state of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain, since this would slow efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation. South Carolina, Aiken County the location of Savannah River site and others joined Washington. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on the withdrawal of the license application. Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29. With 32 billion received from power companies to fund the project, and 12 billion spent to study and build it, the federal government had 27 billion left, including interest. In March 2012, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bill requiring three fourths of that money to be given back to customers, and the remainder to the companies for storage improvements. In August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to either approve or reject the Energy Department's application for never completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain. The court opinion said that the NRC was simply flouting the law in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository remains in effect. The court opinion stated that The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. In response, NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report SER , this presented the NRC staff's statement that the site would meet all applicable standards. At the same time, the staff also stated that NRC should not authorize actual construction of the repository until the requirements for land and water rights were met and a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement EIS was finished. On March 3, 2015, NRC ordered the staff to complete the supplemental EIS and make the Yucca Mountain licensing document database publicly available, using all the remaining previously appropriated licensing funds. In March 2015 the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 S854 was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. It was intended to establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration NWA which would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local, and tribal governments which may be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non operating reactors and other emergency deliveries called priority waste . The goal would be to have a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other non priority waste available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nation's initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from that fund any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by annual appropriations or authorizations. S854 died in committee. The Nuclear Waste Fund had 42.4 billion at the end of FY15, 46.0 billion at the end of FY16, and 44.5 billion on 9 30 17 projecting as of the midpoint of FY18 a balance of probably less than 42 billion due to rising interest rates lowering the value of investments. On March 15, 2017, the Trump Administration announced it would request Congressional approve for 120 million to restart licensing activity at the Yucca Mountain repository, with funding also to be used to create an interim storage program. The project would consolidate nuclear waste across the United States in Yucca Mountain, which had been stockpiled in local locations since 2010. The federal budget proposal was refused by Senate. Although his administration had allocated money to the project, in October 2018, President Donald Trump stated he opposed the use of Yucca mountain for dumping, saying he agreed with the people of Nevada. On May 11, 2018, the bill H.R. 3053 was approved in a 34072 vote in the House of Representatives. The bill directed the DOE to resume the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, with licensing for a permanent site at the mountain to take up to five years. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act was sponsored by John Shimkus. The Hill clarified that the bill would set a path forward for the Department of Energy DOE to resume the process of planning for and building the southern Nevada site, transfer land to the DOE for it, ease the federal funding mechanism and allow DOE to build or license a temporary site to store waste while the Yucca project is being planned and built. The bill would direct the Energy Department to revive the licensing process for Yucca Mountain to be designated as the countrys permanent site for nuclear waste. The bill would bring together waste from 121 locations in 39 states. All Nevada representatives opposed the bill. The measure afterwards was scheduled to go to Senate, which if passed, would require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to decide on the matter within 30 months. The Hill noted that the bill received widespread support from lawmakers arguing that nuclear waste was best transferred out of their districts to Yucca, a concept opposed by Nevada representatives, with politicians such as Dina Titus dubbing it the Screw Nevada 2.0 bill. Titus proposed an amendment which would have required long term storage to be kept in locales that consented, which was rejected by the house 332 80. In their opposition to the use of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear repository, Nevada representatives were supported by Dianne Feinstein of California and other politicians. In June 2018, the Trump administration and some members of Congress again began proposing using Yucca Mountain, with Nevada Senators raising opposition. By early 2019, use of Yucca Mountain was in political limbo as opposition to the site led to an impasse. In January 2019, a panel of scientists introduced to Congress a 126 page report, Reset of Americas Nuclear Waste Management, which proposed including Yucca Mountain as a potential repository with development of a consensus based siting process, but one that would still include Yucca Mountain as a candidate. Nevada National Security Site officials in April 2019 assured the public that the Device Assembly Facility on the Nevada security site was safe from earthquake threats. In contrast, Nevada officials claimed seismic activity in the region made it unsafe for the storage of nuclear waste. On April 1, 2019, the Las Vegas Review Journal noted that Nevada Democrats in the House were seeking to block transfers of plutonium from the Department of Energy into the state by the use of the appropriations process.

"Yue Hwa Building Chinese pinyin Yuhua dasha is a historic building located at the junction of Eu Tong Sen Street and Upper Cross Street in Chinatown, Singapore. Built by Swan and Maclaren in 1927, it was then the tallest building in Chinatown and was known as Nam Tin Building , owned by Lum Chang Holdings. The building housed the six storey Great Southern Hotel the first Chinese hotel with a lift , along with a few shops and cabarets that were popular among Chinese travellers. In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings sold the building to Hong Kong businessman Yu Kwok Chun, who converted it to the first Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store in Singapore in 1994. The renovation process, which conserved the exterior while adding features such as an atrium and waterfall to the interior, won the building the Architectural Heritage Award by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1997. Also known as Nam Tin Hotel, the Great Southern Hotel in Singapore's Chinatown was built by Swan and Maclaren in 1927. Started as a boutique hotel, it was the tallest building in Chinatown when it was completed. It was also the first Chinese hotel in Singapore with a lift. Its height also gave it an unfortunate reputation as the focal point of many suicide attempts in its early days, until the tall Singapore Improvement Trust flats at Upper Pickering Street were built. Owned by Lum Chang Holdings, the building housing Great Southern Hotel was called Nam Tin in Cantonese, meaning southern sky . This choice of name is curious because the Chinese's discovery of the sky around the southern celestial was relatively recent, when Xu Guangqi interpreted European star charts. It is thus possible that this building in Singapore, a colonial port, has a name in homage of this turn of events. Besides the hotel, Lum Chang Holdings also leased out the building to several tenants who operated shops and other businesses. The L shaped ground floor was partitioned for 8 of these shops. People commonly referred to the entire Nam Tin building as the Great Southern Hotel when the hotel subsequently became very popular. The Nam Tin Building became a major shopping hub for customers who found it fashionable to patronise the building's shops, outlets and cabarets. Chinese operas used to be staged at the building as an occasional attraction. The Southern Cabaret, based in the Diamond Dragon Dance Palace on the fifth floor, was of particular extravagance, as this article in The Straits Times describes it Dragon pillars studded with cut glass... constructed under the supervision of Miss Leong Sai Chan, former Shanghai movie star, the cabaret is an imitation of China's famed Peking palace. Beautifully coloured carvings of birds and animals of Chinese mythology decorate the walls of cabaret. Operated by the Cantonese, the Great Southern Hotel catered more to Chinese travellers, including celebrities from Hong Kong and China. This was unlike the upmarket hotels like Raffles Hotel, Goodwood Park Hotel and Adelphi Hotel which then accommodated mainly Europeans and English speaking visitors. As a boutique hotel with shops and entertainment outlets for rich Chinese immigrants, the Great Southern Hotel was considered as the Raffles Hotel of Chinatown . Each room had its own ensuite shower and toilet, and was given a roomy feeling by the 4m high ceiling and cast iron casement windows. The latter let in far more light than the wooden windows commonly found on shophouses in the now Kreta Ayer Conservation Area, which were largely in the Transitional and Art Deco styles. Celebrities, artists, and merchants enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, such as a disco ball specially imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17 table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, with her husband in a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities. The building and its tenants were such an anchoring presence in the area that Eu Tong Sen street was colloquially known as , or, In front of Nam Tin . The pre eminence of the Great Southern Hotel as an entertainment destination did not last. In 1956, the Cathay Organization bought the adjacent Majestic Theatre and transformed it into an attraction that drew film stars from Hong Kong. Changing entertainment preferences, a depressed economy, and socio political unrest also contributed to the decline of Chinese opera and dances at the hotel. The popularity of Chinese opera declined throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and by 1959, even famous wayang theatres just one block down the street, such as Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun were closed People's Park Complex was built over that spot . Taxi dancers , so named because these dancers for hire would hang around cabarets like waiting taxis, were also falling out of fashion with the introduction of rock n roll at dance clubs, a genre of music that was then becoming increasingly popular with youths. By the 1960s, these dances were the most popular form of entertainment for Singaporean youth, and the hotel's cabaret took a backseat. Nam Tins facade reflected this decline. Through the 1960s to 1980s, the large red Southern Cabaret signage that adorned the Eu Tong Sen Street facing side of the building were removed, and branding of the building became more nondescript. The red hotel signage on the corner arch of the ground floor also faded with the lack of maintenance, they were barely visible by 1988. The shops at the ground floor also changed with the clientele. While shopping there was once seen as fashionable, stalls selling common electrical appliances now took up most of the ground floor frontage. The rooftop balcony and loggia visibly fell into disuse, with half collapsed banners that advertised events that had passed by a year ago. In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings sold the building at a price of S 25 million to Yu Kwok Chun, who was the head of a Hong Kong based multinational corporation with its flagship department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium. The company, set up by Yu's father in 1959, is a global corporation of 35 companies involved in investments, travel and general trading. Yue Hwa's three department stores in Hong Kong are popular with both Hong Kongers and tourists. Besides agricultural produce from various provinces of China, the stores also sell jade carvings, handicrafts, antiques and medical products such as ginseng, antlers and cordyceps. In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel ended its operations from the building as the hotel faced increasing competition in the hospitality industry. At the time of its closure, the hotel was operating only 40 rooms that were equipped with a double bed and a ceiling fan, catering mainly to budget travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum. As the 999 year leasehold building has been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority URA for architectural conservation, the new owner was asked to preserve the building's facade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out on the building from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles. Being one of the tallest buildings in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building was that of the Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey coloured facade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was one of the first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall. At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was the first Chinese hotel to have a lift. The original design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on the second and third storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The whole of the fifth floor was occupied by a then well known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor. The architectural firm engaged for the S 25 million restoration project was O.D. Architects of Bukit Pasoh Road. In accordance with URA's conservation guidelines for Nam Tin Building, the architects preserved the building's roof top garden and balconies facing Eu Tong Sen Street. The interior of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and could be used as an exhibition hall. A four storey high waterfall was built at the back of the building, which has a new three storey extension. A stained glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres 39,800 to 49,500 square feet , with 4,650 square metres 50,000 square feet of retail space created for use by the store. Together with the acquisition of the Nam Tin Building in 1993, Yue Hwa Chinese Products invested a total of S 100 million to set up its first store selling Chinese products in Singapore. For its conservation and restoration work, the Yue Hwa Building won URA's Architectural Heritage Award in 1997.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue%20Hwa%20Building
"Yuffie Kisaragi , Yufi Kisaragi is a video game character from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, she was first introduced in the 1997 role playing video game Final Fantasy VII as a young female ninja princess and thief. She can become one of the game's player characters after finishing a special sidequest. Yuffie reappears in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII series, expanding her background and showing her after the events of the original game. Yuffie has further been featured in other Square Enix games, most notably the Kingdom Hearts crossover series, voiced by Yumi Kakazu in the Japanese versions of the games. In the English versions, Christy Carlson Romano provides her voice for Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, and Mae Whitman is Yuffie's voice for Kingdom Hearts II and Dirge of Cerberus Final Fantasy VII. The character has achieved a high level of popularity in Japan, but the English language media reception has been more mixed. One of two secret characters in the 1997 role playing video game Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie is a 16 year old ninja and a thief who fights with oversized shuriken that she can throw like a boomerang. A fiercely patriotic daughter of Godo Kisaragi , Godo Kisaragi , the leader of Wutai , Utai , a culture based on real world East Asia, Yuffie feels her country has lost its former glory and become nothing more than a resort town. After losing the war against Shinra Electric Power Company, Godo began to turn Wutai into a tourist attraction. This did not suit Yuffie, who began running off, stealing the magical Materia from unaware travelers in hope to someday become strong enough to change this situation. Sneaky and arrogant, Yuffie has a tomboyish and charismatic personality and obsessively steals and collects Materia. She also tends to be short tempered and is prone to motion sickness. Gameplay wise, Yuffie possesses the special Materia Throw , enabling her to throw almost any item from the player's inventory at enemies during combat, and when leveled up, the ability Coin becomes available, allowing her to throw the party's Gil currency at the enemy. Yuffie is introduced when she ambushes the protagonist Cloud Strife and his allies in either the Gongaga jungle or the forests south of Junon, appearing as Mystery Ninja . If the player defeats her in combat and then chooses the correct series of dialogue choices, she introduces herself and joins the player's party as one of player characters. However, once in Wutai Village, Yuffie steals the party's Materia and hides, but is kidnapped by a Midgar crime lord, the lecherous Don Corneo. When the group rescues Yuffie, she returns the stolen Materia and continues working with the party. In another sidequest, she proves herself by fighting the bosses of Wutai's five story pagoda, the last of these battles against Godo. These fights, and the sequence of conversations following, enable both father and daughter to understand the other's actions and to come to a mutual respect. At Godo's request, Cloud officially takes Yuffie who obtains her level 4 Limit Break special attack, called All Creation with him on his quest. If Yuffie is present at the end of disc one, when Aerith Gainsborough is murdered by the party's nemesis Sephiroth, the player can witness an uncharacteristic display of emotion from the character, as she breaks down in Cloud's arms after failing to control her sobs. Yuffie's loyalty to the team is called into question after Cloud temporarily disbands his party ahead of their final confrontation with Sephiroth when Yuffie is the last to return Barret Wallace suspects her of abandoning the team in light of her earlier treachery at Wutai. When Yuffie returns to the group she subsequently rebukes Barrett for his judgement. In the 2005 computer animated film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, Yuffie reunites with her Final Fantasy VII allies to fight against the summon creature Bahamut SIN. In the On the Way to a Smile novella Case of Yuffie , which is set between the end of Final Fantasy VII and the beginning of Advent Children, the disease Geostigma spreads to Wutai, and Yuffie sets out to find a cure. In the 2004 action role playing game Before Crisis Final Fantasy VII, set six years before Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie encounters Shinra's agents called the Turks in Wutai and unknowingly works with them against the eco terrorist group AVALANCHE. In the 2006 third person shooter game Dirge of Cerberus Final Fantasy VII, set one year after Advent Children, Yuffie leaves home and joins the World Regenesis Organization, where she is placed in charge of espionage and intelligence gathering. Yuffie infiltrates Mako Reactor Zero deep within the ruins of Midgar and shuts it off when the ex Turk Vincent Valentine defeats the Shinra remnant Deepground. The nine year old Yuffie makes brief appearances in the 2007 prequel action role playing game Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, where she fights against Shinra following their invasion and takeover of Wutai. After meeting Zack Fair, she enlists his help to find treasures in several side missions. Outside the Final Fantasy series, Yuffie has also been featured in the Kingdom Hearts series since 2002. In the first Kingdom Hearts, a younger Yuffie acts as a supporting character in Traverse Town, helping to defeat the Heartless who had destroyed her world. Yuffie's appearance in 2004's Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is a projection from Sora's memories in Traverse Town. In 2005's Kingdom Hearts II, she aids Leon and the others as part of the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee, this time appearing in her Advent Children attire. In both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, Yuffie is additionally featured as an opponent in the Olympus Coliseum, while 2008's Kingdom Hearts coded features a virtual simulation of Yuffie. She also appears in the manga adaptations of Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts II and Chain of Memories published by Gangan Comics and Tokyopop. Yuffie is an unlockable playable character in the PlayStation version of the 1998 fighting game Ehrgeiz God Bless the Ring, appearing alongside other characters from Final Fantasy VII. She is also one of the playable characters in the 2006 board video game Itadaki Street Portable for the PlayStation Portable, in a chibi style design that is similar to her model during the exploration gameplay mode of Final Fantasy VII, and in the 2013 action puzzle mobile game Pictlogica Final Fantasy, also in a chibi form. She was the first DLC character released for the 2014 rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call, returning in 2016's arcade game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy All Star Carnival. Yuffie is also appearing as a playable character in the free to play role playing video games Final Fantasy Record Keeper 2014 and Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia 2017 . Yuffie also makes unplayable appearances in some video games. In the 2008 action role playing fighting game hybrid Dissidia Final Fantasy, she is a tutor of the in game manuals and an unlockable friend card in this game. Yuffie is a Legend type assist character in the 2012 social role playing mobile game Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade, depicted in her Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts outfits. She appears as one of three summonable support characters in the 2014 racing mobile game Final Fantasy VII G Bike and is featured in the card video cames Final Fantasy Trading Card Game 2011 and Final Fantasy Artniks 2012 . Two large Yuffie action figures were released by Square Enix as part of the Final Fantasy VII Play Arts Vol. 2 series in 2008 in her original game attire , and Final Fantasy VII Movie Advent Children Series 2 in 2009 in her film attire . Other merchandise include a small super deformed figurine version as she appears in Itadaki Street Portable, from 2009's Final Fantasy Trading Arts Mini Vol. 4, a 1997 plush doll and a keyholder figurine by Banpresto, a 2001 garage kit figure by Kotobukiya, and a wallscroll poster in Final Fantasy Poster Vol. 5. Her theme music in Final Fantasy VII, Descendant of Shinobi , is included in a vocal form on the album Final Fantasy Song Book Mahoroba as Walking in the Road, After the Rain by Nobuo Uematsu and Yuji Hasegawa. During early development of Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie was envisioned as a 25 year old ex SOLDIER now working as a bounty hunter, seeking both the game's protagonist Cloud Strife and its antagonist Sephiroth, while too having a bounty on her own head. Her job class was originally listed as ninja assassin and she was intended to be a daughter of the long deceased Kasumi Kisaragi. The Wutai sidequest present in the final incarnation of the game was significantly different. Her age and description was different for each of the several wanted posters what Yuffie looks like, as her level, is determined on the last wanted poster viewed. She would encounter the party in a random encounter, or attack Cloud when he is sleeping in an inn. The Wutai scenario required Yuffie to be recruited to complete it. Having a close attachment to Yuffie's character, Final Fantasy VII event planner Jun Akiyama was responsible for the large number of cutscenes featuring her and her actions during fights. Regarding the use of Japanese pronouns, Yuffie uses atashi as opposed to the other female characters who use watashi, perhaps to make her sound more cute or youthful, as she is younger than the others. Mae Whitman, who voiced Yuffie in the English versions of Kingdom Hearts II and Dirge of Cerberus, said she was not aware of the extent to which people were familiar with her character already. In a 2012 interview, Whitman recalled Yuffie as bubbly and bright and nice. But still super cool Yuffie's design in Kingdom Hearts was partially based on the originally planned appearance of Rikku from Final Fantasy X. Yuffie Kisaragi has received a notably positive reception in Japan, having placed as the 42nd best PlayStation character in the 2007 Den Play Awards by Dengeki PlayStation. In 2010, readers of Japanese magazine Famitsu voted her as the 48th best video game character of all time. In a 2013 poll by Square Enix, Yuffie was voted the 14th most popular Final Fantasy female character, sharing that spot with Beatrix from Final Fantasy IX. Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM included seeing Yuffie once again as one of the greatest moments of Kingdom Hearts while giving it their Role Playing Game of the Year 2002 award. David Smith from IGN ranked Yuffie seventh on the 2008 list of top ten Final Fantasy VII characters, stating that she belongs in the Wacky Sidekicks wing of the RPG hall of fame although commenting that Yuffie can sometimes be a pain in the neck, Smith said that she became such an appealing sidekick character that Square would go on to use the Yuffie formula with Rikku for Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy VII director Yoshinori Kitase asked EGM why American gamers love Yuffie so much. They were unable to come with a clear answer. According to Edge, Yuffie, being one of characters that are brands in and of themselves , created a new anime stereotype the, uh, giddy girl ninja. WomanGamers.com gave the character an overall score of 7.0 10, opining that while a 16 year old ninja girl was a nice refreshing change ... it would have been nice if her character had matured and developed through this story. In 2012, Becky Cunningham of Cheat Code Central ranked her as the fourth top ninja in video games, stating that despite her cocky, brash, and slightly abrasive personality, Yuffie is also a compassionate person with an impressive goal, serving as both comic relief and unlikely hero, a seemingly self centered sneak thief who always does the right thing in the end. In 2013, Liam Gilchrist of What Culture included her ten memorable Final Fantasy characters that deserve their own game, possibly a Thief esque title, but more suitable for younger players. In a 2014 poll by Spanish magazine Hobby Consolas, Yuffie was voted one of eight best ninja characters in video games. Marcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed Yuffie at fifth spot on his 2014 list of top female ninja characters in games, commenting on her close resemblance to Makimachi Misao from Rurouni Kenshin. In 2012, Jef Rouner of the Houston Press listed Yuffie's reaction to Aerith's death as one of the five most heartbreaking missable scenes in the Final Fantasy franchise which he felt rivalled the emotional impact of anything found in the main narrative. UGO.com featured her in the 2011 list of 25 most sexy ninja girls in all media for her appearance in Advent Children, adding that third dimension certainly adds something. In his review for Advent Children, James Mielke of 1UP.com called her as cutely jailbait as ever the film itself was called Ogling Legal Age Yuffie by Geson Hatchett of Hardcore Gamer. In 2015, Indonesian television Liputan 6 ranked her seventh in their list of the sexiest Oriental characters in gaming. However, some of the reception was more negative. In her character profile, IGN wrote called her both impressively useful and incredibly annoying. GameFan editor The 6th Man compared himself to Yuffie, as in one wordannoying but also having that innocent, naive qualify. In 2010, Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com placed her in the category The Perky Idiot alongside Rikku and Selphie while discussing the top five character types in the Final Fantasy series. That same year, GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz included the appearance of Yuffie among the other Final Fantasy VII characters in Ehrgeiz on the list of the 55 best character cameos in video game history, but called her hyper annoying . In 2013, Kyle Lowe of Complex ranked her as the fifth most annoying classic video game character. Joe Juba of Game Informer included her among Final Fantasy's particular breed of annoying female companions, like Selphie and Vaan. Lisa Foiles of The Escapist included this crazy, hyperactive teenager on her 2014 list of top five annoying princesses in video games, calling her just a definition of annoying.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuffie%20Kisaragi
"1992 1993 1994 1995 The 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia was a series of engagements between the Yugoslav People's Army JNA , the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force, and the Croatian National Guard ZNG then the Croatian Army HV during the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA was originally deployed in order to preserve Yugoslavia, and the initial plan of the campaign entailed the military occupation of Croatia and the removal of the Croatian leadership elected in 1990. The JNA intervention was the culmination of its involvement in the confiscation of weapons from Croatia's Territorial Defence, and in the Croatian Serb revolt that had begun in August 1990. From that time, the JNA had been frequently deployed to form a buffer zone between the insurgents and the ZNG or the Croatian police. In effect, these JNA buffer zones often secured the territorial gains of the insurgents and led to an increasingly hostile relationship between the JNA and Croatia. The JNA campaign plan was amended shortly before the campaign to include the relief of JNA barracks besieged by the ZNG. The besieging and subsequent capture of several JNA facilities allowed Croatia to arm its previously poorly equipped military and to equip new recruits. The campaign effectively started on 20 September 1991, even though relatively minor offensive actions had already been undertaken. By the end of the month, it suffered from serious delays and manpower shortages caused by low call up turnout in Serbia. In early October, the original campaign objectives were reduced as Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and his allies gained greater control of the JNA. Subsequently, the campaign objectives were redefined to deny the Croatian Government access to parts of Croatia that contained substantial Serb populations and to protect Croatian Serbs. The campaign culminated in late November and early December with the Battle of Vukovar and the Siege of Dubrovnik. A limited Croatian counterattack and the development of the HV led to a stalemate on the battlefield. The strategic situation permitted the development of the Vance plana ceasefire supervised by United Nations peacekeepers designed to create conditions for the political settlement of the conflict in Croatia. The Sarajevo Agreement, regarding the implementation of the ceasefire, was signed on 2 January 1992, bringing the campaign to an end. Nonetheless, the JNA took several more months to withdraw from Croatia as it was replaced by the UN peacekeepers. In 1991 alone, the conflict caused more than 7,000 deaths and the internal displacement of 400,000600,000 people. More than 1,700 persons remain missing as a result of the campaign. In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions increased. The Yugoslav People's Army Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija JNA confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence Teritorijalna obrana TO to minimize potential resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from the Yugoslav Presidency to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and by the summer of 1991, the JNA came under the control of the Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as the Yugoslav federation started to fall apart. Milosevic became de facto commander of the JNA once he secured control over the rump federal presidency and through his influence over the federal defence minister General Veljko Kadijevic and JNA chief of staff Blagoje Adzic. Milosevic, preferring a campaign aimed at expanding Serbia rather than preserving Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal presidency. This threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of the expansion of Serbia. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated and the first fatalities occurred. The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia considered this an act of secession. At the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, it doubled police numbers to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000 strong special police deployed in 12 battalions which adopted principles of military organization. In addition, there were 9,00010,000 regionally organized reserve police these were set up in 16 battalions and 10 independent companies, but the units lacked weapons. In May, in response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard Zbor narodne garde ZNG by amalgamating the special police battalions into four guards brigades. The guards brigades initially comprised about 8,000 troops, and were subordinated to the Ministry of Defence headed by retired JNA General Martin Spegelj. The regional police, by then expanded to 40,000, was also attached to the ZNG and re organized into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. The guards brigades were the only ZNG units that were fully equipped with small arms, while heavier weapons and an effective command and control structure were lacking throughout the ZNG. At the time, Croatian weapon stocks consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000 strong special police was established to replace the personnel transferred to the ZNG guards brigades. The Croatian view of the JNA role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuman was to win support for Croatia from the European Community EC and the United States, and he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to a defensive role even though the actions of the JNA appeared to be coordinated with Croatian Serb forces. This impression was reinforced by buffer zones the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNGthe JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of the territory. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks. After the start of the JNA intervention in Slovenia in late June, conscripts began deserting from the JNA and very few were drafted to replace them, except in Serbia. The JNA intervened directly against Croatia in early July in Baranja, north of the city of Osijek. On 1 August, they drove Croatian forces out of Erdut, Aljmas and Dalj, and out of Baranja around 22 August. During the summer of 1991, the Croatian Serb military consolidated in the territory under its control. In Banovina, Glina was captured from the ZNG on 26 July. That same day, two Croatian police stations near Hrvatska Kostajnica were captured, isolating the town. The attacks, codenamed Operation Stinger, were carried out by the 7th Banija Division, spearheaded by the Knin special police led by Dragan Vasiljkovic. In the aftermath of capture of the Kozibrod police station, Serb forces committed the first mass killing, involving the deaths of ten captured policemen and seventeen civilians. The ZNG successfully defended Hrvatska Kostajnica until mid September. In August, Croatian Serbs acting under the operational control of the JNA clashed with the ZNG around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci in eastern Slavonia. Fighting in eastern Slavonia led to ZNG blockades of JNA barracks in those cities and limited fighting against the garrisons there. In western Slavonia, the Croatian Serb militia attempted to advance into Daruvar but were held back by the ZNG in the area around Okucani and south of Pakrac before the JNA formed a buffer zone there. Following this fighting, Croatia was denied use of major transport routes between Zagreb and Slavonia. In northern Dalmatia, the JNA initiated several clashes with the ZNG and coordinated its advances with Croatian Serb forces. These attacks culminated in the capture of Kijevo on 26 August and the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. The capture of the bridge severed the last remaining road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. In the summer of 1991, the performance of the ZNG was poor because it lacked manpower and weapons, and exerted inadequate command and control. The professional ZNG troops were better trained than their opponents, with the exception of the Knin special police set up by the Serbian State Security Service. On 1 September 1991, Tuman accepted an EC proposed ceasefire and peace conference, despite his ultimatum demanding that the JNA return to its barracks by 31 August. After the Yugoslav Presidency also accepted it, the conference began on 7 September. Four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesic, ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. The move was motivated by Tuman's impression that the conference would have continued endlessly while the ZNG lost ground. The order was disputed by other members of the presidency, but it gave Croatia justification to openly confront the JNA. On 14 September, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. The ZNG blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots. The ZNG quickly captured isolated facilities and depots, as well as several major JNA posts, and seized large quantities of weaponsincluding the capture of entire stocks of the JNA 32nd Varazdin Corps and nearly all the weapons confiscated from Croatia's TO. The JNA lost control of eight brigadesincluding one armoured and two mechanized brigades, and three artillery regimentswhile additional forces in the JNA Fifth Military District and its Military Maritime District remained besieged. The significance of the Battle of the Barracks was reinforced by the introduction of a United Nations UN arms embargo on 25 September. In September, Anton Tus was appointed the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia. In early September 1991, the ZNG had 8,000 full time and 40,000 reserve troops. The four guards brigades of full time troops were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms, but even they lacked heavy weapons. A 10,000 strong special police force was established to replace the personnel transferred from the original special police units to the guards brigades. In September, the Croatian small arms stockpile consisted of 30,000 purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. The Battle of the Barracks resulted in a large increase to ZNG weapon holdingsallowing full arming of its existing units, raising of an additional 4042 brigades and fielding a total of 200,000 troops and 40,000 police by the end of the year. The ZNG captured 250 tanks, 400500 heavy artillery pieces, 180,000 small arms and 2,000,000 long tons 2,200,000 short tons of ammunition. In addition, 3,000 officers, mostly Croatian by nationality, changed allegiance and left the JNA to join the ZNG. In 1991, the ZNG was supported by the Croatian Defence Forces Croatian Hrvatske obrambene snage, HOS a militia raised by the Croatian Party of Rights. The party stated it had as many as 3,000 troops, but the police estimated it at 250 armed militiamen. The JNA planned a two stage mobilisation of troops. The first wave of call ups was performed in July, and was meant to intimidate Croatia without an actual offensive being launched and allow timely deployment of crucial units. After the first stage of the mobilisation failed to deter Croatian forces, the second stage commenced on 15 September it was met with a large scale refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units and to abandon some operations. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26 of those called up reported for service. Nonetheless, in September 1991, the JNA discharged conscripts that had completed their terms of service, and reached 73 of planned troop levels. The mobilisation problems demoralised JNA troops and commanders. A request made by JNA general command to Milosevic for general mobilisation to strengthen troop levels was denied because he did not believe the campaign was needed nor feasible. Despite the mobilisation problems, the JNA and the TO forces deployed in support of the campaign consisted of approximately 145,000 troops, 1,100 tanks, 700 other armoured vehicles and 1,980 artillery pieces, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Navy. The JNA developed a plan to defeat Croatia militarily, overthrow its government and create conditions necessary for the continued existence of Yugoslavia. The plan was amended in September 1991 to accommodate the besieging of JNA garrisons by the ZNG, incorporating the lifting of the blockade into the campaign objectives. The plan entailed five corps level campaigns designed to impose an air and naval blockade of Croatia, capture territory populated by Serbs and relieve barracks under ZNG siege. The axes of attack were specified as GradiskaVirovitica, BihacKarlovacZagreb, KninZadar and MostarSplit. Armoured and mechanized forces were tasked with the capture of eastern Slavonia and advances west towards Zagreb and Varazdin. This was identified as the main effort of the campaign. Finally, a land blockade of Dubrovnik was planned, coupled with an advance west towards the Neretva River to support the drive to Split. The plan may have proposed withdrawal of the JNA to Serb populated areas of Croatia or from the whole of Croatia after the objectives were completed, but sources conflict on that issue. In eastern Slavonia, the JNA responded to the ZNG siege of its garrison in Vukovar, and on 14 September 1991 it deployed troops to relieve the barracks. Independent of that effort, the main thrust of the campaign against Croatia was initially planned to start on 21 September. The southern operational group of the thrust, spearheaded by the 1st Guards Mechanised Division, was expected to lift the ZNG siege of the JNA barracks in Vinkovci, and reach Nasice and Slavonski Brod in two to three days. Over the next four to five days, the group was expected to reach the line OkucaniSuhopolje by advancing via the akovoPozega road and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, avoiding major population centres. The northern operational group, subordinated to the 12th Novi Sad Corps, was to advance from Osijek to Nasice and then further west towards Bjelovar. The two operational groups were assigned approximately 57,000 troops and 5,000 supporting personnel. The 17th Tuzla Corps was probably tasked with crossing the Sava Rivermarking the border of Croatiaat Slavonski Brod and Slavonski Samac to join the westward drive along the motorway, but the crossing never occurred. The campaign was brought forward by one day to 20 September. The change of schedule caused the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division to commit to battle as it arrived in eastern Slavonia with no reconnaissance or preparation. The resulting traffic jam on the SidTovarnikStari Jankovci road prevented bridging units from reaching the Bosut River. That in turn prevented the 1st Guards Division from crossing the river and confined it to the area between the Bosut and the Danube, east of Vinkovci. Besides the bridging units, the division did not receive the 80th Motorised Brigadewhich appears to have disintegrated before reaching the Croatian frontierand the 2nd Guards Mechanised Brigadea victim of friendly fire bombardment in the area between Tovarnik and Ilaca adjacent to the border. Several units of the Novi Sad Corps also disintegrated when morale declined after a number of friendly fire incidents. The Banja Luka Corps was tasked with the main axis of advance from Okucani to Daruvar and Virovitica in western Slavonia, and a secondary drive from Okucani towards Kutina. This task was consistent with the line expected to be reached by the main thrust of the JNA advancing from the east in about a week. The Corps had already deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okucani to support the advance that started on 21 September, and reached the Papuk Mountains. The Corps received two motorised brigades and one artillery brigade as reinforcements during the advance, but the problems with morale and desertions experienced in eastern Slavonia were also present in the Banja Luka Corps. In one such instance, the 130th Mechanised Brigade, sent as a reinforcement, had been reduced to a 280 strong battalion by 29 September. The JNA was stopped by the ZNG between Novska, Nova Gradiska and Pakrac, even though some Croatian Serb militia units took positions on the Bilogora and Papuk north of Pakrac near Virovitica, and Slatina, with no JNA support. The JNA Knin Corps, which had already fully mobilised and deployed, started the campaign in northern Dalmatia and southern Lika on 16 September 1991. It captured Drnis on 18 September, but sustained defeats at Pakovo Selo two days later and near Sibenik on 22 September as it attempted to capture the city. After this defeat, the Corps ceased its attacks, except for those around Gospic in Lika, for the rest of the month. Five days after the JNA and the Serbian Guard paramilitaries lost their positions in the city on 22 September, the Knin Corps captured Lovinac. JNA troops assembling near the southern tip of Croatia in the Dubrovnik hinterland consisted of elements of the Uzice and Titograd Corps. They had not advanced onto Croatian soil by the end of September because of mobilisation problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Banovina, the JNA captured Petrinja on 21 September, but failed to make further progress. Because of the failure of JNA mobilisation, the planned campaign in Kordun was limited to the consolidation of positions held around Karlovac. On 15 September, the Yugoslav Navy blockaded the Croatian Adriatic ports of Pula, Rijeka, Zadar, Split and Dubrovnik for a week. On 30 September, the general staff of the JNA reduced the objectives of the campaign because it had not followed the initial plan and had become bogged down. The reduced objectives called for offensive and defensive actions, the inflicting of decisive defeats on Croatian forces in Dalmatia and eastern Slavonia, and strikes against vital infrastructure in Croatia, to obtain an agreement on the evacuation of besieged JNA facilities. While some units on the ground started to implement the new orders the same day, they did not take effect completely before 4 October. On 3 October, Serbian and Montenegrin representatives in the Yugoslav Presidency declared that they alone had become the acting federal presidency and assumed control of the JNA. Two days later, the JNA requested that the presidency authorize a general mobilization of forces needed for the campaign, but this was refused by Milosevic. By 9 October, the JNA effort was considered a failure. Its commanders formally accepted the role forced on the JNA by Milosevic and limited its strategic objectives in Croatia to the protection of Serb populated areas. The JNA effort to relieve its Vukovar barracks turned into a protracted siege, delaying 36,000 troops and a significant proportion of armoured units slated for the thrust towards Zagreb and Varazdin. Vukovar was captured in mid November but the victory proved pyrrhic because it completely disrupted the overall campaign. During the Battle of Vukovar, the JNA formally approved the use of paramilitary volunteers to fill its ranks. These included the White Eagles and the Serb Volunteer Guard SVG , which were trained by the Serbian Ministry of Interior. On 12 October, the federal presidency authorized the JNA to enlist the volunteers as an estimated 150,000 people had emigrated from Yugoslavia, while others had taken refuge with friends or relatives to avoid the JNA draft. After capturing Vukovar, the JNA 12th Corps and the SVG advanced south west across the Bosut on 1516 November, and west between Vinkovci and Osijek, on 20 November, but the Croatian forcesrenamed the Croatian Army Hrvatska vojska HV that monthcontained their advances. According to General Zivota Panic, commander of the JNA 1st Military District at the time, the immediate objectives of the advances were Osijek and Zupanja. In Banovina, the JNA reached the Kupa River and captured its entire southern bank, except for ZNG bridgeheads in the areas of Nebojan, Sunja and Sisak, on 30 September. No further advances were achieved there. The JNA attempted an additional push towards the Nebojan bridgehead via Novi Farkasic on 1718 October, and another towards Sunja on 2 November, but both attempts failed. On 4 October, the JNA initiated an attack in Kordun, in the area of Karlovac, pushing the ZNG back in the area of Slunj two days later. On 8 October, it reached the banks of the Kupa and Korana Rivers and the intensity of fighting died down. The greatest flare up of hostilities in the area occurred on 45 November when a JNA garrison based in a suburb of Karlovac broke through the ZNG siege in the Battle of Logoriste and reached JNA held territory to the east of the city. Further south, the JNA captured Slunj on 17 November and Cetingrad on 29 November, eliminating a ZNG pocket in Kordun. JNA activity in Lika was limited to shelling and air raids on Gospic and Otocac, peaking on 4 October. On 1 October, the JNA Banja Luka Corps initiated probing attacks in western Slavonia, presaging a major effort employing the bulk of the corps three days later. The advance established defensive positions just outside Novska and Nova Gradiska, and captured Jasenovac on 8 October. Lipik and a part of Pakrac were captured four days later. By that time, the JNA campaign in western Slavonia had lost its momentum. In northern Dalmatia, the JNA Knin Corps attacked Zadar on 4 October, reaching its outskirts and lifting the ZNG siege of the Sepurine Barracks the next day. The advance was blocked by the ZNG and a truce was agreed on 7 October. Two days later, it was followed by an agreement to evacuate JNA facilities in Zadar, including equipment stored there. Further south, the JNA Titograd Corps and its Military Maritime District forces advanced from eastern Herzegovina and the Bay of Kotor, and pushed east and west of Dubrovnik on 1 October, placing besieging the city by the end of the month. The JNA was supported by Montenegro's TO in the area. Even though the Croatian troops defending the city were few, the city held out, sustaining increasingly intensive artillery, naval and air bombardment until a ceasefire was agreed in the area on 7 December. As the siege shaped international opinion on the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift towards the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, and resulted in the creation of a perception of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia as an aggressor state. The JNA attacks on Dubrovnik and Zadar were supported by the Yugoslav Navy, which blockaded the coast on two more occasions. On 3 October, all shipping off Croatia, except for ferry lines to Pag and islands in the Kvarner Gulf, was halted. The blockade, except for that of Dubrovnik, was lifted on 11 October. The final blockade, restricting access to Rijeka, Zadar, Sibenik and Split in addition to Dubrovnik, started on 8 November. On 15 November, the Yugoslav Navy sustained losses when it unsuccessfully attacked Split and the island of Brac. The Yugoslav blockade in the northern Adriatic ended on 22 November, but in the southern Adriaticexcept off Dubrovnikit was lifted on 3 December. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Even though the declaration had been preceded the day before by a Yugoslav Air Force attack on the presidential office in Zagreb, the Croatian authorities considered that the war situation was no longer critical. This assessment was followed by an order to prepare plans for a counter offensive on 12 October, and three more orders to commence offensive operations, which were issued by 20 November. The plans involved containing the JNA south of Osijek, advancing to the Bosut River south of Vinkovci, recapturing Jasenovac and the OkucaniLipik road to secure the Papuk and Psunj mountains, advancing towards Petrinja, Glina, Slunj, Korenica and Gracac, recapturing the Maslenica Bridge and the ObrovacGracac road, and stopping the JNA advance north west of Dubrovnik. The most significant results were produced in western Slavonia, where Croatian forces began pushing the JNA away from Grubisno Polje towards Lipik on 31 October, and away from Nova Gradiska towards Okucani on 12 November. In mid November, another push along the NovskaOkucani axis recaptured several villages by 9 December, while Lipik was recaptured by the Croatian forcesnow renamed the HVon 7 December. The mountains of Papuk and Bilogora, north of Pakrac where the Croatian Serb militia was not supported by the JNA, were brought under Croatian control in the same period. A HV offensive to recapture the Okucani area, codenamed Operation Orkan 91, commenced in the final days of December. The area was attacked from the directions of Pakrac, Novska and Nova Gradiska. The effort made no progress except west of Nova Gradiskabut even there it was very limited. Under international pressure, Tuman called off the offensive on 26 December. The second significant HV offensive was Operation Whirlwind, launched across the Kupa River on 11 December. The HV was tasked with advancing towards Glina but the operation failed after a shallow bridgehead was established within two days. In Lika, battles were fought for individual villages but little progress was made by either side. The JNA captured four villages south of Osijek between 21 November and 16 December but the front lines generally became static. The JNA campaign in Croatia ended in a stalemate, leading both sides to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire. By late November, the JNA was no longer in a position to make substantial advances, while Milosevic refused to pursue objectives that he no longer considered achievable. Between September and December 1991, the HV captured many weapons and significantly increased its capabilities. In mid January 1992, it commanded 155,772 troops and had 216 tanks, 127 other armoured vehicles and 1,108 artillery pieces at its disposal. Even though JNA positions in western Slavonia were on the brink of military collapse, the HV struggled elsewhere and its munitions stockpiles were depleted, while the UN arms embargo prevented its quick resupply. By the end of 1991, the conflict had killed 6,000 Croatians. Another 23,000 were wounded and 400,000 became internally displaced persons IDPs . Some sources report that there were as many as 600,000 IDPs. The 6,000 killed include 3,761 soldiers. JNA losses were officially reported at 1,279 killed in action, but the figure may have been considerably higher because casualties were consistently under reported during the war. The HV counter offensive in western Slavonia created 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled from the area when the JNA ordered the Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were subsequently settled in JNA held Baranja. In 1991 and early 1992, approximately 18,000 Croatian citizens were missing or held by the JNA or its allies. Approximately 8,000 of these were imprisoned in internment camps in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, or in Croatian territory controlled by the JNA. The camps were set up in Begejci, Stajicevo, Sremska Mitrovica, Nis, Aleksinac, Manjaca, Banja Luka, Knin, Bucje, Beli Manastir, Negoslavci, Vukovar and Morinj. Approximately 300 prisoners died while detained in the camps. Most of the prisoners had been released by August 1992. As of May 2013 1,703 were people still missing as a result of the 1991 campaign. Both sides committed numerous atrocities during the conflict. The most significant one committed by Croatian forces was the Gospic massacre. The atrocities committed by Serb forces were far greater in scale. The most significant ones were those committed in Kijevo, the killing of more than 200 prisoners of war in the aftermath of the Battle of Vukovar, and the bombardment of Dubrovnik. Those war crimes were subsequently prosecuted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which was set up in 1993 under the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 827. The atrocities prompted Germany to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition in mid November. It overcame opposition to the move from the United Kingdom, France and the United States by late December, and formally recognized Croatia on 23 December 1991. The German decision was followed by recognition from other EC member states on 15 January 1992. The Croatian Serbs in turn declared the establishment of the Republic of Serbian Krajina RSK on 21 December 1991 in JNA held areas comprising approximately 30 of Croatian territory. The RSK was entirely dependent on Serbia economically and financially. The battlefield stalemate allowed the implementation of the Vance planan outcome of the diplomatic mission to Yugoslavia by the Special Envoy of the Secretary General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance, aided by United States diplomat Herbert Okun, and Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs Marrack Goulding. It was aimed at producing a negotiated end to hostilities in Croatia. The plan proposed a ceasefire, the protection of civilians in specific areas designated as UN Protected Areas and deployment of UN peacekeepers in Croatia. The plan was endorsed by Milosevic, Kadijevic, and Tuman, and the three signed the Geneva Accord to that effect in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The accord provided for the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of delivery of humanitarian aid. The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia. The mission was subsequently authorised through United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November, following a formal request for the deployment of UN peacekeepers submitted by the Yugoslav government the previous day. The Implementation Agreement, ensuring the ceasefire required for the deployment of peacekeepers, was signed by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Susak and deputy commander of JNA 5th Military District General Andrija Raseta in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 2 January. The ceasefire generally held after it took effect on 3 January at 6 pm, except in the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA remained in positions around the town and in Konavle until July 1992. The naval blockade of Dubrovnik was lifted on 26 May 1992. As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the ceasefire agreement, the deployment of UN peacekeepers did not start until 8 March. The historian Marko Attila Hoare believes that the Vance plan saved the Croatian Serb rebels from defeat.

"The Yugoslav coup d'etat of 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, replaced the regency led by Prince Paul and installed King Peter II. It was planned and conducted by a group of pro Western Serb nationalist Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dusan Simovic, who had been associated with several putsch plots from 1938 onwards. Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirkovic, Major Zivan Knezevic of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knezevic were key organisers in the overthrow of the government. In addition to Radoje Knezevic, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of the takeover before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia played no part in the coup, although it made a significant contribution to the mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for it once it had occurred. The putsch was successful and deposed the three member regency Prince Paul, Radenko Stankovic and Ivo Perovic, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragisa Cvetkovic. Two days prior to its ousting, the Cvetkovic government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact Axis . The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive. The military conspirators brought to power the 17 year old King Peter II, whom they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a weak and divided government of national unity was formed with Simovic as prime minister and Vladko Macek and Slobodan Jovanovic as his vice premiers. The coup led directly to the German led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The importance of the putsch and subsequent invasion in delaying Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, is disputed but most scholars now consider that it had no significant impact on the eventual outcome of that campaign. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia, formed in 1918 under the name Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, incorporated diverse national and religious groups with varied historical backgrounds. These included Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Bosnian Muslims, Macedonians and Albanians, among others. Each of these national groups was strongly associated with one of the three dominant religions the Serbian Orthodox Church Serbs, Montenegrins and Macedonians the Catholic Church Croats and Slovenes and Islam Bosnian Muslims and Albanians . The religious diversity deepened the divisions within Yugoslav society. Serbs and Montenegrins made up 38.8 per cent of the population, Croats contributed 23.9 per cent, Slovenes 8.5 per cent, Bosnian Muslims 6.3 per cent, Macedonians 5.3 per cent, and Albanians 4 per cent. According to economics professor and historian Jozo Tomasevich, Yugoslavia was politically weak from the moment of its creation and remained so during the interwar period mainly due to a rigid system of centralism imposed by the Serb friendly Vidovdan Constitution, the aforementioned strong association between each national group and its dominant religion, and uneven economic development. In particular, the religious primacy of the Serbian Orthodox Church in national affairs and discrimination against Catholics and Muslims compounded the dissatisfaction of the non Serb population with the Serb dominated ruling groups that controlled patronage and government appointments, and treated non Serbs as second class citizens. This centralised system arose from Serbian military strength and Croat intransigence, and was sustained by Croat disengagement, Serb overrepresentation, corruption and a lack of discipline within political parties. This state of affairs was initially maintained by subverting the democratic system of government through political bribery. The domination of the rest of Yugoslavia by Serb ruling elites meant that the country was never consolidated in the political sense, and was therefore never able to address the social and economic challenges it faced. Political scientist Professor Sabrina P. Ramet sees the dysfunctionality and lack of legitimacy of the regime as the reasons why the kingdom's internal politics became ethnically polarised, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the national question in Yugoslavia. Failures to establish the rule of law, to protect individual rights, to build tolerance and equality, and to guarantee the neutrality of the state in matters relating to religion, language and culture contributed to this illegitimacy and the resulting instability. In 1929, democracy was abandoned and a royal dictatorship was established by King Alexander, who attempted to break down the ethnic divisions in the country through various means, including creating administrative divisions Serbo Croatian Latin banovine based on rivers rather than traditional regions. There was significant opposition to this move, with Serb and Slovene opposition parties and figures advocating the division of Yugoslavia into six ethnically based administrative units. By 1933, discontent in the largely Croat populated Sava Banovina had developed into full blown civil disorder, which the regime countered with a series of assassinations, attempted assassinations and arrests of key Croat opposition figures including the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party Serbo Croatian Latin Hrvatska seljacka stranka, HSS Vladko Macek. When Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles in 1934 by a Bulgarian assassin with links to the Croat ultranationalists, the Ustase, his cousin Prince Paul headed a triumvirate regency whose other members were the senator Radenko Stankovic and the governor of the Sava Banovina, Ivo Perovic. The regency ruled on behalf of Alexander's 11 year old son, Prince Peter, but the important member of the regency was Prince Paul. Although Prince Paul was more liberal than his cousin, the dictatorship continued uninterrupted. The dictatorship had allowed the country to follow a consistent foreign policy, but Yugoslavia needed peace at home in order to assure peace with its neighbours, all of whom had irredentist designs on its territory. From 1921, the country had negotiated the Little Entente with Romania and Czechoslovakia in the face of Hungarian designs on its territory, and after a decade of bilateral treaties, had formalised the arrangements in 1933. This had been followed the next year by the Balkan Entente of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, aimed at thwarting Bulgarian aspirations. Throughout this period, the Yugoslav government had sought to remain good friends with France, seeing her as a guarantor of European peace treaties. This was formalised through a treaty of friendship signed in 1927. With these arrangements in place, Italy posed the biggest problem for Yugoslavia, funding the anti Yugoslav Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation which promoted Bulgarian irredentism. Attempts by King Alexander to negotiate with Benito Mussolini fell on deaf ears, and after Alexander's assassination, nothing of note happened on that front until 1937. In the aftermath of Alexander's assassination, Yugoslavia was isolated both militarily and diplomatically, and reached out to France to assist its bilateral relationship with Italy. With the appointment of Milan Stojadinovic as Prime Minister in 1935, Germany and Yugoslavia became more closely aligned. The trade relationship between the two countries also developed considerably, and Germany became Yugoslavia's most important trading partner. Prince Paul recognised the lack of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Macek, the leader of the dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Stojadinovic met with Macek at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinovic was unwilling or unable to grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force VVKJ commander, General Dusan Simovic, had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election. In the December 1938 elections, the United Opposition led by Macek had attracted 44.9 per cent of the vote, but due to the electoral rules by which the government parties received 40 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly before votes were counted, the opposition vote only translated into 67 seats out of a total of 373. On 3 February 1939, the Minister of Education, Bogoljub Kujundzic, made a nationalist speech in the Assembly in which he stated that Serb policies will always be the policies of this house and this government. Head of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization JMO Mehmed Spaho asked Stojadinovic to disavow the statement, but he did not. At the behest of the Senate leader, the Slovene Anton Korosec, that evening five ministers resigned from the government, including Korosec. The others were Spaho, another JMO politician Dzafer Kulenovic, the Slovene Franc Snoj, and the Serb Dragisa Cvetkovic. Stojadinovic sought authority from Prince Paul to form a new cabinet, but Korosec as head of the Senate advised the prince to form a new government around Cvetkovic. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinovic and appointed Cvetkovic in his place, with a direction that he reach an agreement with Macek. While these negotiations were ongoing, Italy invaded Albania, Yugoslavia's southern neighbour. In August 1939, the CvetkovicMacek Agreement was concluded to create the Banovina of Croatia, which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did not go far enough, and many Serbs believed it went too far in giving power to Croats. The Cvetkovic led cabinet formed in the wake of the Agreement was resolutely anti Axis, but remained on friendly terms with Germany, and included five members of the HSS, with Macek as deputy Prime Minister. General Milan Nedic was Minister of the Army and Navy. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid 1940 of the Minister of the Interior, Stanoje Mihaldzic, who had been organising covert anti Axis activities. In October 1940, Simovic was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non committal. From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador Ronald Campbell apparently still believed possible. By the time of the German invasion of Poland and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with British intelligence agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the Anschluss. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities. In mid to late 1940, British intelligence became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side track the plans, preferring to continue working through Prince Paul. The Special Operations Executive SOE office in Belgrade went to significant lengths to support the opposition to the anti Axis Cvetkovic government, which undermined the hard won balance in Yugoslav politics that that government represented. SOE Belgrade was entangled with pro Serb policies and interests, and disregarded or underestimated warnings from SOE and British diplomats in Zagreb, who better understood the situation in Yugoslavia as a whole. Yugoslavia's situation worsened in October 1940 when Italy invaded Greece from Albania, and the initial failure of the Italians to make headway only increased Yugoslav apprehension that Germany would be forced to help Italy. In September and November 1940 respectively, Germany forced the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Romania to accede to the Tripartite Pact. In early November 1940, Nedic, who believed that Germany would win the war, proposed to the government that it abandon its neutral stance and join the Axis as soon as possible in the hope that Germany would protect Yugoslavia against its greedy neighbors . A few days later Prince Paul, having realised the impossibility of following Nedic's advice, replaced him with the ageing and compliant General Petar Pesic. At the same time, Hitler, recalling Serbia's excellent military performance in the Balkan Wars and World War I, was concerned that the Yugoslav army was strong, and defeating it would necessitate the expenditure of considerable effort. Despite this, he remained concerned about the threat to the southern flank of his planned invasion of the Soviet Union posed by Greece and Yugoslavia, and aimed for a political resolution of Yugoslavia's status. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister of Hungary, Count Pal Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and non aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not. Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. Over the next few months, Prince Paul and his ministers laboured under overwhelming diplomatic pressure, a threat of an attack by the Germans from Bulgarian territory, and the unwillingness of the British to promise practical military support. Six months prior to the coup, British policy towards the government of Yugoslavia had shifted from acceptance of Yugoslav neutrality to pressuring the country for support in the war against Germany. On 23 January 1941, William Donovan, a special emissary of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, visited Belgrade and issued an ultimatum, saying that if Yugoslavia permitted German troop passage then the US would not interfere on her behalf at peace talks. Around the same time, suspicious of Prince Paul's actions, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered British intelligence services to establish contacts with anti regime groups in Belgrade. On 14 February, Adolf Hitler met with Cvetkovic and his foreign minister and requested Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact. He pushed for the demobilisation of the Royal Yugoslav Armythere had been a partial reactivation a euphemism for mobilisation in Macedonia and parts of Serbia, probably directed at the Italians. Hitler also pressed the Yugoslavs to permit the transportation of German supplies through Yugoslavia's territory, along with greater economic cooperation. In exchange he offered a port near the Aegean Sea and territorial security. On 17 February, Bulgaria and Turkey signed an agreement of friendship and non aggression, which effectively destroyed attempts to create a neutral Balkan bloc. Prince Paul denounced the agreement and the Bulgarians, describing their actions as perfidy . On 18 and 23 February, Prince Paul told the US Ambassador Arthur Lane that Yugoslavia would not engage the German military if they entered Bulgaria. He explained that to do so would be wrongful and that it would not be understood by the Slovenes and Croats. On 1 March, Yugoslavia was further isolated when Bulgaria signed the Pact and the German army arrived at the Bulgarian Yugoslav border. On 4 March, Prince Paul secretly met with Hitler in Berchtesgaden and was again pressured to sign the Pact. Hitler did not request troop passage through Yugoslavia and offered the Greek city of Salonika. A time limit for Prince Paul, who was uncommitted and wavering , was not set. Prince Paul, in the middle of a cabinet crisis, offered a nonaggression pact and a declaration of friendship, but Hitler insisted on his proposals. Prince Paul warned that I fear that if I follow your advice and sign the Tripartite Pact I shall no longer be here in six months. On 8 March, Franz Halder, the German Chief of the Army General Staff, expressed his expectation that the Yugoslavs would sign if German troops did not cross their border. During March, secret treaty negotiations commenced in Moscow between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, represented respectively by the Yugoslav ambassador, Milan Gavrilovic, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov. According to General Pavel Sudoplatov, who was at the time the deputy chief of special operations for the NKVD, the Soviet internal affairs ministry, Gavrilovic was a fully recruited Soviet agent, but Sudoplatov states that they knew that Gavrilovic also had ties with the British. The Yugoslavs initially sought a military alliance, but this was rejected by the Soviet side, as they were already bound by the 1939 MolotovRibbentrop Pact which guaranteed non belligerence with Germany. On 17 March, Prince Paul returned to Berchtesgaden and was told by Hitler that it was his last chance for Yugoslavia to join the Pact, renouncing this time the request for the use of Yugoslav railways in order to facilitate their accession. Two days later, Prince Paul convened a Crown Council to discuss the terms of the Pact and whether Yugoslavia should sign it. The Council's members were willing to agree, but only under the condition that Germany let its concessions be made public. Germany agreed and the Council approved the terms. Three cabinet ministers resigned on 20 March in protest of the impending signing of the Pact. These were the Minister of the Interior, Srdjan Budisavljevic the Minister of Agriculture, Branko Cubrilovic and the Minister without Portfolio, Mihailo Konstantinovic. The British were friendly with Budisavljevic, and his resignation at British urging precipitated the resignations of the other two. The Germans reacted by imposing an ultimatum to accept by midnight 23 March or forfeit any further chances. Prince Paul and Cvetkovic obliged and accepted, despite believing German promises were worthless . On 23 March, Germany's guarantee of Yugoslavia's territorial security and its promise not to use its railroads were publicised. In the United Kingdom, Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, penned in his diary that the Yugoslavs seem to have sold their souls to the Devil. All these Balkan peoples are trash. On 25 March, the pact was signed at the Belvedere palace in Vienna. An official banquet was held which Hitler complained felt like a funeral party. German radio later announced that the Axis Powers would not demand the right of passage of troops or war materials, while the official document mentioned only troops and omitted mention of war materials. Likewise the pledge to give Salonika to Yugoslavia does not appear on the document. In Athens, Allied planners were dismayed by the Yugoslav signing of the Pact, as it represented a worst case scenario for the defence of Greece. On the following day, Serb demonstrators gathered on the streets of Belgrade shouting Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact Serbo Croatian Latin Bolje grob nego rob, Bolje rat nego pakt . The coup was executed at 2 15 am on 27 March. It was planned by a group of VVKJ officers in Zemun, and Royal Guard officers in nearby Belgrade. The only senior officers involved were from the air force. Under the supervision of the VVKJ deputy commander Borivoje Mirkovic, headquartered at the VVKJ base at Zemun, officers assumed control of critical buildings and locations in the early hours of 27 March, including An inspector of post, telegraph and telephone assisted Mirkovic by cutting off communications between Belgrade and the rest of the country. Tanks and artillery were deployed on all the main streets of Belgrade, and by 2 00 pm all strategic locations were in the hands of troops loyal to the coup leaders. At the time of the coup, Prince Paul was in Zagreb en route to a planned holiday in Brdo. On the morning of 27 March, Deputy Prime Minister Macek was informed of the coup and met Prince Paul at Zagreb's railway station to discuss the situation. A meeting was then held at the residence of the Ban of Croatia, Ivan Subasic, which included Subasic, Prince Paul, Macek and the army commander in Zagreb, August Maric. Macek urged Prince Paul to oppose the putsch and Maric pledged the support of the Croatian units of the army. Macek suggested that Prince Paul stay in Zagreb, with the possibility of mobilising army units in the Banovina of Croatia in his support. Prince Paul declined this offer, at least partially because his wife, Princess Olga, and children remained in Belgrade. Accompanied by Subasic, he reached the capital by train that evening and was met by Simovic, who took him to the war ministry where he and the other two regents relinquished power, immediately abolishing the regency. Having already made arrangements with the British consul in Zagreb, Prince Paul and his family left that evening for Greece, after which they travelled to Kenya and then exile in South Africa. On the morning of 27 March, the royal palace was surrounded and the coup's advocates issued a radio message that impersonated the voice of King Peter with a proclamation to the people , calling on them to support the King. Peter was surprised by the coup, and heard of his coming of age for the first time on the radio. Pamphlets with the proclamation of the coup were subsequently dropped into cities from aircraft. Demonstrations followed in Belgrade and other large Yugoslav cities that continued for the next few days, including in Cetinje, Podgorica, Split, Skopje and Kragujevac. The crowds at these demonstrations shouted slogans in support of the United Kingdom, and also frequently used the slogan that had been used by demonstrators the day before the coup, Better the war than the pact, better the grave than a slave . Members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which had been outlawed since 1920, also took part in pro putsch rallies all over the country. Churchill declared that Yugoslavia has found its soul, and he even considered that a Balkan front could be established with Turkish help. The news resulted in Greek attempts to change their defence plans, and the Greeks also pressed the Yugoslavs to attack the Italians in Albania. The Polish and Czechoslovakian governments in exile both praised the coup, and news of it was received in Greece with wild enthusiasm . According to the memoirs of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch, Gavrilo V, the putsch was immediately welcomed by the senior clergy of the church, as the Holy Assembly of Bishops convened on 27 March in response to the coup. Patriarch Gavrilo also spoke publicly in support of the King and the new regime over the radio. King Peter II was inaugurated in the presence of Patriarch Gavrilo on 28 March. For other nations in Yugoslavia, the prospect of war and the government's close ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church was not at all appealing. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, president of the Roman Catholic Conference of Bishops of Yugoslavia, bitterly wrote in his diary that, All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds... that will never move closer to one another without an act of God . He also wrote, The Schism is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. There is no morality, no principle, there is no truth, no justice, no honesty . On the same day, he publicly called on the Catholic clergy to pray for King Peter and that Croatia and Yugoslavia would be spared a war. The coup resulted in only one death, which was accidental. There are contradictory claims as to who was the leader of the coup, coming from Simovic, Mirkovic, and Zivan Knezevic. Mirkovic claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that Only after I had informed General about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place. It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the younger and middle ranks of the Yugoslav army for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. In 1951, Mirkovic stated that he had been considering a putsch since 1938, and had discussed the idea quite openly with a significant number of generals, including Milan Nedic. He went on to say that he had offered the lead role in the post coup government to a number of prominent people, including Milan Nedic the governor of the Morava Banovina, Janicije Krasojevic the commander of the Royal Guard, General Aleksandar Stankovic General Bogoljub Ilic and Simovic. Nedic and Krasojevic refused as they felt they could not take an active part due to their positions, Stankovic promised not to use the Royal Guard against the people and to keep his knowledge of the plot secret, Ilic did not think he had the political influence to perform the role, and Simovic agreed. Simovic's response to Mirkovic's claims was published posthumously. Simovic claimed that he stood in the center of the whole undertaking and personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirkovic for the action . Tomasevich considers Mirkovic's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon to be Yugoslav government in exile during the war. According to former British diplomat and Emeritus Professor of History, Classics and Archaeology of the University of Edinburgh David A. T. Stafford, writing in 1977, although supported with British intelligence and encouragement, the nitiative came from the Yugoslavs, and only by a stretch of the imagination can the British be said to have planned or directed the coup d'etat. Radoje Knezevic vehemently denied any British involvement at all in a series of published letters between himself and Stafford, until in 1979, Stafford apologised for his error and for any offence caused to Radoje Knezevic. In 1999, Ivo Tasovac criticised Stafford's revised conclusion, pointing to evidence that the plotters were dependent on British intelligence, and that senior British officials met with both Simovic and Mirkovic immediately before the coup was carried out. The British air attache Group Captain A. H. H. McDonald met with Simovic on 26 March, and the assistant air attache and British intelligence agent T. G. Mappleback met with his close friend Mirkovic on the same day and told him that the coup had to be carried out within the next 48 hours. According to the historian Marta Iaremko, writing in 2014, the vast majority of researchers consider that the putsch was planned with the assistance of the British intelligence services, but that this, and their encouragement of the revolt, were not sufficient to ensure it was carried out. According to Sudoplatov, the coup was actively supported by Soviet military intelligence GRU and the NKVD, following the Soviet leader Joseph Stalins instructions, with a view to strengthening the USSRs strategic position in the Balkans. A group of Soviet intelligence officers that included Major General Solomon Milshtein and Vasily Zarubin was sent to Belgrade to assist in the coup. The activities of the USSR in Yugoslavia had been boosted by the establishment of a Soviet mission in Belgrade in 1940 the Soviet Union had been developing its intelligence network through left wing journalists and academics at the University of Belgrade. The German embassy in Belgrade was certain that the coup had been organised by British and Soviet intelligence agencies. Individuals that were probably aware of the coup included Slobodan Jovanovic, president of the Serbian Cultural Club, and Ilija Trifunovic Bircanin, president of Narodna Odbrana National Defence . Some of those urging a coup or at least aware that a coup was planned had previously been involved with secretive Black Handers, including Bozin Simic. Mirkovic himself had been a student of the leading Black Hand operative, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevic also known as Apis , while training at the Serbian Military Academy. Those that favoured the coup included the older generation of generals, including the former prime minister Petar Zivkovic and his brother Dimitrije Zivkovic, intellectuals, leftist students, the opposition, the army and army air force, and the Orthodox Church. The generals had various reasons for disliking Prince Paul, including being placed on the retired or reserve lists, postings to lesser roles to prevent them from engaging in politics, and aversion to Prince Paul's policies. In the wake of the coup, Simovic's new government refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly rule it out. Hitler, angered by the coup and anti German incidents in Belgrade, gathered his senior officers and ordered that Yugoslavia be crushed without delay. In particular, Hitler was concerned about the British Royal Air Force using bases in Greece and Yugoslavia to conduct air attacks against the southern flank of the pending attack on the Soviet Union. On the same day as the coup he issued Fuhrer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state. Italy was to be included in the operations and the directive made specific mention that fforts will be made to induce Hungary and Bulgaria to take part in operations by offering them the prospect of regaining Banat and Macedonia . Furthermore, the directive stated that nternal tensions in Yugoslavia will be encouraged by giving political assurances to the Croats , taking account of their dissatisfaction with their position in pre war Yugoslavia. Later, Hitler stated that the coup had been a shock. At the same time he ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia, Hitler postponed the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, by about four weeks from its original date of 15 May. Up to this point, the need for some delay due to the particularly wet spring in eastern Europe may have been foreseen, but the timing indicates that the unexpected need to defeat Yugoslavia was an important factor in Hitler's decision. On 30 March, Foreign Minister Momcilo Nincic summoned the German ambassador, Viktor von Heeren, and handed him a statement which declared that the new government would accept all its international obligations, including accession to the Tripartite Pact, as long as the national interests of the country were protected. For his part, Heeren demanded an apology for the anti German demonstrations, immediate ratification of the Tripartite Pact, and demobilisation of the Yugoslav armed forces. Heeren returned to his office to discover a message from Berlin instructing that contact with Yugoslav officials was to be avoided, and he was recalled to Berlin, departing the following day. No reply was given to Nincic. On 2 April, orders were issued for the evacuation of the German embassy, which occurred the next day, and the German charge d'affaires advised the diplomats of friendly countries to leave the country. Heeren tried to assure Hitler that the putsch was an internal matter between Yugoslav political elites, and that action against Yugoslavia was unnecessary, but he was ignored. On 31 March, after offering Croatia to Hungary and being rebuffed, the Germans had decided to give Croatia its independence. The German media simultaneously launched a barrage of accusations against Yugoslavia, claiming that German nationals in Yugoslavia had been subjected to atrocities, similar to the propaganda issued prior to the invasions of Poland and Czechoslovakia. This media onslaught also attempted to exploit divisions between Serbs and Croats, by pledging that the latter would have a prominent role in the country in the future. Thousands of German nationals left Yugoslavia on instructions from Berlin. On 3 April, Fuhrer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the Romania Yugoslav border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb in preparation for a regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force, also defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's air defences. Simovic named Macek as Deputy Prime Minister once again in the new government, but Macek was reluctant and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the CvetkovicMacek Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. He also demanded that four Croat politicians from the deposed cabinet be part of the new one, to which Simovic agreed. On 4 April, Macek travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post on several conditions that the new government respect the CvetkovicMacek Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustase leader Ante Pavelic called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy. On 5 April the new cabinet met for the first time. While the first two conditions set by Macek were met, the appointment of regents was impracticable given Prince Peter had been declared to be of age. Involving representatives from across the political spectrum, Simovic's cabinet was extremely disunited and weak . It quickly realised that it had to embrace a foreign policy that bore a strong resemblance that that of the preceding administration. Budisavljevic and Cubrilovic, along with the four HSS politicians, were re instated to cabinet. It included members who fell into three groups those who were strongly opposed to the Axis and prepared to face war with Germany, those who advocated peace with Germany, and those that were uncommitted. The groups were divided as follows On 5 April 1941, the post coup government signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non Aggression with the Soviet Union in Moscow, for which talks had been underway since March. The relevant final article of the treaty read as follows In the event of aggression against one of the contracting parties on the part of a third power, the other contracting party undertakes to observe a policy of friendly relations towards that party, which fell short of a commitment to provide military assistance. Stalin's intention by entering into the treaty was to signal to Hitler that the Soviet Union had interests in the Balkans, while not antagonising his erstwhile ally. For this reason, Soviet military intervention in Yugoslavia was never considered. According to Tomasevich, this was an almost meaningless diplomatic move , which could have had no real impact on the situation in which Yugoslavia found herself. Even within the Royal Yugoslav Army, divisions between a Croat Slovene pro Axis faction and a Serb pro Allied faction emerged. The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April. The bombing of Belgrade forced the government to seek shelter outside the city. From here, King Peter and Simovic planned to leave for exile. Macek, refusing to leave the country, resigned on 7 April and designated Juraj Krnjevic as his successor. Macek returned to Zagreb. Three other ministers also refused to leave Yugoslavia Ivan Andres and Barisa Smoljan of the HSS and Kulenovic of the JMO. The government met on Yugoslav soil for the last time on 13 April near Pale. From here they travelled to Niksic where they were flown out of the country to Athens. The Soviet leadership accepted the invasion of Yugoslavia without any criticism. Another result of the coup was that the work that had been done by British intelligence with the anti Axis government of Cvetkovic and Macek was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the CvetkovicMacek Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government in exile during the rest of the war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the CvetkovicMacek Agreement. Other than the dispute over who could take credit for staging the coup, the event itself and the dismal showing of the Yugoslav armed forces during the invasion were extensively analysed and discussed by participants, Yugoslav and foreign scholars, and other figures, both during and after the war. It remained a source of pride for the most outspoken Serbian nationalists and politicians from the Serb ruling groups that supported it. Those that had advanced a policy of accommodation with the Axis maintained that had the coup not occurred, Yugoslavia would have been able to remain neutral and would have therefore escaped invasion and the many other consequences, including the large number of deaths and widespread destruction during the war, and the victory of the communist led Yugoslav Partisans and the creation of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia as a socialist state. The proponents of accommodation also considered that Yugoslavia might have been able to enter the war on the Allied side at a later time and with less sacrifice. The KPJ saw the coup and invasion as a trigger for the wider revolt which resulted in its ultimate victory, and this aspect was commemorated each year in post war Yugoslavia. In the final analysis, the primary significance of the coup was that it placed Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact into doubt, which led directly to the Axis invasion. Tomasevich concurs with the KPJ evaluation that the coup and the resulting invasion were the starting point for the successful communist led revolution. According to the British major general and historian I. S. O. Playfair, the coup was essentially a brave gesture of defiance, mainly by Serbs, against the German domination signified by signing of the Tripartite Pact, undertaken in the full knowledge that invasion would likely follow. It was also, according to the historian Alexander Prusin, an utter blunder, based on wishful thinking and emotions rather than a realistic appreciation of the country's limited economic and military potential . By overthrowing Prince Paul and the Cvetkovic government who had sought accommodation with the Croats, the coup also operationalised Serb opposition to the Cvetkovic Macek Agreement. Further, it underlined the lack of unity between Serbs and Croats, which limited the military options available to the Yugoslav government. Hitler's decision to invade Yugoslavia delayed the concurrent invasion of Greece by five days, but this was more than made up for by the advantages of being able to invade Greece via southern Yugoslavia, allowing the outflanking of the Aliakmon Line. The role of the coup and subsequent invasion of Yugoslavia in delaying Operation Barbarossa, and the subsequent Axis defeat by the Soviet Union, is disputed. In 1975, Tomasevich wrote that the events in Yugoslavia were a partial cause of what proved to be a fateful delay in Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union , and went on to state that many writers consider that this delay was responsible for the German failure to capture Moscow in the winter of 19411942. He acknowledged that, apart from the coup and invasion, the wet spring of 1941 contributed a two or three week delay to the launching of Barbarossa, but saw the delay caused by events in Yugoslavia as an important indirect factor in eventual Axis defeat in the war. This position was also advanced by William L. Shirer in 1990. More recently, Antony Beevor wrote that most accept that the Balkan campaign made little difference to the eventual outcome of Barbarossa. Sue Onslow, in a bid to place the coup in the broader context of the British policy towards Yugoslavia between the outbreak of the Second World War and the events on 27 March 1941, writes that the coup was a major propaganda victory for Britain, as it proved a tremendous, if ephemeral, boost to British morale, coming rapidly upon the victories against Italian forces in North Africa and the Sudan it also was a much needed fillip to the 'upstart'... Special Operations Executive created by Dalton . Prince Paul was found guilty of war crimes in September 1945 for his role in the Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact. In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence to be politically and ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated. A similar decision had been made in 2009 to rehabilitate Cvetkovic for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat
"The Yukon Field Force, later termed the Yukon Garrison, was a unit of 203 officers and men from the Permanent Force of the Canadian Militia that served in the Yukon between 1898 and 1900. The force was created in the wake of the Klondike Gold Rush in response to fears that the United States might attempt to seize the region. It left Ottawa on May 6 1898, travelling by rail and sea to the port of Glenora in British Columbia. From there, the unit made an arduous journey of 890 kilometres 550 mi on foot and using makeshift boats to Fort Selkirk, where they established their headquarters. A detachment of 72 men was sent to the boom town of Dawson City to support the North West Mounted Police, with duties that included guarding the gold deposits of the local banks. As the fears of an annexation reduced, pressures grew for the recall of the force. The force was halved in size in July 1898 and the remainder were finally withdrawn in June 1900. The Yukon Field Force was created in response to the discovery of gold in the Canadian far north in the final years of the 19th century. There was no government presence in the Yukon in the late 19th century and the region was sparsely populated by First Nations and European prospectors. The borders in south east Alaska had been disputed between the United States, Canada and Britain since the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There were no police in the region, and the Permanent Force of the Canadian Militia was only around 800 strong across the whole of the country, with the nearest garrison in Winnipeg, Manitoba, approximately 3,800 kilometres 2,400 mi away. Gold began to be discovered along the valleys, however, and by 1894 the growing population and development of gold mining at Forty Mile had led to calls from religious and business leaders for Ottawa to intervene to control whiskey trading, protect the local First Nations and gather customs duties. The government surveyor William Ogilvie warned Ottawa that it was necessary to introduce Canadian government quickly to the region if a United States takeover was to be avoided. In response, the North West Mounted Police carried out a survey along the Yukon River, establishing a barracks there in 1875. In 1896, huge amounts of gold were discovered in the Klondike valley, prompting an international gold rush. Local miners streamed from Forty Mile to the new town of Dawson and, once word got out to the wider world the next year, around 100,000 more rushed to the region in search of gold. Although no more than 40,000 successfully reached the Klondike, an estimated 60 to 80 percent of these newcomers came from the United States. The mounted police deployed to the region in increasing strength, in part due to concerns that the United States might take the opportunity to annex the Klondike. The first suggestion that a military force should be sent to the Yukon came from Nathaniel Wallace, who put forward the idea in Parliament in February 1898. The government worked up the proposal into a formal plan, which was confirmed through an Order in Council on March 21. Frederick Borden, the Minister of Militia and Defence, announced in May that a 200 strong force would be deployed to Fort Selkirk, the nominal capital of the territory, to reinforce the mounted police. One of the arguments put forward in favour of this option was that it was much cheaper than sending additional police, who enjoyed higher pay than soldiers. In addition to its primary role in maintaining Canadian sovereignty, Borden stated that the force would, if necessary, assist in maintaining law and order. The 203 strong force consisted of 12 commissioned officers, 15 men from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, 46 men from the Royal Canadian Artillery and 130 men from the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry. The force was formed up by asking for volunteers from the Permanent Force, who were told that the task would last at least two years the detachment proved popular, with many soldiers putting themselves forward for it and, if necessary, extending their terms of service. It was commanded by acting Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Evans, a well regarded officer based in Winnipeg, who had a background in managing cavalry, infantry and artillery. The force was equipped with LeeEnfield rifles, two Maxim guns, and two 7 pounder 3 kg guns, one brass and the other steel, and took along sixty horses for transport. The soldiers were issued with special heavy black pea jackets and trousers and other cold weather clothing for the winter months, along with their regular field and garrison uniforms. Their hastily purchased supplies included 123,000 kilograms 271,000 lb of tinned meat, biscuits and flour. The soldiers were accompanied by nine artificers including boat builders and packers and eleven civil servants. The expedition was also joined by four nurses, dispatched by the Victorian Order of Nurses to work in the Yukon the wife of a mounted police officer who was travelling to join her husband and Faith Fenton, a journalist sent by the Toronto Globe to cover the force's journey. By 1898, there were various ways to reach the remote Yukon region from eastern Canada, but most required that travellers passed through some United States territory along the way, either when coming by boat across western Alaska along the Yukon River, or when crossing the mountain ranges in the south east. This situation had aroused nationalistic concern in Canada and some routes had therefore been identified that avoided entering the United States altogether, known as the All Canadian routes . It was regarded as politically essential that the Yukon Field Force use one of these, and this was reinforced by practical concerns that the slower Yukon River route might take the expedition too long to complete, potentially stranding the force in the wilderness if its waters froze early. After leaving by rail from Ottawa on May 6 bound for Vancouver, the force was therefore split into two. The men and 80 metric tons 79 long tons 88 short tons of essential supplies would travel to the river head at Wrangell, then up the Stikine River on the Stikine Chief, making use of Canada's navigational rights and avoiding landing in United States territory, before travelling overland and along the river network towards Fort Selkirk. The remaining 100 metric tons 98 long tons 110 short tons of the supplies and the artillery would be sent via St Michael in Alaska and from there by steamer through to Dawson City. Having landed at the port of Glenora in British Columbia on May 20, the main force marched overland to Telegraph Creek, where the 250 kilometre 160 mi long Teslin Trail began. The force was broken down into 35 man teams for the march, with an advance party of 50 men sent on ahead to improve the trail and advance quickly using a steamer on to Fort Selkirk to begin rebuilding it. The journey over the rugged terrain was arduous, and Thomas Evans noted the suffering caused by the heat, swamps and mosquitos, observing that his men had nothing to eat but hard biscuits, rancid strong bacon and black tea . They each carried heavy packs, as the local contractors had failed to supply them with sufficient mules to transport their supplies. When the force reached the end of the trail at Teslin Lake, Evans left aboard a steamer with a detachment of 80 men to join the team at Fort Selkirk, but the boat hit a rock while coming back to pick up the remainder of the men. The force instead sailed across the lake using four scows and five smaller row boats they had built from local trees, having originally intended to use them to carry their supplies. The scows were 14 metres 46 ft long and could carry 15 metric tons 15 long tons 17 short tons of cargo and 30 men they had sails, and were fitted with a stove for cooking. They finally arrived in Fort Selkirk on September 11, having covered another 640 kilometres 400 mi from Teslin Lake. A small detachment of mounted police were already stationed at Fort Selkirk to monitor the river traffic, and the advance team of the force had been working with contractors to make good progress on the new garrison buildings. The combined force completed the work, creating a compound of eleven log buildings around a central parade ground. Although the headquarters of the force remained at Fort Selkirk, over the course of October and November 1898, 72 men and one of the Maxim guns were sent to Dawson City to support the mounted police. The Dawson detachment protected the gold held by the various banks in the town, guarded prisoners, helped to construct local hospitals, and took part in fighting fires the town was built from wood and particularly vulnerable to conflagration. They also carried out some ceremonial duties. The Fort Selkirk garrison was considered to be quite isolated and men were moved between the two sites over the winter to reduce the boredom. During the warmer months of 1899, weekly military exercises were carried out by the force and a rifle range was constructed. By 1899, the risk of annexation had passed and General Edward Hutton, the new General Officer Commanding Canadian Militia, was unhappy with the role of the Yukon Field Force. He argued that it was inappropriately employed in support of civil tasks, and that having so many regular soldiers deployed there was harming the Permanent Force's ability to train the rest of the militia. As a result, half the force was withdrawn in July 1899 and returned to Canada, this time travelling via the faster route of White Pass and Skagway through United States' territory. In October, war broke out between Britain and the Boer Republics in South Africa Canada raised a force to deploy in support of the British. Thomas Evans was withdrawn from the Yukon in November to join the effort, and was replaced as the force's commander by Major T. Hemming. In May 1900, the force left Fort Selkirk and focused solely on Dawson. On June 25, the remainder of the force was withdrawn on the advice of the Minister of Militia, again returning via White Pass and Skagway. Their uniforms, rifles and Maxim guns remained behind and were later reused by the volunteer militia Dawson Rifle Company, formed the following year, while the artillery was given to the mounted police. The mounted police continued their presence at Fort Selkirk, making use of the force's former barracks until 1911. Three buildings built by the force survive at Fort Selkirk the officers' residence and the former guard room, which were moved to new locations on the site by a local man called Alex Coward in the 1920s and known today as Coward Cabin and the Garage , and the orderly room, which remains in its original location. The Yukon Field Force cemetery, where three soldiers and some members of the local community are buried, is located nearby. The force's two 7 pounder guns are on display at the offices of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Dawson City.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon%20Field%20Force
"Yummy is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani, featuring American musician Pharrell Williams, from her second solo studio album, The Sweet Escape 2006 . The track was released on November 11, 2006 as a promotional single for the parent album's release through Interscope Records. It was developed during several sessions in Miami, Florida, and Hollywood, California, in July 2005, for an intended EP or as extra tracks on her video album Harajuku Lovers Live 2005 . The song was written by Stefani and Williams and produced by The Neptunes. Musically, the collaboration is a dance pop recording with a day glo rap. Its lyrics deal with food, sexual intercourse, and the roles that an individual may have within a household. Yummy divided music critics, with some praising its minimalistic production, leaving others to find it too simple, in addition to criticizing its lyrics. It was often compared to Kelis' 2003 hit single Milkshake . The track was performed during Stefani's The Sweet Escape Tour in 2006, where she entered the stage alongside two keyboard musicians. More recently, the singer sang a rendition of it as part of a melody, known as the Harajuku Medley , during her MasterCard Priceless Surprises promotional events in 2015 and 2016. After the release of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. in 2004, Stefani originally intended to return to No Doubt and start recording tracks for their upcoming and untitled sixth studio album, which would later become Push and Shove 2012 . Instead, Pharrell Williams convinced her to record several more songs in Miami, Florida and Hollywood, California in July 2005, for a possible extended play EP or as bonus tracks on her live album Harajuku Lovers Live. Wind It Up and Orange County Girl were re recorded after being originally featured during Stefani's 2004 Harajuku Lovers Tour, while tracks U Started It , Breakin' Up , Candyland , and Yummy were developed for the singer's second album. On November 11, 2006, Yummy was released as the record's promotional single in a CD single and 12 inch format, with both containing the instrumental, an a cappella version, and either the radio edit or album version. In an interview with the Billboard in January 2014, where Stefani discussed her then upcoming third studio album, she stated that Yummy was among her favorites from her discography. She also revealed that she had wanted Yummy to be released as a commercial single Those lyrics are crazy. I listen to that like, 'What was she doing ' Pharrell's just so creative, I remember back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else ' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get so many things that people hear. Yummy was written by Stefani and Pharrell Williams, while The Neptunes handled the track's production. Its style can be described as dance pop that contains a day glo rap. As described by Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork, the song mov from a skeletal rhythmic backbone and resound 'Milkshake' pitching triangle into a spiraling melody line that sounds like a Sherman Brothers outtake . Writing for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani also compared it to Kelis' 2003 single Milkshake , and stated it finally gives a name to Pharrell's percussive minimalism . The recording opens with a subdued, subtle and quiet atmosphere , while the outro consists of scary and demented circus music , which serves as a voyage into a mechanic's shop . Stefani discusses roles of a homemaker in the lyrics, singing I know you've been waiting but I've been out making babies and Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes It's time to make you sweat . Food imagery is continually mentioned in its lyrics, which Quentin B. Huff, writing for PopMatters, saw as an imitation of Milkshake . The chorus consists of a serious and repetitive coo, where she sings I'm feeling yummy head to toe . Upon release, the song received generally mixed reviews. Pytlik of Pitchfork applauded Yummy by calling it the Best Song on the parent album. Slant's Cinquemani complimented Williams' minimalistic production on the track, and believed that it would have made a far less divisive choice for a first single , referring to Wind It Up being the lead single from The Sweet Escape. Christina Fuoco Karasinski from the former website LiveDaily enjoyed the song, calling it delicious . Scott M. Baldwin from Sputnikmusic was mixed in his review of the parent album and stated that Yummy is one of the dumbest sex songs ever written . He disliked the singer's lyrics as well, calling them the worst lyrics Stefani has written , but praised Williams' production, calling it just fantastic and a brilliant contrast . Amanda Murray from the same website also was mixed, calling it random bullshit friendly . Robert Christgau labeled the song as a choice cut , signifying that it is a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money . Alex Miller from NME disapproved, claiming that the clueless Fergie possesses Stefani for ... the woefully oddball 'Yummy' , while Norman Mayers from Prefix opined that it was bizarre . While comparing the five The Neptunes produced tracks on the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found it to be rather embarrassing and cloying and crass , rather than effortless and effervescent . Lucy Davies, writing for BBC Music, described it as a bland filler that sums her up coquettish, amusing, annoying and hip wiggling in equal measure . Stefani included the song on the setlist for her 2006 world concert tour entitled The Sweet Escape Tour. For the show's rendition, the singer walked upon a moving walkway alongside two keyboard players Fuoco Karasinski compared the introduction to that of Jamiroquai. The recording was also played during Stefani's fashion shows. At the promotional concert series MasterCard Priceless Surprises Presents Gwen Stefani, the song was performed as a part of a Harajuku Medley , consisting of the songs Harajuku Girls , Don't Get It Twisted , Now That You Got It , and Bubble Pop Electric , and the aforementioned song. The medley contained J pop and disco elements, and served as a virtual sonic tour of Stefani's many stylistic identities .

"Yuna , Yuna is a fictional character from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. She was first introduced as the female protagonist and one of the main playable characters of the 2001 role playing video game Final Fantasy X, appearing as a summoner embarking on a journey to defeat the world threatening monster Sin alongside her companions, including the male protagonist Tidus. Yuna reappears in Final Fantasy X 2, where she becomes the protagonist, searching for a way to find Tidus two years following his disappearance. Yuna has also been featured in other Square Enix games, notably Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. Tetsuya Nomura based Yuna's overall design on hakama, but also wanted to give her outfit something that would flow and so gave her a furisode. Nomura said that her name means night in the Okinawan language, which contrasts with Tidus' name, which is Okinawan for sun . For Final Fantasy X 2, the game's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game's atmosphere. Yuna's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus, as well as her characterization and sex appeal. Despite this positive reception, there was a mixed reception for her role in Final Fantasy X 2 due to her redesign. In Final Fantasy X, Yuna is introduced as a summoner who can use healing magic and is able to summon powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as Fayths. Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner Braska, who previously brought a brief respite from Sin's destruction ten years earlier, Yuna decides to embark on the summoner's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself. Yuna must journey to temples across the world, acquire the aeon from each and summon the Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both. She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus. Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can summon the final aeon, Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices. After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon, who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira. However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat. In Final Fantasy X 2, set two years after Final Fantasy X, Yuna is a member of the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's international version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In X 2, Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again. She also appears in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, an action game that features several Final Fantasy characters, as one of the characters to be summoned by the goddess Cosmos to participate in a war against her rival Chaos. For this game, Yuna appears in her Final Fantasy X form but sightly arranged to fit with the game's cast. Additionally, she has an alternative design based on Yoshitaka Amano's illustration, and a wedding dress from Final Fantasy X. Her Final Fantasy X 2 regular form was made available as downloadable content. Outside the Final Fantasy series, Yuna appears in Kingdom Hearts II as a pixie along with Paine and Rikku. Bribed by Maleficent into spying on Leon's group, the pixies eventually switch sides after being abandoned by the witch and told of Sora's cause. Yuna is also featured in the board game style video game Itadaki Street Special, appearing alongside Auron and Tidus, and represents Final Fantasy X in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Multiple figures and figurines of Yuna were produced by various manufacturers, including a 2001 figure by Square. A 2003 audio CD Final Fantasy X 2 Vocal Collections features performances by Mayuko Aoki, Marika Matsumoto and Megumi Toyoguchi, the voice actresses for Yuna, Rikku and Paine, respectively. According to Tetsuya Nomura, he based Yuna's overall design on hakama, a type of traditional Japanese clothing. Nomura said that when he learned the character was to perform a dance called the sending, he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of kimono he chose for her was a furisode, a long sleeved kimono. Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called yuna, and that her name carries the meaning of night in Okinawan, establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of Final Fantasy X, Tidus, whose Japanese name translates to sun in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them. The positive fan reaction to Final Fantasy X convinced the developers to continue the story of Yuna and other characters with Final Fantasy X 2. Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change. Producer Yoshinori Kitase added that they did not want to make Final Fantasy X 2 feel like an extension of its predecessor, so they changed the clothing of Yuna, Rikku and others' to make them seem more active. This was accomplished before the story and setting were created. Because Yuna, Rikku and Paine live in a more care free world, the designers wanted them to be able to dress up, a feature which became key to the gameplay. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima described her new outfit as a natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in FFX. Yuna's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates. Final Fantasy X director Motomu Toriyama said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore. He added that while she could be seen as a completely different person, ... deep in her heart, she is the same old Yuna. In the Japanese versions of the games Yuna has been voiced by Mayuko Aoki. Hedy Burress provides the character's voice in the English adaptations of the game. In voicing Yuna, Burress remembers trying to translate Yuna's duty, respect and honor, but also wanting to retain the gentleness and femininity of her character. When commenting on how the audiences would react to Final Fantasy X, Burress said that she wanted them to participate in the game itself and to transport them into a completely different world through the voices. Yuna received positive critical reception for her appearance in Final Fantasy X. Chris Reiter of Gaming Target ranked her as the third best PlayStation 2 babe , describing her as the star heroine whose soft features, kindness, and her unique story makes her one of the better beauties to love.

In 2013, Complex editors Michael Rougeau and Gus Turner listed Yuna at number 21 on the list of the greatest heroines in video game history. ranked Yuna as the sixth greatest Final Fantasy character of all time. However, PSU.com retrospectively called Yuna an underrated character and stated that she was overlooked due to Auron and Rikku. GamesRadar listed Yuna as one of the 25 best new characters of the 2000s, describing the romance between her and Tidus as legendary and Yuna herself as compassionate, generous and dutiful. Yuna and Tidus were included on the list of great loves by Matthew Rorie of GameSpot in 2006, while AJ Glasser of GamesRadar in 2008 listed them as the second best Square Enix couple. Their kiss scene was declared as number two best in video games by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist, and Yuna's abortive wedding with Seymour was also ranked as the third memorable matrimony in the history of PlayStation by Official PlayStation Magazine in 2014. Yuna's design change in Final Fantasy X 2 received a mixed reception. Rob Wright of Tom's Hardware included her among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history. Jeremy Dunham of IGN praised the clothing designs, combining proven and recognizable Final Fantasy styles with a revealing neo modern fashion sense , referencing her warrior costume as a stand out, and also said that English voice actress Hedy Burress' portrayal seemed more comfortable as opposed to the previous game. Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot praised Burress' voice acting, saying that it brought her fully to life in accordance with the other changes in the character. The book Packaging Girlhood Rescuing Our Daughters from Marketers' Schemes described Yuna's appearance as being a sexy MTV video star , adding that it is a lesson to girls that being brave, strong, and ready to fight can only last so long the next adventure is fashion, boyfriends, and sex. GameSpy's Raymond Psylancer Padilla called her the video game vixen of my dreams. Christian Nutt, also of GameSpy, described Burress' portrayal of Yuna in X 2 as superb. Various publications compared Yuna to other fictional characters, including the Charlie's Angels's Natalie Cook as portrayed by Cameron Diaz and Tomb Raider star Lara Croft, due to her attire and gun wielding skills. In 2008, GameDaily listed the Final Fantasy X 2 incarnation of Yuna as one of the top 50 hottest video game women, praising her revealing outfit as well as her alternate costumes. That same year, she was ranked as the tenth on top Final Fantasy character by IGN, commenting that while her original appearance made her fine eye candy and her sending scene was one of the best works by the CG studio Square Visual Works, it was the sequel that gave her more confidence and attitude, as well as a gratuitously exploitative costume that ranks among the series' finest bits of fanboy baiting. The character also gained a significant and enduring popularity among the gamer public, especially in Japan. Readers of Game Informer voted Yuna's relationship with Tidus as the best of 2001. Yuna was voted the 10th most popular video game character in Japan in a 2008 Oricon poll, as well as 16th in a similar poll by Famitsu 2010. In a 2010 ASCII Media Works poll in which Japanese fans would vote whose video game or manga character would like to name their children after, Yuna came second in the female category. In official Square Enix polls, Yuna was voted the third most commonly favorite female Final Fantasy character in 2013 and the most popular Final Fantasy heroine in 2014.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuna%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29
"The Yunnan hare Lepus comus is a medium sized species of mammal in the family Leporidae. It has soft, flat, and long dorsal pelage which is grayish brown or dark gray in color, and whitish ventral pelage. It was considered endemic to China mainly in Yunnan , but its presence was recorded in northern Myanmar in 2000. It is a herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. It is rated as a species of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Endangered Species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, almost meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. The Yunnan hare was first described by the American zoologist Glover Morrill Allen in 1927. According to Hoffmann and Smith, there are no recognized subspecies, but according to Mammals of China, there are three recognized subspecies It was formerly considered a subspecies of the woolly hare Lepus oiostolus , but is now treated as a separate species. Cai and Feng 1982 and Wang 1985 elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare. In 2005, it was found that molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare Lepus nigricollis and probably be its northern form. The Yunnan hare is a medium sized hare, measuring 32.2 to 48 cm 12.7 to 18.9 in in length, and weighing 1.8 to 2.5 kg 4.0 to 5.5 lb . It has a 9.5 to 11 cm 3.7 to 4.3 in long light gray tail, tinged yellow below, which is brownish on the upper surface. The skull is thin, measuring 8.4 to 9.5 cm 3.3 to 3.7 in in length. It has soft, flat, and long dorsal pelage which is grayish brown or dark gray in color, and whitish ventral pelageits back of the hip and rump are grayish, and ochraceous buff extending up to the forelegs, latus, and outer side of hindlegs. The short ears measure 9.7 to 13.5 cm 3.8 to 5.3 in in length, are pale gray at the inner surface, and black at the top. A whitish band runs from the base of the ear to the snout, including an arch over the eye. It has short nasal cavities, broad at the back side.

The Yunnan hare is smaller than the woolly hare the supraorbitals are flat and small, and the toothrow and diastema space between two teeth are of different proportions. It also has a characteristic brighter pelage than the woolly hare, although, according to Gao Yaoting, the Yunnan hare's gray rump is also a characteristic of the woolly hare. The species is found across the western Yungui Plateau and southern Hengduan Mountains in the provinces of Yunnan except southwest of Mekong River , southern Sichuan, and western Guizhou, in Southwest China, and has also been recorded to occur in northern Myanmar. The subspecies L. c. comus occurs in western Yunnan. L. c. peni occurs from central Yunnan, to western Guizhou Guiyang City, Bijie, Loudian in the east, to Muli in the north, and to southwestern Sichuan Huidong in the south. L. c. pygmaeus occurs from near the Yangtse River in the north, to central Yunnan. It is a mountainous species, and prefers warm, wet habitat. Although not much is known about its habitat, it is thought to occur in high montane shrubs and meadows throughout its distribution, similar to the Tibetan habitat of the woolly hare Lepus oiostolus . It may also occur in open forests or forest edges. It is found at medium elevations of 1,300 to 3,200 m 4,300 to 10,500 ft above sea level. The Yunnan hare is a diurnal species, but is also active during the night to forage. It is an herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. According to reports by hunters, the adult Yunnan hare has three burrows those of the male are shallower, smaller, and straighter than those of the female that are oval and larger in shape. Breeding usually commences in April. There are one to four, usually two, young in a litter, and in May, the female gives two or three litters. Since 1996, the Yunnan hare is rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is a widespread species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may pose a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan%20hare
"Yuri on Ice Japanese on ICE is a Japanese sports anime television series about figure skating. The series was produced by MAPPA, directed and written by Sayo Yamamoto with original scripts by Mitsuro Kubo under the chief direction of Jun Shishido. Character designs were handled by Tadashi Hiramatsu, and its music was composed by Taro Umebayashi and Taku Matsushiba. The figure skating was choreographed by Kenji Miyamoto, who also performed routines himself which were recorded and used as skating sound effects. The series premiered on October 6, 2016 and ended on December 22, with a total of 12 episodes. A Yuri on Ice feature film, Ice Adolescence, was originally planned for release in 2019, but has been delayed to a later date. The series revolves around the relationships between Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki his idol, Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov, and up and coming Russian skater Yuri Plisetsky as Yuri K. and Yuri P. take part in the Figure Skating Grand Prix, with Victor acting as coach to Yuri K. Yuri on Ice has been well received in Japan. It won three awards at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival, a Japan Character Award and seven awards in Crunchyroll's inaugural Anime Awards. In Japan, the series was released in six parts on Blu Ray and DVD, with all the releases coming No. 1 on the Oricon Animation Blu Ray disc and Animation DVD disc rankings respectively. It was the eighth most successful media franchise in Japan for 2017, had the second highest combined Blu Ray and DVD sales of any anime in Japan for 2017, and had the highest combined sales for a TV anime that year. It was popular on social media outlets such as Tumblr, Sina Weibo and Twitter, where it received over a million more tweets than the next most talked about anime series in the season it was broadcast. It also attracted praise from professional figure skaters, with some skaters in the 2018 Winter Olympics performing to music from the show. Yuri on Ice has raised discussion concerning its depiction of a same sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality in a way that differs from most anime and manga such as the yaoi genre, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present day issues with homophobia. Others criticized its depiction for being unrealistic, and of visual censorship that arguably makes it ambiguous to some viewers. The series has also been praised for its depiction of anxiety, and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating based title to be released in the United States in 2017. After a crushing defeat in the Grand Prix Final and other competition losses, 23 year old Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki develops mixed feelings about skating and puts his career on hold returning to his hometown of Hasetsu in Kyushu. Yuri visits his childhood friend, Yuko, at an ice rink Ice Castle Hasetsu and perfectly mimics an advanced skating routine performed by his idol Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov. When secretly recorded footage of Yuri's performance is uploaded to the internet, it catches Victor's attention, and he travels to Kyushu with an offer to coach Yuri and revive his figure skating career. Later, it is revealed that Victor was already familiar with Yuri, having met him before at a banquet where Yuri got drunk and asked Victor to be his coach. After learning about Victor's career decision, Yuri Plisetsky, a rising 15 year old Russian prodigy skater, travels to Hasetsu to make Victor keep a promise made prior to the beginning of the series. Victor had promised he would choreograph a routine specifically for Yuri P. if he won the Junior World Championships, which Yuri P. presumably did. Victor, having forgotten about his promise to Yuri P., makes the two Yuris compete against each other to decide who he will coach. He chooses two songs for the skaters, both with the same melody but with a different meaning. The first song, Agape , was about unconditional love, and is given to Yuri P. The second song, Eros, is about sexual love, and is given to Yuri K. Yuri K.'s performance wins, and Victor becomes Yuri K.'s coach. Yuri P. returns to Russia, and both Yuris vow to win the Grand Prix championship. Both Yuri K. and Yuri P. qualify to represent their countries in the Grand Prix series, and then later qualify for the Grand Prix Final in Barcelona. Over the course of the Grand Prix, Yuri K. and Victor become increasingly close, with the two of them seemingly kissing in public although all on screen footage of them kissing is obscured and thus ambiguous , and with Yuri K. buying them both gold rings in Barcelona, which leads to remarks by Victor about them being engaged. On the eve of the final, Yuri K. plans to quit skating so that Victor can return to the sport and tells Victor of his decision, but Victor tearfully rejects the idea, and they agree to choose their paths after the tournament has finished. The tournament ends with Yuri P. winning the gold medal and Yuri K. winning silver. As a result, Yuri K. decides to continue skating and moves to St. Petersburg so that he can continue to stay together with Victor, and train alongside Yuri P. and Victor. The original TV series of Yuri on Ice aired on TV Asahi from October 6 to December 22, 2016. The anime was produced by MAPPA, directed and written by Sayo Yamamoto using original scripts by Mitsuro Kubo under the supervision of Jun Shishido, with character design by Tadashi Hiramatsu, music by Taro Umebayashi and Taku Matsushiba and figure skating choreography by Kenji Miyamoto. The episodes were made available for streaming by Crunchyroll, and Funimation began streaming an English dub on October 24, 2016, at 10 00 p.m. ET. Yuri on Ice will have six Blu ray and DVD sets released in Japan. The first set, containing the first two episodes, was released on December 30, 2016. Each set includes bonus content such as booklets, production audio commentary and costume design and choreography videos. Yuri Katsuki's hometown of Hasetsu, Kyushu is based on Karatsu, Saga. In December 2016, Saga Prefecture's Sagaprise project announced plans to use Yuri on Ice to promote tourism in the area. According to Akinori Kawakami, president of the Association to Connect Hasetsu and Karatsu, 20 to 30 people visit Karatsu every day on anime pilgrimages. By May 2017, Yuri on Ice helped to attract 20,000 tourists from 27 countries to Karatsu. On February 22, 2017, the Nikkan Sports newspaper featured a collaborative illustration depicting Yuri K., Yuri P. and Victor supporting Sagan Tosu football club, which is based in Saga Prefecture. According to a Sakuga Blog study, Yuri on Ice used more key animators than any other anime series during the fall 2016 season an average of 48.5 key animators per episode, five more than Flip Flappers which had the second highest number of key animators . In the early episodes of the series, each character was handled by a different key animator, meaning that skating style of the characters differed from each other. In the skating scenes, the sound effects were changed to match each venue, according to the building's capacity and crowd size. The skating sounds for each sequence were recorded separately. No stock sounds were used for the sequences because each part sounds different, and no footage of professional skaters was used because the music in the programmes normally muffles the sounds. Thus the sounds used were recorded and performed by series choreographer Miyamoto, and each skating sequence is unique to the program. The opening theme, History Maker by Dean Fujioka, and ending theme, You Only Live Once by Wataru Hatano, were both released as singles. A compilation CD entitled Oh SkaTra Yuri on ICE Oh on ICE , with the anime's 24 original songs, was released on December 21, 2016. The insert song Yuri On Ice was included in Piano Solo Chu Jokyu Figure Skate Meikyoku shu Hyoyo ni Hibiku Melody 2016 2017, a piano book released on January 21, 2017 with music used by figure skaters including Mao Asada and Yuzuru Hanyu . It was the only anime song in the music book release. An album of the TV soundtrack, the Yutora Yuri on Ice Original Soundtrack Collection, was released on June 28, 2017. A side story manga, Yuri On Ice Side Story Welcome to The Madness, was published on May 26, 2017 as a bonus item included with the final Blu Ray volume of the anime series. Written and illustrated by series co creator Mitsurou Kubo, the manga follows Yuri P. and Otabek the night after the Grand Prix Final. An original video animation also included with the Blu Ray, Welcome to The Madness, depicts Yuri P.'s skate at the Grand Prix Final exhibition event. A Yuri on Ice original film was announced on April 29, 2017 at the Yuri on Stage exhibition event. The film's title, Yuri on Ice the Movie Ice Adolescence Yuri on Ice Gekijo ban Ice Adolescence was announced on July 1, 2018 at the Yuri on Concert event. The film was originally scheduled to be released in 2019, but it has been delayed to another, currently unknown release date. A teaser trailer depicting a young Viktor Nikiforov performing at the Winter Olympic Games was released in Japan on January 17, 2019 as a part of a Yuri on Ice marathon event. The primary production staff from the Yuri on Ice anime series will return to produce Ice Adolescence, including series creators Sayo Yamamoto and Mitsuro Kubo as the film's director and screenwriter, respectively. The series received positive reviews from critics and professional figure skaters. Among critics, in Anime News Network's Best and Worst Anime of Fall 2016 , five out of nine reviewers called Yuri on Ice the season's best show. In July 2017, the series was named by Eleanor Bley Griffiths of the Radio Times as one of the best anime TV series available to watch in the UK. From professionals, Yuri on Ice was well received by figure skaters, including Johnny Weir, Evgenia Medvedeva, Denis Ten, Evgeni Plushenko, Masato Kimura, Ryuichi Kihara, Miu Suzaki, and Adam Rippon and included cameo appearances by skaters Nobunari Oda and Stephane Lambiel. Weir said in an interview that I broke my rule about one episode per day because I physically couldn't stop watching. The closing scene of the tenth episode, when Yuri K. drunkenly pole dances, was also commended by professional pole dancers for its accuracy. Yuri on Ice has also been praised for its direction. Critics have commented on Sayo Yamamoto's diverse range of characters. Brandon Teteruck of Crunchyroll commented Yamamoto is subtly crafting a work that embraces diversity and cultural acceptance. Yamamoto does not characterize the foreign skaters as ethnic stereotypes, but rather allows them to act and behave as their own people. Teteruck also claims that Yamamoto subverts traditional representations of gender, sexuality, and nationality. He highlights a scene in the sixth episode in which the Thai skater Phichit Chulanont skates to a piece of music referencing The King and I, of which the 1956 and 1999 film version are both banned in Thailand. However, the plot was criticised for being repetitive. The characters have received positive comment, primarily over the same sex relationship between Yuri K. and Victor. Critics have praised the character of Yuri K. for being a realistic depiction of someone suffering from anxiety and as, a textbook example of an unreliable narrator . Other characters were also praised, with James Beckett of Anime News Network calling Yuri P. one of 2016's best anime characters. The quality of the animation received a mixed reception. The quality of the animation in early episodes was lauded by Clover Harker of the UK Anime Network, who said it was, impressive . Kevin Cirugeda of Anime News Network commented that character designer Tadashi Hiramatsu was able to, make it feel fresh, but also weirdly reminiscent of the past , comparing the series to FLCL. In later episodes however, there was criticism of the animation skating routines, with one describing it as, at times painful, or perhaps embarrassing to watch , while another said that the poor animation was the fault of Yamamoto's over ambition. The music gained positive comment, especially the opening theme tune to the series, History Maker . Ian Wolf of Anime UK News commented on its rousing theme the use of English connecting to the show's international feel and the use of both unusual musical instruments such a xylophone in the introduction and of a 68 time signature, arguably make the song a fast waltz and thus a dance akin to ballet. History Maker was played in the opening ceremony of the 201718 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in Nagoya. In the 2018 Winter Olympics, Kihara and Suzaki performed to the piano version of Yuri on Ice , from the Oh SkaTra Yuri on ICE soundtrack, in the figure skating team event pairs competition. In Crunchyroll's inaugural The Anime Awards, Yuri on Ice received awards in all of its seven nomination categories Best Boy Yuri K. , Best Animation, Most Heartwarming Scene The Kiss , episode seven , Best Couple Yuri K. and Victor , Best Opening, Best Closing, and Anime of the Year. Although some Crunchyroll users complained that the show won awards it did not deserve, notably the award for Best Animation, and accused fans of Yuri on Ice of rigging the vote, others defended the awards, writing that there was no conclusive evidence to prove this, while Crunchyroll stated on Twitter that they had used strong anti cheating methods. Kun Gao, the general manager and founder of Crunchyroll, wrote We are thrilled that Yuri on Ice has both captivated passionate anime fans and introduced new viewers to anime, and we are privileged to have had the opportunity to distribute this amazing property to its many viewers outside Japan . When reviewing the US Blu Ray release of the series for Anime News Network, Jacob Chapman commented on the criticism Yuri on Ice received when it won the Anime Awards. He wrote that some people argued the fans were drawn to the anime as a form of escapism following the political events of 2016 among other factors, but he responded to this saying that The problem with this reductive view is that it assumes Yuri on Ice is anywhere near as lightweight and fluffy as its sparkly cover art might suggest. It's also just a gilded version of the more common only horny fangirls care about this argument, meant to delegitimize the show's audience and therefore its merits as a work of art. At the Tokyo Anime Award Festival in 2017, Yuri on Ice won Animation of the Year Television Category and the fan polled Anime Fan Award. Character designer Tadashi Hiramatsu won the award for Best Animator. In the 2017 Japan Character Awards presented by the Character Brand Licensing Association CBLA , Yuri on Ice won the Japan Character Grand Prize New Face Award.

The kiss won the 2016 The Anime Awards for Most Heartwarming Scene. The exchange of rings between Yuri K. and Victor in the tenth episode is considered the first time such a relationship has been depicted in anime. Gabriella Ekens wrote for Anime News Network, Yuri on Ice, in depicting a sincere and uncomplicated engagement between two dudes, is unprecedented in anime. There hasn't even been a for real gay marriage in Japan, so this show is depicting something that isn't legally possible in its country of origin . For Anime UK News, Ian Wolf called the exchange of rings the best scene in the series . According to Wolf, the anime is an example of the Odagiri effect. Yuri on Ice has highlighted homophobia in figure skating and other areas the seventh episode features a flashback in which a younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir said in an interview with The Geekiary, I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps. The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights. Yuri on Ice differs from other anime covering same sex relationships, such as yaoi and yuri. Carli Velocci of Geek.com wrote, Their relationship exists somewhere beyond any sexuality, meaning it doesn't fall into the same traps that a lot of yuri and yaoi relationships do ... While this isn't the first anime with a same sex couple at the forefront, it's one of the first to present a story that isn't strictly sexual and is mutual. Yuri and Victor complement each other, but both also admit that they've grown as people because of the presence of the other. The equality in their relationship is revolutionary, even if it wasn't the first to depict one. You can assign the seme or uke label to Victor and Yuri, but when it comes to their psychological bond, it's more equal ... Yuri and Victor aren't just another gay anime couple. They're almost real. A review in Otaku USA has argued that the skaters take on an androgynous appearance when they are performing, saying While on ice in the series proper, the main performers often take on an androgynous appearance to feed the show's substance. Yuri's evolution in terms of confidence and capabilities is at the core of the plot, but the heart lies in Yuri's exploration of his feminine side via emotional expression. ... Gender roles are further addressed via Viktor's lines of encouragement to Yuri that, at least as translated, imply both skating direction and romantic suggestion. The relationship has also been criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life. Others have remarked that some viewers might refuse to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the kiss is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit. Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku wondered why the kiss was blocked when other anime, such as From the New World, had depicted gay kisses. Wolf of Anime UK News originally said of the scene that I'm 99.999 sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001 is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees I want to see what is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters at the same time as them . However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off. In January 2017 the Hallmark Channel announced the release of a TV movie, Love on Ice, about the relationship between a female figure skater in a career slump and her new male coach. It was seen by some fans of Yuri on Ice as plagiarism due to plot similarities, and Hallmark was accused of trying to straightwash the relationship between Yuri Katsuki and Victor Nikiforov. Fans of Yuri on Ice responded to Love on Ice by posting a Change.org petition demanding an explanation of the similarities between the two stories and hijacking Love on Ice's IMDb page to contain the plot summary of Yuri on Ice. The similarity between the stories is apparently coincidental, since Love on Ice began filming in early November 2016 about a month after Yuri on Ice began broadcasting . According to Hallmark, no one involved in the making of Love on Ice had heard of Yuri on Ice. Mitsuro Kubo posted on Twitter that she believed the similarities to be a coincidence, and the creator of the Change.org petition acknowledged that Love on Ice was not plagiarism.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri%20on%20Ice
"Yuuyami Doori Tankentai Japanese is a horror themed adventure game developed and published by Spike for the PlayStation. It plays similarly to the Twilight Syndrome series by Human Entertainment, and follows a story of Japanese youth exploring paranormal urban legends in their neighborhood. The player can choose to play as one of three junior high students, first eavesdropping on rumors being discussed at their school, then investigating these rumors in the freely explorable city. The game was developed over two years by former Human staff that had worked on Twilight Syndrome. It was released on 7 October 1999 following a popular trend of horror in Japanese media. It received a limited release and remained mostly unknown for years, but has grown a following over time. In retrospect, Japanese critics have dubbed the game a masterpiece for its captivating sense of realism. A western journalist discussed it as a reflection of the uneasiness felt in Japanese society during the country's recession in the 1990s. Yuuyami Doori Tankentai is an adventure game that plays similarly to the Twilight Syndrome series. The game is set in the late 1990s in the fictional Hirumi City, a stereotypical Japanese neighborhood with shopping districts, hospitals, construction sites, and parks. Although never stated, it is implied the city was born out of Japan's economic boom during the 1980s and has since fallen into disrepair. The story follows three junior high school students exploring urban legends in their city, typically with a paranormal theme. The students are a boy named Nao and his dog Meros, as well as two girls, Kurumi and Sango. Each chapter consists of two phases, first collecting rumors at the school and then later investigating them in the city. The player can choose one of the three characters to play as when starting each chapter, a choice which will affect how the story proceeds. The player is allotted five minutes to listen in on rumors at school. Each character has different friends, so may hear different rumors. There are 44 total rumors in the game. After this, the player has ten minutes to investigate any rumors by exploring the city, searching suspicious places, objects, and people. The player can consult the other characters at any time, and view information on rumors they have collected in their journal. They can also browse an in game map of the city to aid in exploring, or use a physical map that came packaged with the game. The dog, Meros, will typically explore the city with the characters and will stop in his tracks if he senses anything strange. In some situations, the game switches to a 360 degree panorama mode, where the player can look around freely. Horror was a popular trend in Japanese media during the late 1990s, with movies such as Ring 1998 being successful. In the video game industry, the PlayStation and other hardware were pushing the limits of graphical expression, so naturally horror video games became popular. In March 1996, Human Entertainment launched the Twilight Syndrome series, 2D side scrolling adventure games that followed three high school girls exploring strange occult phenomena in their neighborhood. After Human Entertainment folded, some of the staff went on to form Spike, including some involved with Twilight Syndrome, and decided to develop another horror game borrowing the series' gameplay system. The lead designer previously worked on the first Twilight Syndrome game, and the producer in this game later reprised his role for the third game in the Twilight Syndrome series, which was developed by Spike. The team aimed to create a sense of realism with their new game. It was released on 7 October 1999, after two and a half years of development. Yuuyami Doori Tankentai was released in limited quantities, and it remained relatively unknown for years. The game garnered more interest over time and now commands high prices of 15,000 to 20,000 yen on secondary markets due to increased demand. Upon release, Famitsu scored it at 26 out of 40, feeling the gameplay was old fashioned and its horror elements came late after the Japanese horror boom. Japanese critics have dubbed the game a masterpiece in retrospect. Dengeki Online was disappointed the game was not more well known, feeling it is one of the best takes on urban legend storytelling and a better style of horror than the shock and jump scares popular in the 2010s. They praised the originality of the rumors, and enjoyed the process of unraveling the stories. Game Spark called it one of the best horror games on the PlayStation, praising its graphics, writing, and freedom of exploration. Dengeki Online wrote that the graphical style added a sense of realism, giving it a casual everyday feel. Den Faminico Gamer agreed, saying the game's realistic graphics and ambience, such as construction and traffic noises, helped establish fear. Dengeki Online also complimented the map packaged with the game, giving a sense that the city was real. In 2017, Brian Crimmins writing for Heterotopias discussed Yuuyami Doori Tankentai as a reflection of the uncertainty felt in Japanese society during the 1990s recession. He felt the game was particularly notable for how it realistically portrayed the lives of Japanese youth, and felt the game's horror lied not in the rumor storylines, but in the daily reality experienced by the characters in a city defined by urban decay and lost innocence . He writes Nao and companys emotional outlooks coincide well with what the space around them has fallen into. Very generally Hirumis environments connote alienation, lost futures, and a lack of control over ones life. He cited examples such as the tangled web of streets that make up the city, the complications of school socialization, and the varied environments which ranged from empty to claustrophobic.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuuyami%20Doori%20Tankentai
"Yuyuen Chinese pinyin Yuyuan WadeGiles Yu yuen was a wooden steam powered frigate built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was one of two ships of the Haian class, which consisted of her and her sister Haian. They were the largest vessels built in China until the 1930s they each ran over budget and used sub standard building materials which limited their use. She was active in the defence of Nanking during the Sino French War, and formed part of a squadron which was sent to relieve the blockade of Formosa. Yuyuen was sunk in Shipu Bay during the Battle of Shipu on 15 February 1885. Yuyuen was a Haian class wooden steam powered frigate. She was constructed at the dockyard at the Kiangnan Arsenal for the Imperial Chinese Navy's Nanyang Fleet. Yuyuen and her sister ship Haian were the largest vessels built in China until the cruiser Ping Hai in 1931. Yuyuen displaced 2,630 long tons 2,672 t and measured 300 feet 91 m long overall, with a beam of 42 feet 13 m and an average draft of 21 feet 6.4 m . The propulsion system consisted of a 1,750 indicated horsepower 1,300 kilowatts reciprocating engine with a single shaft, enabling a cruising speed of 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph . She was also equipped with a sailing rig across her three masts. She had a crew complement of 372. Her armament initially consisted of two 9 inch 229 mm muzzle loading rifles MLRs mounted on the upper deck and 24 70 pounder Whitworth naval guns, the latter mounted in broadsides. During a later overhaul these were subsequently replaced with Krupp guns of varying sizes, with two 8.2 inch 208 mm guns placed on the upper deck, and the broadside replaced with four 5.9 inch 150 mm and 20 4.7 inch 119 mm guns. Yuyuen was built at a cost of 318,717 taels the cost of Haian and Yuyuen exceeded the budget and resulted in their limited use initially. Furthermore, due to the use of low quality pine from Oregon and Vancouver in the construction of the vessels meant that the timbers were showing obvious signs of rot after a few months of use. Yuyuen was launched on 23 December 1873 from the Kiagnan Arsenal, 19 months after her sister ship. Yuyuen was not initially manned after launch to recoup some of the overspend on construction costs. She was instead used as a storeship and guard ship in the Wusong District, Shanghai. Following the attack by the French Navy at the Battle of Foochow during the Sino French War in 1884, she formed part of a squadron whose objective was to hunt down French vessels following an anticipated attack on Nanking. Despite being out of date by that point, she was put into fighting trim . The other vessels in the squadron consisted of the cruisers Kai Che, Nan Shuin and Nan Thin. But instead of attacking Nanking, the French forces targeted Formosa instead. The Nanking squadron was sent to break a blockade of the island by the French Navy, being joined by the sloop of war Teng Ch'ing. The fleet was under the command of Admiral Wu Ang k'ang, while Yuyuen was commanded by Captain Chin Yung chai of the commanding officers, only the captain of Teng Ch'ing had experience with any sea training. The ships left Shanghai in December 1884, making slow progress south as the crew were trained en route. They reached Wenchow now Wenzhou in January 1885, and began to return north briefly. They made contact with the French navy as they left Shipu Bay on 14 February. The Chinese ships moved to attack in a V shaped formation, with the slower Yuyuen bringing up the rear. The French fleet saw the distance gathering between Yuyuen and the rest of the Chinese ships and sought to exploit this by moving in between. Yuyuen soon lost sight of the Chinese cruisers in the poor weather, and Admiral Wu on Teng Ch'ing realised that his vessel could not keep up either. The two ships moved back into Shipu Bay, the favourable currents allowing them to stay ahead of the French ships. The duo were blockaded in by the French ships, who could not enter the bay due to their deeper drafts. During the following night, two attempts were made to sink the ships using French steam powered cutters. An initial attack at around 10 00 pm on 14 February was repulsed by fire from the Chinese ships, but a second attempt at 4 00 am on 15 February by cutters from the battleship Bayard were successful after lying hidden among the various fishing vessels of various sizes within the bay. The cutters closed so near to Yuyuen that the chief engineer was able to reach over the side and hit a French sailor with his gun sponge. Small arms fire was exchanged between the crew. Of the three cutters, one successfully detonated a spar torpedo under Yuyuen, destroying the cutter in the process. Teng Ch'ing was also sunk, but the French forces claimed that it was not as a result of their attack. American adviser L. C. Arlington was stationed on Yuyuen at the time, and later reported the chaotic scene as the ship was attacked. Some of the crew jumped over the side, while others tried to lower boats. At no point had there been any attempt by the Chinese to fend off the French cutters, with the shore batteries only firing after the attack on Yuyuen. One of the shells fired by the batteries hit Teng Ch'ing, potentially causing her sinking. The two cutters retreated, relatively undamaged. This was the final time during the war that Chinese vessels were sunk, and Yuyuen was the largest vessel sunk during the conflict. Crew from the tugboat Fubleo arrived at Shipu on 18 February, and later gave a report to the China Daily. Yuyuen's hull had sunk below the water and was sitting upright with her sails still flying. Local villagers had already begun looting the vessel, having cut away topsail from the mizzen mast and were in the process of removing the spinnaker and retrieving one of the ship's hatches. When the Fubleo crew arrived in the village, they found the surviving crew of Yuyuen and Ten Ch'ing. They reported that the villages had attempted to prevent them from coming ashore, but they had been convinced through force of arms. The family of Captain Chin were subsequently arrested, with Chinese authorities demanding that the ships were not sunk under fire from the French, but instead by having holes drilled in the bottom of the hulls so that the crew could have an excuse for abandoning the ships. Unsuccessful attempts were later made to raise the Yuyuen.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%20frigate%20Yuyuen
"The Z 4 Plan was a proposed basis for negotiations to end the Croatian War of Independence with a political settlement. It was drafted by Peter W. Galbraith, Leonid Kerestedjiants and Geert Hinrich Ahrens on behalf of a mini Contact Group comprising United Nations envoys and diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union. The co chairs of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were closely involved in the political process surrounding the plan. The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuman and the leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina RSK on 30 January 1995. Although Tuman was displeased with the proposal, the RSK authoritiesinfluenced by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevicrefused to receive the document, let alone discuss it. Milosevic was concerned that the plan might be used to force the settlement of a crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province. Three more attempts to revive the plan were made after Operation Flash in early May, when Croatia captured a portion of western Slavonia previously controlled by the RSK. The first initiative, that began later that month, failed because the RSK demanded that the Croatian forces pull back from western Slavonia which Croatia declined to do . The second attempt failed simply because neither party wanted to negotiate. The final round of negotiations where the Z 4 Plan was proposed by international diplomats occurred in early August, when a major Croatian attack against the RSK seemed imminent. Despite last ditch efforts by Galbraith to persuade Milosevic and the RSK leadership to accept the plan, disagreement among the RSK leaders allowed Croatia to claim that the RSK had no intention of negotiating. The Croatian delegation, which had little interest in the negotiations and wanted to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the imminent military operation, presented its own demands to the RSK which were also rejected . On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm, defeated the RSK and effectively ended the political process which led to the creation of the Z 4 Plan. Elements of the plan made their way into two proposals on resolving the Kosovo crisis in 1999 during the Kosovo War and in 2005 as a part of the Kosovo status process. Neither was accepted by the parties to that conflict. In August 1990 an insurgency known as the Log Revolution took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina RSK and, after the RSK declared its intention to unite with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a breakaway state. By March 1991 the conflict escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three month moratorium on Croatia and the RSK's declarations followed, after which their decisions were implemented on 8 October. Since the Yugoslav People's Army JNA increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard ZNG was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army HV in November. The establishment of the Croatian military was hampered by a September UN arms embargo. The final months of 1991 saw JNA advances and the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Siege of Dubrovnik and the Battle of Vukovar. In November a ceasefire was negotiated pending a political settlement which became known as the Vance plan , and it was implemented in early January 1992. The ceasefire collapsed in January 1993 when the HV launched Operation Maslenica, and small scale clashes continued for more than a year. On 16 March 1994, Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin brokered negotiations between Croatia and the RSK which produced a new ceasefire on 30 March. Further negotiations produced agreements on reopening a section of the ZagrebBelgrade motorway crossing the RSK held part of western Slavonia, the Adria oil pipeline and several water supply lines by the end of 1994. The Z 4 Plan was drafted by United States ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith, Russian ambassador to Croatia Leonid Kerestedjiants and German diplomat Geert Hinrich Ahrens, representing the European Union EU in a mini Contact Group . The Z in the plan's name stood for Zagreb Croatia's capital , and 4 represented the involvement of the United States, Russia, the EU and the UN. The plan was the product of a process begun on 23 March 1994, with Galbraith considering himself its principal author. It was a well developed legal document intended as the basis for negotiations and, according to Ahrens, designed to commit Croatia to an internationally agreed settlement and prevent it from turning to a military resolution of the war while being generous to the Croatian Serbs . According to Ahrens, the plan was actually too generous to the Serbs in essence, it created the legal foundation for a permanent Serb state in Croatia. The heart of the plan was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina Part One . Part One defined Krajina as an autonomous region of Croatia, with borders based on the results of the 1991 Croatian census which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority . Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right to levy taxes and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two of the plan, the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 including eastern and western Slavonia and contained transitional provisions. Part Three of the plan spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia would be the first to be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover . The first draft of the Z 4 Plan was prepared in September 1994, and further developed and amended on several occasions during the following four months. Over this period, International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia ICFY co chairs David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg requested amendments to the plan and opposed its presentation to Croatian or RSK authorities. The first set of changes requested was to include a provision that Croatia cede territory around the city of Zupanja on the north bank of the Sava River to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, allowing better communication between Belgrade and the Bosnian Serb territory around Banja Luka. The request, submitted on 8 September, was turned down by the plan authors. That day, Owen requested that the plan allow Krajina to form a confederation with either Serbia or FR Yugoslavia. Owen and Stoltenberg sought to create a network of confederations between the former Yugoslav republics, but the authors of the Z 4 Plan deemed that impossible. German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, on behalf of the German EU presidency, cautioned Owen that Krajina Serbs formed only 5 percent of Croatia's population and a confederation between Kosovo and Albania would be more natural. On 6 October Russia declared its opposition to the confederation, but Owen regained the country's support for the idea four days later shortly before it was abandoned . The third group of requested amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status to be left unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control over a five year period and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in eletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co chairs. The co chairs began drafting their version of the plan Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat and ICFY ambassador Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith. On 1 October, Galbraith informed Croatian President Franjo Tuman of the plan without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martic. Although early Z 4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements of the plan were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and their opposition to the Z 4 Plan. Tuman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milosevic saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non Serb or ethnically mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandzak. Galbraith, Eide and Kerestedjiants agreed to deliver the plan to Croatia and the RSK on 21 October, opposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. Owen also asked Vitaly Churkin to instruct his envoy to oppose the delivery. As instructed by Moscow, Kerestedjiants pulled out of the move and Galbraith accused Owen of sabotaging the Z 4 Plan. The 53 page final version of the Z 4 Plan was prepared on 18 January 1995. Entitled Draft Agreement on the Krajina, Slavonia, Southern Baranja and Western Sirmium , it consisted of three documents and two provisional maps. The maps were considered provisional because of concerns that the inclusion of Benkovac in Krajina would be contested by Croatia a portion of the municipality had been predominantly inhabited by Croats, and it was on the Adriatic coast. Another territorial issue was the municipality of Slunj it was not included in Krajina, and the omission effectively cut Krajina in two. A possible solution to the problem was to split the municipality in two and award the areas east of Slunj to Krajina. In anticipation of this, planning began for a road bypassing Slunj. Despite the unresolved issues, delivery of the plan to Croatia and the RSK was scheduled for January. On 12 January, shortly before the plan's final version was drafted, Tuman announced in a letter to the UN that Croatia would not grant an extension of the UN peacekeeping mandate beyond 31 March and United Nations Protection Force UNPROFOR troops deployed to the RSK would have to leave. On 30 January the Z 4 Plan was presented to Tuman by the French ambassador to Croatia, accompanied by Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Ahrens and Italian ambassador Alfredo Matacotta replacing Eide . Tuman did not hide his displeasure with the plan, receiving the draft with the knowledge that Milosevic's opposition to the plan because of his concerns for Kosovo would not allow it to be implemented. Tuman accepted the plan which Croatia considered unacceptable as a base for negotiations with the RSK, hoping that they would dismiss it. The five diplomats then travelled to Knin to present the Z 4 Plan to the RSK leadership. There they met with Martic, RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelic and foreign minister Milan Babic. Martic refused to receive the draft before the UN Security Council issued a written statement extending the UNPROFOR mandate to protect the RSK. Kerestedjiants and Ahrens suggested that Martic should acknowledge receipt of the plan and then say that the RSK would not negotiate before the UNPROFOR issue was resolved, but he refused. The diplomats then attempted to meet Milosevic in Belgrade about the matter, but Milosevic refused to see them and the group returned to Zagreb the next day. Ahrens described the events of 30 January as a fiasco . Ahrens noted that Croatia and the RSK were satisfied with the outcome. Owen and Stoltenberg expressed their understanding of the RSK's and Milosevic's rejection of the plan, provoking a sharp reaction from Galbraith. The RSK parliament convened on 8 February with the Z 4 Plan as the sole item on the agenda. In their speeches there, Martic, Mikelic and Babic described the plan as provocative to the RSK and saw Milosevic's support in refusing the plan as greatly encouraging. A number of other influential Serbian politicians rejected the plan in addition to Milosevic, including Borisav Jovica close ally of Milosevic, who considered the RSK strong enough militarily to resist Croatiaand Vojislav Seselj, who considered the plan totally unacceptable. The opposition politicians in Serbia were split. Zoran inic said that since the RSK refused the plan Serbia should not accept it either, while Vuk Draskovic favoured the plan as an historic opportunity. Draskovic's views ultimately prevailed in the Serbian media, but not before late August. The only official reaction from Croatia was from its chief negotiator, Hrvoje Sarinic. Sarinic said that Croatia endorsed the restoration of Croatian rule, the return of refugees and local self government for Croatian Serbs, but dismissed plan solutions incompatible with the Constitution of Croatia. In Croatia, the plan and its authors especially Galbraith were strongly criticised in what Ahrens described as a vicious campaign . There were several more attempts to advocate the Z 4 Plan as the basis of a political settlement of the Croatian War of Independence. After Croatia captured western Slavonia from the RSK in Operation Flash in early May, Owen and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK officials to Geneva in an effort to revive the plan. The initiative was endorsed by the UN Security Council and the G7, which was preparing its summit in Halifax at the time. The meeting was attended by Owen, Stoltenberg, Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Eide and Ahrens as the international diplomats the RSK was represented by Martic, Mikelic and Babic, and the Croatian delegation was led by Sarinic. Sarinic accepted the invitation, claiming that the venue was a Croatian concession because Croatian authorities considered the issue an internal matter which should normally be dealt with in Croatia. On the other hand, the RSK delegation insisted on Croatian withdrawal from the territory captured earlier that month before negotiations could proceed. Since no such withdrawal was requested by the UN Security Council, Croatia rejected the demand and the initiative collapsed. A second attempt to revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign minister Herve de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees for the safety of Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate. Another effort involving the plan came about after Milosevic asked the United States to stop an imminent Croatian attack against the RSK on 30 July. Although in his request he indicated that negotiations should be held based on the Z 4 Plan, he refused to meet Galbraith who wanted Milosevic to pressure the RSK into accepting it on 2 August. Instead, Galbraith met Babic in Belgrade in an effort to persuade him to accept the plan. He told Babic that the RSK could not expect international sympathy because of its involvement in the Siege of Bihac, and they would have to accept Croatian terms to avoid war. As an alternative, Galbraith advised Babic to accept negotiations based on the Z 4 Plan. Babic complied, and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK delegations to talks on 3 August. Genthod, near Geneva, was selected as the location to avoid media attention. The RSK delegation was headed by Major General Mile Novakovic of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian delegation was headed by Tuman's advisor, Ivic Pasalic. At the meeting the RSK insisted on the withdrawal of the HV from western Slavonia and the gradual implementation of a ceasefire, followed by economic cooperation before a political settlement was discussed. The Croatian delegation did not intend to negotiate, but to prepare diplomatically for a military resolution of the war. Stoltenberg proposed a seven point compromise, including negotiations based on the Z 4 Plan, beginning on 10 August. The proposal was initially accepted by Babic, who then expressed reservations about the Z 4 Plan as a political settlement when he was asked to publicly declare support for the Stoltenberg proposal so the Novakovic delegation would follow his lead . Pasalic then asked Novakovic to accept Croatia's seven demands, including immediate replacement of the RSK with a Croatian civilian government. Novakovic refused Pasalic's proposal, indicating that he accepted the Stoltenberg proposal instead, and Pasalic declared that the RSK had declined a Croatian offer to negotiate. Croatia did not consider Babic powerful enough to secure support for an initiative from Martic, and thus unable to commit the RSK to an agreement. This view was supported by Babic himself, who told Galbraith during their 2 August meeting in Belgrade that Martic would only obey Milosevic. On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm against the RSK and, according to Galbraith, effectively terminated the Z 4 Plan and its associated political process. One final attempt, organised by Babic, was made to revive the Z 4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted Sarinic about the initiative, he dismissed any possibility of negotiation. Following Croatian military success against the RSK during Operation Storm in August, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Republika Srpska during Operation Mistral 2 in September, US President Bill Clinton announced a new peace initiative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. This initiative, which aimed to restore eastern Slavonia to Croatia, was based on Croatian sovereignty and the Z 4 Plan. Gailbraith sought to reconcile the plan with new circumstances in the field an example was limited self government for Croatian Serbs in eastern Slavonian municipalities where they comprised a majority of the 1991 population after Croatia objected, the proposal was replaced with provisions from the Constitution of Croatia. By early October the process led to the Erdut Agreement, establishing a framework for restoring eastern Slavonia to Croatian rule. When the agreement was first implemented in 1996, there were concerns in Croatia that the process might result in covert implementation of the Z 4 Plan in eastern Slavonia and political autonomy for the region. The Z 4 Plan was again resurrected in 1999 as a template for the Rambouillet Agreement, a proposed peace treaty negotiated between FR Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. In 2005, after the Kosovo War, Serbia and Montenegro attempted to resolve the Kosovo status process by tabling a peace plan offering broad autonomy for Kosovo. According to Draskovic, then foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, the plan was a mirror image of the Z 4 Plan . That year an RSK government in exile was set up in Belgrade, demanding the revival of the Z 4 Plan in Croatia a move condemned by Draskovic and Serbian President Boris Tadic . The same idea was put forward in 2010 by a Serb refugee organisation led by Savo Strbac.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-4%20Plan
"The German destroyer Z1 Leberecht Maass was the lead ship of her class of four destroyers built for the German Navy initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935 during the mid 1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship served as a flagship and spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. Several days after the start of the war in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maass and another destroyer unsuccessfully attacked Polish ships in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. She was lightly damaged during the action. In mid February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to attack British fishing trawlers Operation Wikinger , the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. A court of inquiry convened during the war determined that she and a sister ship were hit by bombs, but a post war investigation determined that she had drifted into a newly laid British minefield. Z1 Leberecht Maass broke in half with the loss of most of her crew. Design work on the Type 34 class destroyers began in 1932, despite the 800 long ton 810 t limit imposed by the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Reichsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high pressure boilers, were an over complicated system that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships. The class had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and were 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . They displaced 2,223 long tons 2,259 t at standard load and 3,156 long tons 3,207 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers. The ships had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but their maximum speed was 38.7 knots 71.7 km h 44.5 mph . The Type 34s carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but they proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew of the Type 34 class ships numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 34s carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from front to rear. Their anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ships carried eight 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. Leberecht Maass had four depth charge launchers mounted on the sides of her rear deckhouse, which was supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern, with either 32 or 64 charges carried. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. Z1 Leberecht Maass, named after Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Leberecht Maass, who was killed while commanding German forces in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, was the first destroyer to be built in Germany since World War I. She was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, on 10 October 1934 as yard number K232. The ship was launched on 18 August 1935 and completed on 14 January 1937, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Friedrich T. Schmidt. As the first ship of her class to be completed, Leberecht Maass became the flagship of the Leader of Torpedo boats Fuhrer der Torpedoboote FdT on 1 May and spent much of her first year training in the eastern Baltic Sea, before making a port visit in Gothenburg, Sweden, in early April 1938. Upon her return, the ship was turned over to her builders to have her bow rebuilt to fix the large amount of water that came over it in head seas. The ship then participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. Korvettenkapitan Gerhard Wagner relieved Schmidt in October. In December, Leberecht Maass, together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele, Z3 Max Schultz, and Z4 Richard Beitzen, sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate her seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with her new bow. On 2324 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the heavy cruiser Deutschland to occupy Memel. Korvettenkapitan Fritz Bassenge assumed command of Leberecht Maass the following month. Afterwards, she participated in the fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean, as the flagship of Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens, and visited Ceuta, Spain, and Ria de Arousa in Portugal in before departing for Germany on 13 May. The initial task of the Kriegsmarine when Hitler declared war on Poland on 1 September was to blockade the Polish coast and it deployed three light cruisers and ten destroyers to accomplish its mission. Leberecht Maass evaded an attack by the submarine ORP Wilk on the first day of the war and it quickly became apparent that the Kriegsmarine had deployed too many ships off the Polish coast and the cruisers were withdrawn. Two days later, the ship and Z9 Wolfgang Zenker were ordered to investigate the ships in the naval base at Hel. They spotted the Polish destroyer Wicher and the minelayer Gryf and engaged both ships at a range around 12,700 meters 13,900 yd . German fire was ineffective, but the Polish return fire was more accurate and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a smoke screen to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. Leberecht Maass was hit by a 152 millimeter 6.0 in shell from the coast defense battery defending the base at 06 57, which knocked out power to No. 2 gun, disabled its shell hoists, killed four crewmen and wounded another four. The ship fired 77 rounds of 12.7 cm ammunition during the battle. The following day, she sailed to Swinemunde to have her damage repaired, a process that took until 10 September as it included repairs to the ship's boiler tubes. After its completion, Leberecht Maass helped to lay defensive minefields in the North Sea and Lutjens transferred his flag to Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, the ship being assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla 2. Zerstorer Flotille . She began a previously scheduled refit in Swinemunde on 29 September and was again the flagship of the FdT by 30 November, but rejoined 2. Zerstorerflotille on 22 December. In retaliation for the Altmark Incident where the Royal Navy seized captured British sailors from the German tanker Altmark in neutral Norwegian waters on 16 February 1940, the Kriegsmarine organized Operation Nordmark to search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea as far north as the Shetland Islands. 2. Zerstorerflotille, including Leberecht Maass, escorted the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper during the initial stage of the sortie on 18 February, but Leberecht Maass and Z5 Paul Jacobi were detached the following day on an unsuccessful search for enemy shipping in the Skagerrak. A few days later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in cooperation with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. They believed that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support. Loaded with prize crews, Leberecht Maass and five other destroyers, Max Schultz, Richard Beitzen, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed on 22 February. En route, the flotilla was mistakenly attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Kampfgeschwader 26. Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost her steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew, including the ship's captain. Only 60 of her crew were saved. During the rescue effort, Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew. Hitler ordered a court of inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships had been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea. Postwar research revealed that one or both ships may have struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z1%20Leberecht%20Maass
"The German destroyer Z2 Georg Thiele was one of four Type 1934 class destroyers built for the German Navy Kriegsmarine during the mid 1930s. She was named after Georg Thiele, a Korvettenkapitan Corvette Captain who commanded the Seventh Half Flotilla of torpedo boats. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, in April 1940, Z2 Georg Thiele fought in both naval Battles of Narvik, on 10 and 13 April 1940, and had to be beached to allow her crew to abandon ship safely after she had been severely damaged by British fire. The ship, having broken up, is now a popular diving site. Design work on the Type 34 class destroyers began in 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the armament limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs for the new destroyers were for large ships more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew further as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only substantial innovative part of the design, the high pressure boilers, were an over complicated system that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships. The class had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and were 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . They displaced 2,223 long tons 2,259 t at standard load and 3,156 long tons 3,207 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers. The ships had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but attained an actual maximum speed of 38.7 knots 71.7 km h 44.5 mph . The Type 34s carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but they proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship the effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew of the Type 34 class ships numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 34s carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from front to rear. Their anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ships carried eight 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. Georg Thiele had four depth charge throwers mounted on the sides of her rear deckhouse, which were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern, with either 32 or 64 charges carried. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck, with a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. Z2 Georg Thiele was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, on 25 October 1934 as yard number K243. She was launched on 18 August 1935, and completed and commissioned on 27 February 1937. She was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Division on 1 December 1937 and made a port visit to Ulvik, Norway, in April 1938, together with her sisters Z3 Max Schultz and Z4 Richard Beitzen. She was then handed back to her builders, Deutsche Werke, to have her bow rebuilt to fix the damage caused by the large amount of water that came over it in head seas. This increased her length by .30 meters 1 ft 0 in . She then participated in the 22 August Fleet Review for Adolf Hitler and Miklos Horthy, Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, and the following fleet exercise. In December, Georg Thiele, together with her sisters Z1 Leberecht Maass, Max Schultz, and Richard Beitzen, sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate their seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with their new bows. On 2324 March 1939, she was one of the destroyers that escorted the heavily armed cruiser Deutschland, which was transporting Adolf Hitler to announce the occupation of Memel. She participated in the spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. When World War II began, Georg Thiele was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. The ship began a refit in late 1939 that was completed in early April 1940. Georg Thiele was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. The German destroyers reached the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April and Commodore Friedrich Bonte took his flagship Wilhelm Heidkamp, Georg Thiele and Z11 Bernd von Arnim down the fjord to Narvik. A heavy snowstorm allowed Thiele and von Arnim to enter the harbor without challenge and tie up at a pier. The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but the ships were spotted by the coast defense ship Norge a few minutes later. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire approximately thirteen 21 cm 8.3 in shells at a range of 600800 meters 660870 yd before von Arnim sank the Norwegian ship with torpedoes. In the darkness and falling snow, none of the Norwegian shells hit either of the two destroyers, despite the short range. Thiele and von Arnim were the first ships to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a southern arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, HMS Hardy, HMS Havock, HMS Hunter, HMS Hotspur, and HMS Hero, surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but Thiele and von Arnim had also been alerted and were coming up to engage the British. The two German destroyers crossed the T of the British flotilla and were able to fire full broadsides at a range of only 4,000 meters 13,000 ft . They first engaged the British flagship, HMS Hardy, and badly damaged her. Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. Hardy was forced to beach herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to HMS Havock, the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective, and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. Havock pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed HMS Hunter in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. Thiele is believed to have hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by HMS Hotspur when the latter ship lost steering control. Hotspur was able to disengage, but Hunter capsized shortly afterwards. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen. Georg Thiele was hit seven times and badly damaged. The British shells knocked out her forward gun and her fire control equipment, flooded one magazine, started fires, and killed thirteen crewmen. On the night of 12 13 April, Commander Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. Thiele, still under repair, had only four usable guns by this time and six remaining torpedoes. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers appeared on 13 April, earlier than Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including Thiele, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships without much success. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord , east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. Thiele still had some ammunition and torpedoes left, and took up position at the Straumen narrows with Z18 Hans Ludemann to give the remaining two destroyers time to scuttle themselves at the head of the fjord. The pursuing British destroyers initially engaged Ludemann, until the ship retreated to the head of the fjord after exhausting all of its ammunition. The British destroyers then switched their attentions to Thiele. The German ship struck the first blow when one of her torpedoes blew the bow off Eskimo, but the return fire from the British ships started several fires and damaged her so heavily that Korvettenkapitan Max Eckart Wolff, the ship's captain, ordered her run aground to allow her crew to abandon ship safely. Fourteen men were killed during the battle and another 28 wounded. The surviving crew of the ship took part in the land fighting at Narvik in the following weeks. Wolff served as a battalion commander in the Marine Regiment Berger during the land battle. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class on 12 May 1940 and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross the following August for his command of Thiele at Narvik. The ship later broke in two and capsized. Today, the wreck is one of the most popular diving sites in Narvik.

"Z3 Max Schultz was one of four Type 1934 destroyers built for the German Navy Kriegsmarine during the mid 1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. Shortly before the beginning of World War II, the ship accidentally rammed and sank a German torpedo boat. Z3 Max Schultz spent the following month under repair. In mid February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to search for British fishing trawlers, one of her sisters, Z1 Leberecht Maass, was bombed and sunk by a patrolling German bomber, with loss of 280 of her crew. While trying to rescue survivors, Z3 Max Schultz was either bombed by a patrolling German bomber, or struck a British mine and sunk, with the loss of all 308 of her crew. A contemporary German court of inquiry stated that Z3 Max Schultz was damaged by the German bomber, however postwar research revealed that Z3 Max Schultz may have hit a mine instead.

The ship was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, on 2 January 1935 as yard number K244. She was launched on 30 November 1935 and completed on 8 April 1937. She was named after Max Schultz who commanded the torpedo boat V69 and was killed in action in January 1917. Korvettenkapitan Martin Balzer was appointed as her first captain. Z3 Max Schultz was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Division on 26 October 1937, and made a port visit to Ulvik, Norway in April 1938, together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele and Z4 Richard Beitzen. Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over it in head seas. This increased her length by .3 meters 1 ft 0 in . The ship participated in the August Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. In December, Max Schultz, together with her sisters Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z2 Georg Thiele, and Z4 Richard Beitzen, sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate their seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with their new bows. On 2324 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel. She participated in the spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Gunther Lutjens, and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. Days before the outbreak of World War II, in the early morning hours of 27 August 1939, the destroyer accidentally collided with and sank the torpedo boat Tiger near Bornholm. Two men were killed and six were wounded aboard the torpedo boat, while no one was injured aboard Z3 Max Schultz. The latter's bow was severely damaged and she had to be towed, stern first, by Z2 Georg Thiele. Two tugboats arrived a half hour later and took over the tow to Swinemunde at a speed of 4 knots 7.4 km h 4.6 mph . Z3 Max Schultz was under repair until late September and did not participate in the Polish Campaign. She patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods during October. While returning from one such patrol on 28 October, one of the ship's turbines exploded, causing boiler room No. 1 to flood and knocking out the ship's power. Attempts to tow her failed, but the ship eventually managed to restore power and she sailed to Kiel for repairs. Max Schultz, Beitzen and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area, off Harwich, on 9 10 February 1940 that sank six ships of 28,496 gross register tons GRT and damaged another. On 22 February, Z3 Max Schultz and five other destroyers, Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed for the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing vessels in Operation Wikinger . En route, the flotilla was apparently attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Bomber Wing Kampfgeschwader 26. Z1 Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew. During the rescue effort, Z3 Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 308. Hitler ordered a Court of Inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea. Postwar research revealed that one or both ships struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z3%20Max%20Schultz
"The German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen was one of four Type 1934 destroyers built for the German Navy Kriegsmarine during the mid 1930s. Completed in 1937, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939 and early 1940, the ship laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 17 merchant ships. Z4 Richard Beitzen was in reserve during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year, where she made several attacks on British shipping. The ship returned to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Z4 Richard Beitzen spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti shipping patrols in Soviet waters but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year. The ship was briefly transferred to France in early 1942 in preparation for the Channel Dash where she was one of the escorts for two battleships and a heavy cruiser as they sailed from Brest, France, through the English Channel, to Germany, before returning to Norway. Z4 Richard Beitzen escorted several heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of their anti shipping raids in 1942. She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape, Norway. Z4 Richard Beitzen spent much of 1943 escorting ships to and from Norway until she ran aground in November. Badly damaged, repairs lasted until the following August when she returned to Norway and resumed her former duties. The ship had another grounding incident in October 1944 and was under repair until February 1945. While escorting a convoy in April, she was badly damaged by aircraft and was still under repair when the war ended on 9 May. Z4 Richard Beitzen was eventually allocated to the British, when the surviving German warships were divided between the Allies after the war. They made no use of the ship before scrapping her in 1949. Design work on the Type 34 destroyers began in 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the armament limitations of the Versailles Treaty which had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships more powerful than the French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high pressure water tube boilers, were an over complicated system that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s, and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships. The class had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and were 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . They displaced 2,223 long tons 2,259 t at standard load and 3,156 long tons 3,207 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers. The ships had a design speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but their maximum was 38.7 knots 71.7 km h 44.5 mph . The Type 34s carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph but proved top heavy in service and 30 percent of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew of the Type 34 class ships numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 34s carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered from one to five from front to rear. Their anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ships carried eight 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. Z4 Richard Beitzen had four depth charge launchers mounted on the sides of her rear deckhouse, supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern, with either 32 or 64 charges carried. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. An active sonar system was scheduled to be installed in June 1940 but it is uncertain when it was done. During the war, the light anti aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2 cm C 38 guns replaced the original C 30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Z4 Richard Beitzen appears not to have had any additional AA guns added after this time. After mid 1941 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 24 search radar above the bridge. Z4 Richard Beitzen was named after Lieutenant Kapitanleutnant Richard Beitzen who commanded the 14th Torpedo Boat Flotilla in World War I and was killed in action in March 1918. The ship was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke, Kiel, on 7 January 1935 as yard number K245. She was launched on 30 November and completed on 13 May 1937. After being completed, Z4 Richard Beitzen made a port visit to Ulvik, Norway, in April 1938, together with her sister ships Z2 Georg Thiele and Z3 Max Schultz. Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over it in head seas. This increased her length by .3 meters 1 ft 0 in . The ship participated in the August Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. On 26 October, she was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla 1. Zerstorer Flottille and in December, Z4 Richard Beitzen, together with her sisters Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z2 Georg Thiele and Z3 Max Schultz, sailed to an area off the coast of Iceland to evaluate their seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with their new bows. From 23 to 24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel. She participated in the fleet exercise the next month in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. Upon her return, Z4 Richard Beitzen was accidentally rammed in the stern by the escort ship F9. When World War II began in September 1939, Z4 Richard Beitzen was initially deployed in the western Baltic to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the Kattegat to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods, beginning in mid September as one turbine was not operational. On the night of 12 13 December, German destroyers sortied to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Commodore Kommodore Friedrich Bonte in his flagship Z19 Hermann Kunne, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z8 Bruno Heinemann, Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne, where the navigation lights were still lit. The British were unaware of the minefield and lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 gross register tons GRT . En route home, the destroyers were ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nurnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. Despite their escort, the submarine HMS Ursula managed to sneak inside the anti submarine screen and fired a salvo of six torpedoes at Leipzig in the Elbe estuary the following day. Two of the torpedoes struck F9 which sank three minutes later with heavy loss of life but the other torpedoes missed. Bonte led a destroyer minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area on the night of 10 11 January with Z14 Friedrich Ihn, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z22 Anton Schmitt, Z4 Richard Beitzen and Z20 Karl Galster. Ihn had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by Z4 Richard Beitzen. This minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 tons. Z3 Max Schultz, Z4 Richard Beitzen and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area, off Harwich, on 9 10 February 1940 which sank six ships of 28,496 GRT and damaged another. On 22 February 1940, Z4 Richard Beitzen and the destroyers, Z3 Max Schultz, Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z6 Theodor Riedel, Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed for the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing vessels in Operation Wikinger. En route, the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Bomber Wing 26 Kampfgeschwader 26 . Z1 Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew. During the rescue effort, Z3 Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 308. Hitler ordered a court of inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea. Postwar research revealed that one or both ships struck British mines laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid. Z4 Richard Beitzen was held in reserve for Operation Weserubung, the German invasion of Norway on 9 April. Two days later, she escorted the light cruiser Koln home to Wilhelmshaven. The ship helped to lay a minefield in the Kattegat from 28 April to 20 May and then began a refit that lasted until September. She was transferred to Brest, France, in October. On the night of 24 25 November, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z10 Hans Lody and Z20 Karl Galster sortied from Brest, bound for the Land's End area. En route they encountered some fishing ships south west of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire with little effect. The German ships then spotted a small convoy and sank one of the three merchantmen and damaged another. The flash from the guns alerted the five destroyers of the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla but they could not intercept the German destroyers before dawn. Three nights later the German ships sortied again for the same area. They encountered two tugboats and a barge but only sank one of the former and the barge, totaling 424 GRT. This time the 5th Destroyer Flotilla was able to intercept the ships around 06 30 on 29 November. The Germans opened fire first, each destroyer firing four torpedoes, of which only two from Z10 Hans Lody hit their target, HMS Javelin. The torpedoes hit at each end of the ship and blew off her bow and stern, but the British were able to tow her home. During January 1941, the ship laid a minefield off the coast of south east England. The following month, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper on leaving and returning to Brest. Z4 Richard Beitzen departed for Kiel briefly on 16 March to begin a refit. She was then sent to Kirkenes, Norway in July 1941. As part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla 6. Zerstorer Flottille , she participated in a sortie on 1213 July that sank two small Soviet ships, at the cost of expending 80 percent of her flotilla's ammunition. Another sortie on 22 July saw Z4 Richard Beitzen sink a Soviet flying boat on the water. She was damaged by shock from near misses during another sortie on 9 August, during which the Germans sank a converted fishing trawler, and departed for Germany for repairs five days later. She escorted the battleship Tirpitz for several days in mid January 1942 as the battleship sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim, Norway. Z4 Richard Beitzen, together with the rest of the 5th Zerstorer Flotille, sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. On the evening of 25 January, Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast and sank. Z4 Richard Beitzen rescued 200 of the survivors and proceeded to Le Havre to put them ashore before reaching Brest on the 26th. The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, surprising the British. Z4 Richard Beitzen helped to repel an attack by five British destroyers and was damaged by a near miss from a Bristol Blenheim bomber that she shot down with her newly installed 2 cm Flakvierling. Shortly afterwards, the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Heavy weather forced Z4 Richard Beitzen and two other destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation. After her return, the ship needed her machinery overhauled and began a refit at Bremen on 14 March. After it was completed, she was part of the screen for the heavy cruiser Lutzow to Bogen Bay, Norway and laid a minefield in the Skaggerak en route. Z4 Richard Beitzen took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rosselsprung, an attempt to intercept Arctic convoy PQ 17 in July. Admiral Scheer and Lutzow formed one group while Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, Lutzow and three destroyers ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. Z4 Richard Beitzen, in the meantime escorted two oil tankers to the Altafjord on 23 July. During Operation Wunderland in August, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck escorted Admiral Scheer at the beginning and end of its mission to attack Soviet shipping in the Kara Sea. The ships also escorted the minelayer Ulm as it departed to lay a minefield off Cape Zhelaniya in mid August. On 1315 October, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and the destroyers Z27 and Z30 laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea that sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November. During Operation Regenbogen, the attempt to intercept Convoy JW 51B sailing from the UK to the Soviet Union in late December, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and the destroyer Z29 escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to divert the convoy escorts while Lutzow and three other destroyers attacked. The three destroyers separated from Admiral Hipper to search for the convoy, which they found on the morning of 31 December. The destroyer HMS Obdurate spotted them in turn and closed to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a range of 8,000 meters 8,700 yd . Obdurate turned away to rejoin the convoy without sustaining any damage and the German ships did not pursue as they had been ordered to rejoin Hipper. The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble, which had been detached earlier from the convoy to search for stragglers, as they maneuvered to close with the convoy and the destroyers were ordered to sink her, while Hipper engaged the convoy escorts. This took some time in the poor visibility and Hipper was surprised in the meantime by the British covering force of the light cruisers Sheffield and Jamaica. After sinking Bramble, the German destroyers attempted to rejoin Hipper but had no idea that British cruisers were in the area. They confused Sheffield with Hipper when they spotted each other at 4,000 meters 4,400 yd range and were surprised when Sheffield opened fire on Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt with every gun she possessed, sinking her with the loss of all hands. Z4 Richard Beitzen was not engaged before she escaped into the darkness. Commander Fregattenkapitan Hans Dominik assumed command in January 1943 and the ship escorted the damaged Admiral Hipper and Koln down to Kristiansand at the end of the month. She began escorting convoys between that port and Aarhus, Denmark, before she escorted the battleship Scharnhorst to Altafjord in early March. The following month she screened Nurnberg during the latter's return to the Baltic and began a refit at Swinemunde that lasted until October. Returning to the Arctic, she ran aground in the Karmsund on 27 October, suffering extensive damage. Z4 Richard Beitzen was refloated on 5 November and towed to Haugesund for emergency repairs. She reached Bergen on 26 November for temporary repairs that took until 18 December. The ship arrived at Stettin five days later but repairs, which included fitting a new bow, did not begin until 17 January as the dry dock was busy. The repairs were completed in June but machinery problems meant that she was not operational again until 5 August when she reached Horten, Norway. Z4 Richard Beitzen resumed escort work and laid mines in the Skagerrak until she ran aground again in November. Repairs were slow and she was not fully operational until 15 February 1945. The ship was badly damaged by radar equipped bombers while screening a convoy on the morning of 24 April and put into Oslo, Norway, for repairs that were not completed before the end of the war. Z4 Richard Beitzen was captured by the British on 14 May and temporarily turned over to the Royal Norwegian Navy on 15 July, while the Allies decided on the disposition of captured German ships. She was allocated to Britain at the end of 1945 and was then towed to Rosyth in February 1946. Z4 Richard Beitzen was ordered to be used as a target in September, but a serious leak three months later, caused her to be beached lest she sink. Temporary repairs were made and she was allocated for disposal in January 1947. The ship was allocated to C. W. Dorkin for breaking up the following year and she was towed to their facility in Gateshead on 10 January 1949.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z4%20Richard%20Beitzen
"Z5 Paul Jacobi was a Type 1934A destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. The ship was being refitted when World War II began on 1 September 1939 and was tasked to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in the Kattegat until early 1940. She participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where she made several attacks on British shipping. Paul Jacobi spent most of 1941 under repair and returned to France in early 1942 to successfully escort two German battleships and a heavy cruiser home through the English Channel the Channel Dash . The following month, the ship helped to escort another German battleship to northern Norway and returned in May to begin another lengthy refit. Paul Jacobi spent most of 1943 inactive in the Arctic before returning to Germany in September for another refit. She was badly damaged by Allied air attacks on Kiel and was not operational again until late 1944. She spent most of the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships. Paul Jacobi was ultimately allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Desaix. She became operational later that year, but her service with the French Navy was fairly brief, with only cruises to French colonies in Africa during 1947 of note before she was paid off in late 1948 and placed in reserve in early 1949. The ship was used as a source of spare parts of the other ex German ships in French service until she was condemned and sold for scrap in 1954. Z5 Paul Jacobi had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. At some point before September 1939, her stem was lengthened, which increased her overall length to 120 meters 393 ft 8 in . The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 long tons 2,206 t at standard load and 3,110 long tons 3,160 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six high pressure Wagner boilers. The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but her maximum speed was 38.7 knots 71.7 km h 44.5 mph . Paul Jacobi carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Paul Jacobi carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. An active sonar system was probably installed by the end of 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2 cm C 38 guns replaced the original C 30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her mid 1942 refit. During 194445, Paul Jacobi was one of the few destroyers to receive the full Barbara anti aircraft refit in which all of her existing 3.7 cm and most of her 2 cm guns were replaced with improved models in greater numbers. The fifth 12.7 cm gun was removed to compensate for the weight of the additional weapons. She retained her Flakvierling mount and, by the end of the war, the rest of her anti aircraft armament consisted of four twin and two single 3.7 cm SK M 42 mounts, four twin and one single 2 cm mounts on the forecastle and sides of the bridge. Z5 Paul Jacobi, named after Paul Jacobi, was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG, Bremen on 15 July 1935 as yard number W899. She was launched on 24 March 1936 and completed on 29 June 1937. The ship participated in the late 1937 naval maneuvers as part of the Second Destroyer Division 2. Zerstorerdivision . Z5 Paul Jacobi and her sister ship Z8 Bruno Heinemann sailed to Norway in April 1938 to test the new 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 gun planned for later classes of destroyers. Z8 Bruno Heinemann had been fitted with four of the new weapons and they were removed after gunnery trials off Alesund were completed. Z5 Paul Jacobi participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 2nd Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise. The division accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee on her voyage to the Mediterranean in October where they visited Vigo, Tangiers, and Ceuta before returning home. The destroyer had a lengthy refit at Wilhelmshaven from February 1939 to 29 September. After she finished working up on 11 October, Paul Jacobi was tasked to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in the Skaggerak until February 1940 between visits to the shipyard. The ship was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment Gebirgsjager Regiment 138 of the 3rd Mountain Division to seize Trondheim together with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Paul Jacobi and her sisters Bruno Heinemann and Theodor Riedel each carried a company of mountain troops tasked to seize the forts defending the entrance to the Trondheimsfjord. En route the weather was so bad that Paul Jacobi rolled so far to port that water flooded the port boiler intakes, temporarily shutting down the port engine, and washing five men overboard. After passing the surprised forts the ships were able to land their troops and capture the forts with little difficulty. All of the destroyers had suffered storm damage en route and were low on fuel because none of the oil tankers had arrived yet. Admiral Hipper was ordered home on 10 April. Fuel was transferred from Paul Jacobi and Bruno Heinemann to Friedrich Eckoldt, enough to allow her to escort the cruiser home. Paul Jacobi remained in Trondheim until early May with engine troubles. Her aft torpedo tubes were removed and remounted on a pair of impounded small boats to improve the local defenses. In 1941 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 21 search radar above the bridge. She arrived at Wilhelmshaven on 10 May and spent the next month under repair. Paul Jacobi returned to Trondheim on 30 June and helped to screen the crippled battleship Gneisenau as she returned to Kiel on 25 July. The ship laid a minefield in the North Sea before she was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid September. Now based at Brest the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Paul Jacobi arrived back at Wilhelmshaven to begin a lengthy refit that lasted until October 1941. While departing Aarhus, Denmark for Norway, she fouled a buoy that damaged her port propeller and had to return to Kiel for repairs that took until 24 November. After loading mines at Aarhus, she had a boiler breakdown and had to return to Germany. While docked at Wilhelmshaven on 29 December, Paul Jacobi was slightly damaged by bomb splinters that also killed three crewmen. She escorted the battleship Tirpitz for several days in mid January 1942 as the battleship sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim. Paul Jacobi, together with the rest of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. On the evening of 25 January, Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast and sank. Paul Jacobi rescued 34 of the survivors and proceeded to Le Havre to put them ashore before reaching Brest on the 26th. The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, totally surprising the British. Paul Jacobi helped to repel an attack by five British destroyers and evaded a series of aerial attacks without damage. Shortly afterwards, the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Heavy weather forced Paul Jacobi and two other destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation. On 6 March, the battleship Tirpitz, escorted by Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers, sortied to attack the returning convoy QP 8 and the Russia bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast Sports Palace , but the ship was ordered back to port that evening. Two months later, in Operation Zauberflote Magic Flute , Paul Jacobi, the destroyer Z25, and two torpedo boats escorted the badly damaged heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Trondheim to Kiel from 1618 May. Two days after her arrival, the destroyer began a lengthy refit that lasted until December. On 9 January 1943, together with two other destroyers, she escorted Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen as they attempted to return to Norway from Gotenhafen. The ships were spotted en route two days later by an aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the attempt was abandoned as the element of surprise was lost. The following month, Paul Jacobi made her way independently to Bogen Bay, Norway. She screened the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, as well as Lutzow to the Altafjord, closer to the Allied convoy routes to Russia, in mid March. Two weeks later, the ship, her sister Z6 Theodor Riedel, and the destroyer Z20 Karl Galster sailed for Jan Mayen island on 31 March to rendezvous with the blockade runner, MV Regensburg. They searched for several days before increasingly heavy weather forced them to return to port with storm damage. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Regensburg had been intercepted and sunk by a British cruiser on 30 March. Paul Jacobi escorted Lutzow back to Kiel in September and then began yet another lengthy refit on 30 September. The ship was badly damaged during an air raid on Kiel on 13 December. One bomb struck the forecastle and started a severe fire while four others landed inside the dry dock itself, riddling her with splinters and sinking the ship. Paul Jacobi was not refloated until April and the refit itself was not completed until November. The ship had to be fitted with a new bow section, her radar was replaced by a FuMO 24 search radar and her foremast was rebuilt in a goal post shape to allow the 6 by 2 meter 19.7 ft 6.6 ft antenna to fully rotate. A FuMO 63 K Hohentwiel radar replaced the searchlight on its platform abaft the rear funnel. After being damaged again by bomb splinters during an air raid on 18 July, she was towed to Swinemunde to be completed. Paul Jacobi was declared operational on 13 November and she escorted the hospital ship SS General von Steuben from Gotenhafen to Swinemunde. The destroyer's new 3.7 cm guns were installed on 20 December. While conducting torpedo training off the Swedish island of Gotland on 14 January 1945, one of her torpedoes circled back around and hit Paul Jacobi, inflicting only minor damage. She was back in action by the 19th, escorting ships in the eastern Baltic Sea. During one of these missions, the ship was accidentally rammed in the stern by the freighter SS Helga Schroder. Repairs took until 27 February to complete, and the Kriegsmarine took advantage of the opportunity to add more AA guns. Paul Jacobi bombarded Soviet forces on 69 March and alternated between bombardment and escort tasks for the rest of the war as the Germans evacuated East Prussia in the face of advancing Soviet armies. On 2 May, her gyrocompass was sabotaged by some of her crew to prevent the ship from screening the last few refugee convoys. Three men were convicted by a drumhead court martial and sentenced to death by Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Bernhard Rogge. Paul Jacobi was decommissioned five days later at Flensburg and sailed to Wilhelmshaven under British control on 21 May to have her fate determined. France was initially denied any of the captured ships, but eventually received Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers. She arrived in Cherbourg on 15 January 1946 and was turned over to the French on 4 February. Renamed Desaix that same day, after General Louis Desaix, the ship was assigned to the 1st Division of Large Destroyers contre torpilleurs and conducted trials in September. In MarchJune 1947, she formed part of the escort for the battleship Richelieu as the President of France, Vincent Auriol, visited West and North Africa. Desaix visited North Africa by herself later that year. She took part in the spring naval maneuvers in 1948 and in a naval review for Auriol off Brest on 30 May. The ship was present in Saint Malo during the commemoration of the centenary of the death of Francois Rene de Chateaubriand and she visited Bordeaux before returning to Cherbourg on 4 November. Desaix was decommissioned before the end of the year and reduced to reserve in January 1949. She was used as a source of spare parts until she was condemned on 17 February 1954. Her hulk was redesignated as Q02 and she was sold for scrap in June. She was towed to Rouen for demolition.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z5%20Paul%20Jacobi
"The German destroyer Z6 Theodor Riedel was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine during the mid 1930s. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, the ship laid defensive minefields to the North Sea. She covered her sister ships over the next few months as they laid offensive minefields in English waters in late 1939early 1940. She participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where the ship covered another minelaying sortie before engine problems caused her to return to Germany in November for repairs. Theodor Riedel was badly damaged when she ran aground three days after her repairs were completed and was out of action until May 1942. The ship was transferred to Norway in 1942 and ran aground yet again as she prepared to attack one of the convoys to Russia in July. Repairs were completed in December and Theodor Riedel participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year and in the German attack on Spitzbergen in mid 1943. After another lengthy refit, the ship began escorting ships between Denmark and Norway in mid 1944 and continued to do so until May 1945 when she made several trips to rescue refugees from East Prussia before the end of the war on 8 May. Theodor Riedel spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships and was ultimately allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Kleber. She became operational later that year, but she was reconstructed and modernized in Cherbourg in 194851. After its completion, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron for several years. Kleber was placed in reserve in late 1953, but was not condemned until 1957 and scrapped the next year. Z6 Theodor Riedel had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. At some point before September 1939, her stem was lengthened, which increased her overall length to 120 meters 393 ft 8 in .

The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six high pressure Wagner boilers. The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph and she reached a maximum speed of 36.4 knots from 72,100 shaft horsepower 53,765 kW during her sea trials. Theodor Riedel carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship.

The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably sometime during 1942. It is not certain if the improved 3.7 cm SK M 42 gun replaced her original 3.7 cm guns, but Theodor Riedel had one quadruple, two twin and six single mounts for 2 cm guns by the end of the war. Theodor Riedel, named after Lieutenant Korvettenkapitan Theodor Riedel, was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG, Bremen on 18 July 1935 as yard number W900. She was launched on 22 April 1936 and completed on 2 July 1937. The ship participated in the late 1937 naval maneuvers and while training with the 2nd Destroyer Division 2. Zerstorer Division ran aground on 8 June 1938 near Heligoland island. The impact badly damaged her bottom, both propellers and knocked the port turbine out of alignment. Towed to Wilhelmshaven for repairs, the dockyard was unable to fully repair the turbine's foundations and it had problems with its thrust bearings until a new turbine was fitted in 1943. Theodor Riedel participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 2nd Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise. The division accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee on her voyage to the Mediterranean in October where they visited Vigo, Tangiers, and Ceuta before returning home. The destroyer had a lengthy refit at Wilhelmshaven from February 1939 to August. When World War II began, the ship began laying defensive minefields in the German Bight with her sister ships. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted to lay a minefield off the British coast on the night of 12 13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z7 Hermann Schoemann suffered machinery breakdowns. Theodor Riedel covered another such operation on the night of 10 11 February 1940. On 22 February 1940, Theodor Riedel and five other destroyers, Z3 Max Schultz, Z1 Leberecht Maass, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z13 Erich Koellner and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, sailed for the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing vessels in Operation Wikinger . En route, the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Bomber Wing 26 Kampfgeschwader 26 . Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew. During the rescue effort, Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 308. Hitler ordered a Court of Inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea. Postwar evidence revealed that one or both ships struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid. Theodor Riedel was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment Gebirgsjager Regiment 1383rd Mountain Division to seize Trondheim together with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Theodor Riedel and her sisters Z8 Bruno Heinemann and Z5 Paul Jacobi each carried a company of mountain troops tasked to seize the forts defending the entrance to the Trondheimsfjord. After passing the surprised forts the ships were able to land their troops and capture the forts with little difficulty. All of the destroyers had suffered storm damage en route and were low on fuel because none of the oil tankers had arrived yet. To defend the port after Admiral Hipper departed, Theodor Riedel was beached on a sandbar on 10 April as a stationary artillery and torpedo battery. The following day she was attacked by nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 816 Squadron from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious. They were very surprised to see their torpedoes detonate short of the ship as they struck the sandy rocks. She was refloated 10 days later and towed to Trondheim for repairs. There she was the first German destroyer to receive a FuMO 21 search radar and one set of torpedo tubes was removed and remounted on land near Agdenes to improve the local defenses. On 7 June the work was finished and Theodor Riedel went to Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul. She was transferred to France, departing on 9 September. Now based at Brest, the ship covered the laying of a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September that ultimately sank five ships totaling only 2,026 gross register tons GRT . Theodor Riedel was plagued by problems with her port engine and sailed for Wilhelmshaven on 5 November 1940 for repairs. Having been hit by a practice torpedo and further damaged by a boiler room fire, the repairs took until 9 August. She departed for Norway three days later, but struck an uncharted reef that ripped open her bottom in seven compartments and caused both propeller shafts to seize up. The ship was towed to Bergen for temporary repairs and then to Kiel where repairs lasted until 10 May 1942. Theodor Riedel departed for Norway on 11 June and she was one of four destroyers assigned to escort the battleship Tirpitz during Operation Rosselsprung Knight's Move , an attack on the Russia bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although three of the destroyers, including Theodor Riedel, assigned to Tirpitz's escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for repairs. Coupled with the damage suffered by the heavy cruiser Lutzow when she ran aground the same day, the operation was canceled shortly afterwards. Theodor Riedel was temporarily repaired at Trondheim and was towed back to Germany for permanent repairs on 25 July. Three days later they were attacked without effect by three British Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The ship was operational again in December and she returned to Norway, together with Lutzow, in time to participate in Operation Regenbogen, an attempt to intercept Convoy JW 51B sailing from the UK to the Soviet Union in late December. After the convoy was spotted on the morning of 31 December. Theodor Riedel, Lutzow, and two other destroyers were tasked to engage the convoy while Admiral Hipper and three other destroyers attempted to occupy the attention of the convoy's escort. The Germans failed to press home their attack and only sank one destroyer, a minesweeper and damage one merchantman while losing one of their own destroyers. Theodor Riedel escorted the minelayer Brummer in early February 1943 as the latter laid a minefield near Kildin Island in the Barents Sea. The following month, the ship, her sister Paul Jacobi, and the destroyer Z20 Karl Galster sailed for Jan Mayen island on 31 March to rendezvous with the blockade runner, MV Regensburg. They searched for several days before increasingly heavy weather forced them to return to port with storm damage. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Regensburg had been intercepted and sunk by a British cruiser on 30 March. Theodor Riedel then sailed for Trondheim for repairs, but was nearly lost en route on 6 April when water contamination of her fuel caused her to lose all power. Only the timely arrival of a tug prevented her from drifting ashore. In September the ship participated in Operation Zitronella, ferrying troops of the 349th Grenadier Regiment Grenadier Regiment 349 of the 230th Infantry Division to destroy Norwegian facilities on the island of Spitzbergen, together with Tirpitz and the battleship Scharnhorst, escorted by eight other destroyers. While successful, the operation was primarily intended to boost the morale of the ships stationed in the Arctic when fuel shortages limited their activities and the Allies reestablished the bases five weeks later. Theodor Riedel escorted convoys in and around the Skagerrak until she returned to Germany in early December for another overhaul. After her overhaul was completed in June 1944, the ship resumed her former duties in the Skagerrak, although the repairs required after another boiler room fire in August necessitated lengthy repairs in Oslo. She was damaged after colliding with the mole in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 November and became operational again on 7 January 1945. Theodor Riedel remained in Southern Norway and Denmark until the ships there were ordered into the Baltic to assist with the evacuation of the Hel Peninsula on 5 May. After unloading the refugees in Copenhagen, she made another voyage to Hela and returned to Copenhagen on 7 May. The crew surrendered in Kiel three days later. The ship, now under British command with German crewmembers on board, was overhauled in Wilhelmshaven in June 1945, while her fate was determined. She was initially allocated to Great Britain at the end of 1945 and sailed to Rosyth in mid January. In the meantime, France had protested and she was given Theodor Riedel and three other destroyers. The ships were formally handed over at Cherbourg on 4 February 1946 and renamed Kleber, after General Jean Baptiste Kleber. Kleber was given a brief refit on 31 August10 September and then made a training cruise to Bordeaux between 28 October and 21 December. During this voyage, she rescued the crew of the collier SS France Helene on 31 October. The ship was assigned to the 1st Division of Large Destroyers contre torpilleurs in 1947 and received the pennant number of T03. Late that year she escorted the submarine Doris to Londonderry to be returned to the British in November, returning to Cherbourg by 25 November. Kleber was reconstructed in 194851 during which her bridge was enlarged, her original light AA weapons were replaced by six single 40 millimeter 1.6 in Bofors guns, her fifth 12.7 cm gun was removed, and American radars were fitted. She sailed from Cherbourg to her new base at Toulon on 20 December. Now assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Division of the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship made numerous port visits in French North Africa over the next two years. Kleber was transferred back to Cherbourg in October 1953 and she was reduced to reserve on 20 December. Her condition was evaluated in 1957 and her hull was found to be in very poor condition so she was condemned on 10 April and hulked as Q85 the same day. She was broken up in Rouen the following year.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z6%20Theodor%20Riedel
"Z7 Hermann Schoemann was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. The ship was plagued by machinery problems for most of her life and was under repair when World War 2 began in September 1939. She covered her sister ships over the next few months as they laid offensive minefields in English waters in late 1939early 1940. Hermann Schoemann played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign as engine problems limited her availability throughout 1940 and for most of 1941. She was transferred to France in early 1942 to escort two battleships and a heavy cruiser home to Germany through the English Channel in the Channel Dash. The ship was then transferred to Norway where she participated in Operation Sportpalast Sports Palace , an unsuccessful attempt to intercept Convoy QP 8 returning from Russia. Another unsuccessful intercept was made in early April before the Germans were successful with Convoy QP 11 at the end of the month. The convoy's escorts conducted a skillful defense and prevented Hermann Schoemann and the other two destroyers from sinking more than a single Soviet freighter. The German commander broke off the action in the hopes of locating the crippled light cruiser HMS Edinburgh. They found the cruiser and her escorting destroyers on 2 May Edinburgh disabled Hermann Schoemann before she could fire any torpedoes and her captain was forced to scuttle her shortly afterwards. The destroyer had 8 men killed and 45 wounded in the engagement. Hermann Schoemann had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 long tons 2,206 t at standard load and 3,110 long tons 3,160 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six high pressure Wagner boilers. The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph and she reached a maximum speed of 36.8 knots from 66,000 shp 49,000 kW while testing various propellers. Hermann Schoemann carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Hermann Schoemann carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines and the S Gerat active sonar system was scheduled to be installed during March 1940. Z7 Hermann Schoemann, named after Lieutenant Kapitanleutnant Hermann Schoemann, was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG, Bremen on 7 September 1935 as yard number W901. She was launched on 16 July 1936 and completed on 9 September 1937 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Erich Schulte Monting. The ship participated in the late 1937 naval maneuvers as part of the 2nd Destroyer Division 2. Zerstorer Division . Hermann Schoemann hosted Adolf Hitler and his retinue for a short cruise from Kiel to Eckernforde in July 1938 and participated in the August Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise. Korvettenkapitan Theodor Detmers relieved Schulte Monting in October. The division accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee on her voyage to the Mediterranean in October where they visited Vigo, Tangiers, and Ceuta before returning home. The destroyer had a lengthy refit at Wilhelmshaven from February 1939 to October. Hermann Schoemann patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted to lay a minefield off the British coast on the night of 12 13 November, with two of her sisters, but had to turn back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt on the night of 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie when they could not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck in a heavy fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems. The ship was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment 138. Gebirgsjager Regiment of the 3rd Mountain Division to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper, but her machinery broke down again before the troops were loaded and she was replaced by Friedrich Eckoldt. As part of the post Narvik reorganization of the Kriegsmarine's destroyer forces, Hermann Schoemann was assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla 6. Zerstorer Flotille . In June the flotilla was tasked to escort the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper in Operation Juno, a planned attack on Harstad, Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at Narvik. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the troop transport Orama, the oil tanker Oil Pioneer and the minesweeping trawler Juniper en route. The German commander, Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, then ordered the Admiral Hipper and all four destroyers to Trondheim because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. The two battleships continued the sortie and sank the aircraft carrier Glorious and her two escorting destroyers, although Scharnhorst was badly damaged by a torpedo from the destroyer Acasta in the engagement. The battleship was escorted home by the destroyers Steinbrinck, Z10 Hans Lody and Hermann Schoemann for repairs. On 25 June, Hermann Schoemann began a lengthy refit that lasted until 15 February 1941, although her machinery continued to be problematic. She was declared operational in June and transferred to Kirkenes, Norway, the following month. However, continued machinery problems forced her return to Germany in August and repairs that lasted until January 1942. Now assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla 5. Zerstorer Flotille , Hermann Schoemann sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. On the evening of 25 January, Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast and sank. The survivors were put ashore at Le Havre before the flotilla reached Brest on the 26th. The German ships departed on the evening of 11 February and the nighttime and morning portion of the transit through the English Channel was uneventful. In the afternoon, however, Hermann Schoemann twice drove off British Motor Torpedo Boats, together with her sister Z14 Friedrich Ihn. British aircraft began to make their presence known with repeated attacks on the German ships. Hermann Schoemann was repeatedly struck in the stern by 20 mm cannon shells from defending German fighters and or No. 452 Squadron RAAF Spitfires. Later that afternoon, Vice Admiral Vizeadmiral Otto Ciliax, commander of the battleship flotilla, was transferred to the ship after his temporary flagship, the destroyer Z29, was disabled by a premature detonation in one of her guns that sent shrapnel into the machinery spaces. Shortly afterwards, Hermann Schoemann joined four other destroyers in escorting the heavy cruisers Prinz Eugen and Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Heavy weather forced three of the destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine HMS Trident on 23 February after their separation. On 6 March, the battleship Tirpitz, escorted by Hermann Schoemann and three other destroyers, sortied from Trondheim to attack the returning Convoy QP 8 and the Russia bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast. The following morning, Ciliax ordered the destroyers to search independently for Allied ships and they stumbled across the 2,815 gross register ton GRT Soviet freighter Ijora, a straggler from QP 8, later that afternoon and sank her. Tirpitz rejoined them shortly afterwards and they continued to fruitlessly search for Allied shipping until they sailed for the Vestfjorden on the 9th. On 9 April, the ship was transferred to the 8th Destroyer Flotilla 8. Zerstorer Flotille in Kirkenes. Together with the destroyers Z24 and Z25, Hermann Schoemann sortied to intercept Convoy QP 14 two days later, but failed to locate any Allied ships in heavy snow and low visibility. The trio sortied again on 30 April to intercept the westbound Convoy QP 11 and the crippled light cruiser HMS Edinburgh, torpedoed earlier by the German submarine U 456. They found the convoy the next day, but they only managed to sink a Soviet 2,847 GRT freighter as the convoy's four escorting destroyers repeatedly rebuffed attempts to reach the convoy's ships. Despite a significant firepower advantage, the Germans only moderately damaged HMS Amazon in the day's engagements. Captain Kapitan zur See Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, commander of the flotilla, broke off the battle in the late afternoon and decided to search for the cruiser, his original objective. They found Edinburgh and her escorts on the morning of 2 May and closed to attack with torpedoes. The cruiser opened fire first and disabled Hermann Schoemann with her second salvo with hits in both engine rooms. The destroyer turned away and dropped smoke floats to create a smoke screen behind which she could hide. The damage was too severe to return to base and, as the crew prepared to abandon ship, Hermann Schoemann was attacked by the British destroyers who hit her at least three more times. Z24 and Z25 took off about 223 survivors before the ship was scuttled by her crew at coordinates 7220N 3505E 72.333N 35.083E 72.333 35.083Coordinates 7220N 3505E 72.333N 35.083E 72.333 35.083. Another 56 men were rescued by U 88 after the German destroyers broke off the engagement. During the battle 8 men were killed and another 45 wounded.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z7%20Hermann%20Schoemann
"Z8 Bruno Heinemann was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. After the start of World War II in September 1939, she blockaded the Polish coast and searched neutral shipping for contraband. In late 1939 and early 1940 the ship made three successful minelaying sorties off the English coast that claimed 17 merchant ships. Bruno Heinemann participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940. The ship was transferred to France a year later to escort German ships that used the French ports on the Atlantic coast. She was returning to France in early 1942 when she struck two mines and sank off the coast of Belgium. Bruno Heinemann had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 metric tons 2,137 long tons at standard and 3,110 metric tons 3,060 long tons at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,485 kW 69,042 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Wagner boilers with superheaters. Bruno Heinemann carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nmi 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Bruno Heinemann carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' German Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. The ship was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG, Bremen on 14 January 1936 as yard number W902. She was launched on 15 September 1936 and completed on 8 January 1937. Bruno Heinemann and her sister Z5 Paul Jakobi sailed to Norway in April 1938 to test the new 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 gun planned for later classes of destroyers. Bruno Heinemann had been fitted with four of the new weapons and they were removed after gunnery trials off Alesund were completed. The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 6th Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise. Early in 1939, she spent several months in the Baltic Sea to evaluate whether reduced steam pressure would solve some of the problems of her high pressure steam plant. When World War II began, Bruno Heinemann was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods and was also briefly refitted during this time. After completing her refit, Bruno Heinemann and Paul Jakobi were bound for the Baltic via the Kiel Canal when they were attacked by 11 Handley Page Hampden bombers of No. 144 Squadron RAF on 29 September. The British aircraft failed to damage the German ships and five were shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters. Although the other destroyers were busy escorting the German heavy ships and laying minefields off the British coast in October and November, Bruno Heinemann played no part of any of these operations until the night of 12 13 December. Under the command of Commodore Friedrich Bonte in his flagship Hermann Kunne, Bruno Heinemann, Richard Beitzen, Friedrich Ihn, and Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne, where the navigation lights were still lit. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 Gross Register Tons GRT . While withdrawing at high speed Bruno Heinemann suffered a serious fire in one of her turbine rooms and was ordered to heave to while the fire was put out. The destroyers were later ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nurnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. Despite their escort, the submarine HMS Ursula managed to sneak inside the anti submarine screen and fired a salvo of six torpedoes at Leipzig in the Elbe estuary. Two of the torpedoes struck the destroyer escort F9 which sank three minutes later with heavy loss of life, but the other torpedoes missed. On the night of 10 11 January 1940 the ship laid a minefield off Cromer with her sisters Wolfgang Zenker and Erich Koellner. Three ships totaling 11,155 GRT were sunk by this minefield. The same three ships made another sortie on the night of 9 10 February into the same area and laid 157 mines that claimed three more ships totaling 11,855 GRT. Bruno Heinemann was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment 138. Gebirgsjager Regiment to seize Trondheim together with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Bruno Heinemann and her sisters Paul Jakobi and Theodor Riedel each carried a company of mountain troops tasked to seize the forts defending the entrance to the Trondheimsfjord. After passing the surprised forts the ships were able to land their troops and capture the forts with little difficulty. All of the destroyers had suffered storm damage en route and were low on fuel because none of the oil tankers had arrived yet. Admiral Hipper was ordered home on 10 April. Fuel was transferred from Bruno Heinemann and Paul Jakobi to Friedrich Eckoldt sufficient to give the heavy cruiser some anti submarine protection. However, even this proved to be insufficient fuel, so the Friedrich Eckoldt was ordered to return later that night. Two days later enough fuel had been found in Trondheim to allow Friedrich Eckoldt and Bruno Heinemann to sail on 14 April they reached Germany the next day without incident. Sometime in 193941 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge. The ship escorted a force of minelayers on the nights of 29 30 April and 9 10 May 1940 in the vicinity of the Great Fisherman's Bank, but the second sortie turned back when British destroyers were spotted. Bruno Heinemann began a lengthy refit later that month and she was still not combat worthy in November. On 5 April 1941, Bruno Heinemann left Germany for Occupied France and she was attacked by two torpedo bombers en route, but suffered no damage. The ship and the other destroyers present escorted commerce raiders, blockade runners and major warships as they used the French Atlantic coast ports until she was recalled on 6 September for another refit. Bruno Heinemann probably was fitted at this time with a four barrel 2 centimeter AA gun on her aft deckhouse that replaced the pair of 2 centimeter guns originally mounted there. She escorted the battleship Tirpitz in mid January 1942 as she sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim. Bruno Heinemann, together with the rest of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. On the evening of 25 January, she struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast. The first detonated beneath the ship and knocked out Nos. 2 and 3 boiler rooms and the second blew the ship's bow off shortly afterwards. 98 members of the ship's crew lost their lives 93 were lost at sea, while another five, who had originally been among the 234 men rescued, died of their wounds.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z8%20Bruno%20Heinemann
"Z9 Wolfgang Zenker was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. Several days after the start of World War II, she unsuccessfully attacked, together with another destroyer, Polish ships anchored at the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. In early 1940 the ship made two successful minelaying sorties off the English coast that claimed six merchant ships. Wolfgang Zenker participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Narvik area in early April 1940. The ship fought in both naval Battles of Narvik several days later and had to be scuttled after she exhausted her ammunition. Wolfgang Zenker had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 metric tons 2,137 long tons at standard and 3,110 metric tons 3,060 long tons at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Wolfgang Zenker carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nmi 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Wolfgang Zenker carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' German Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines. The ship was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 22 March 1935 as yard number G535. She was launched on 27 March 1936 and completed on 2 July 1938. Wolfgang Zenker participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 6th Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise. On the morning of 3 September 1939, after the start of World War II, the destroyers Leberecht Maass and Wolfgang Zenker, under the command of Rear Admiral Gunther Lutjens, attacked the Polish destroyer Wicher and the minelayer Gryf as they laid anchored in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. The German ships opened fire at a range of 12,700 meters 13,900 yd . The Polish ships, as well as a coast defense battery of 15 centimeter 5.9 in replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a smoke screen to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. A 15 centimeter shell struck Leberecht Maass, killing four men and disabling one gun. Admiral Lutjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective. Although the other destroyers were busy escorting the German heavy ships and laying minefields off the British coast, Wolfgang Zenker played no part of any of these operations until the night of 10 11 January 1940 when she laid a minefield off Cromer with her sisters Bruno Heinemann and Erich Koellner. Three ships totaling 11,155 Gross Register Tons GRT were sunk by this minefield. The same three ships made another sortie on the night of 9 10 February into the same area and laid 157 mines that claimed three ships totaling 11,855 GRT. Wolfgang Zenker suffered ice damage in mid February and was forced to return prematurely when she was escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst when they attempted to intercept British convoys to Scandinavia. Wolfgang Zenker was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. When they arrived at the Ofotfjord, west of Narvik, on the early morning of 9 April, the three ships of the 4th Flotilla, under the command of Commander Erich Bey, were ordered to land their troops in the Herjangsfjord a northern branch of the Ofotfjord in order to capture a Norwegian Army armory at Elvegardsmoen. The troops encountered little resistance, but off loading them was slow because there was only a single wooden pier available. Wolfgang Zenker was able to partially refuel during the following night, but returned to the Herjansfjord well before dawn. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik. Commander Bey's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, so he decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1. Commander Bey was ordered during the afternoon of 10 April to return to Germany with all seaworthy ships that evening. Only Wolfgang Zenker and her sister Erich Giese were ready for sea and they slipped out of the Ofotfjord and turned south. Visibility was good that evening and they spotted the light cruiser HMS Penelope and her two escorting destroyers and Commander Bey decided to turn back even though his ships had not been spotted by the British. Three other destroyers refuelled and completed their repairs on 11 April, but Bey decided against another breakout attempt despite the fog and poor visibility that night. While at anchor, Wolfgang Zenker briefly grounded during the night and damaged her port propeller, which limited her speed to 20 knots 37 km h 23 mph . Bey made no attempt to breakout during the night of 12 13 April. That night he received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. Wolfgang Zenker was still under repair, although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers. The battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including Wolfgang Zenker, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. Wolfgang Zenker was able to make a torpedo attack on Warspite before being driven off, but her torpedoes all missed. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord , east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. Wolfgang Zenker had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the fjord. Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship. By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z9%20Wolfgang%20Zenker
"Z10 Hans Lody was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. At the beginning of World War II on 1 September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the North Sea to lay defensive minefields. In late 1939 the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed nine merchant ships and she crippled a British destroyer during one of these missions. Hans Lody was under repair for most of the Norwegian Campaign and was transferred to France in late 1940 where she participated in several engagements with British ships, crippling another destroyer. The ship returned to Germany in late 1940 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June 1941 as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Hans Lody spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti shipping patrols in Soviet waters, but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year before returning to Germany in September for machinery repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid 1942, but was badly damaged when she ran aground in July and did not return until April 1943. Hans Lody participated in the German attack Operation Zitronella on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle and then spent the next six months on convoy duties in southern Norway. The ship began a lengthy refit in April 1944 and was not operational for the next year. She spent April 1945 escorting convoys in Danish waters before making one voyage to rescue refugees in East Prussia in May. Hans Lody was assigned to the Royal Navy after the war and used as a training ship and then a barracks ship before being broken up for scrap in 1949. Z10 Hans Lody had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 long tons 2,206 t at standard load and 3,110 long tons 3,160 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six high pressure Wagner boilers. The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph and she reached a maximum speed of 37.8 knots from 65,000 shp 48,000 kW during her sea trials. Hans Lody carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots. The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Hans Lody carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines and the S Gerat active sonar system was scheduled to be installed during February 1940. During the war the ship's light anti aircraft armament was augmented several times. In 1941, improved 2 cm C 38 guns replaced the original C 30 guns and three additional guns were added. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced at some point by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably in 1942. During her 194445 refit, Hans Lody received the Barbara anti aircraft refit in which all of her existing 3.7 cm and most of her 2 cm guns were replaced. She retained her Flakvierling mount and the remainder of her anti aircraft armament now consisted of seven twin 3.7 cm SK M 42 mounts and three twin 2 cm mounts. Z10 Hans Lody, named after naval reservist Carl Hans Lody who was executed by the British as a spy during World War I, was ordered on 4 August 1934 and laid down at Germaniawerft, Kiel, on 1 April 1935 as yard number G536. She was launched on 14 May 1936 and completed on 13 September 1938. The destroyer was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Division 8. Zerstorerdivision upon completion and participated in the homecoming celebrations for the Condor Legion on 30 May 1939 under her first commander, Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Karl Jesko von Puttkamer. When World War II began in September 1939, Hans Lody was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. While loading mines on 4 September, one exploded aboard Hans Lody, killing two crewmen and wounded six others, and slightly damaging the ship's stern. The ship later patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods, losing one man overboard and three injured during a storm at the end of October. On the night of 18 19 November, Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey, in his flagship Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and Hans Lody, in laying a minefield off the Humber Estuary that claimed another seven ships of 38,710 Gross Register Tons GRT , including the Polish ocean liner M S Pisudski of 14,294 GRT. Bey, now using Hans Lody as his flagship, left port on the morning of 6 December with Z12 Erich Giese and Z11 Bernd von Arnim to lay a minefield off Cromer. The latter ship had severe boiler problems and was ordered to return to port in the late afternoon while the other two continued their mission. They spotted several darkened ships as they approached their destination, including the destroyers HMS Juno and HMS Jersey, but were not spotted in return. As the two German destroyers withdrew after having laid their mines, they spotted the two British destroyers again at a range of 8,000 meters 8,700 yd and closed to attack. When the range dropped to 4,600 meters 5,000 yd , Lody fired three torpedoes at Juno, the leading British ship, while Giese fired four at Jersey. None of Lody's torpedoes struck their target, but one of Giese's hit Jersey abreast her aft torpedo mount. The torpedo detonated in an oil fuel tank and started a major fire. Neither British ship spotted the German destroyers and they continued on while Juno turned about to help her sister. Two British ships totalling 5,286 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Hans Lody began a refit at Wesermunde on 9 December that was not finished until 22 May 1940. In June Hans Lody was tasked to escort the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper, in Operation Juno, a planned attack on Harstad, Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at Narvik. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the troop transport Orama, the oil tanker Oil Pioneer and the minesweeping trawler Juniper en route, Hans Lody delivering the coup de grace on the first two of these. The German commander, Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, then ordered the Admiral Hipper and all four destroyers to Trondheim because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. The two battleships continued the sortie and sank the aircraft carrier Glorious and her two escorting destroyers, although Scharnhorst was badly damaged by a torpedo from the destroyer Acasta in the engagement. The battleship was escorted home by Hans Lody and her sisters Steinbrinck and Z7 Hermann Schoemann for repairs. The destroyer was lightly damaged during an air raid on 13 June, but was back in service a week later. She returned to Norway in time to screen the crippled Gneisenau as she returned to Kiel on 25 July, suffering a minor collision with the battleship en route. Hans Lody transferred to France on 9 September in preparation for Operation Sealion, the planned invasion of Great Britain. Now based at Brest, the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. During a Royal Air Force air raid on Brest on 10 October, Hans Lody was slightly damaged by bomb splinters and strafing, losing two crewmen killed and seven wounded during the attack. Bey led Hans Lody and four other destroyers during a sortie for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. On the night of 2425 November, Hans Lody and the destroyers Z4 Richard Beitzen and Z20 Karl Galster sortied from Brest, bound for the Land's End area. En route they encountered some fishing ships south west of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire with little effect. The German ships then spotted a small convoy and sank one of the three merchantmen and damaged another. The flash from the guns alerted the five destroyers of the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla, but they could not intercept the German destroyers before dawn. Three nights later the German ships sortied again for the same area. They encountered two tugboats and a barge, but only sank one of the former and the barge, totaling 424 GRT. This time the 5th Destroyer Flotilla was able to intercept around 06 30 on 29 November. The Germans opened fire first, each destroyer firing four torpedoes, of which only two from Hans Lody hit their target, HMS Javelin. The torpedoes hit at each end of the ship and blew off her bow and stern, but the British were able to tow her home. Hans Lody was hit by two 2 pounder 40 mm shells during the engagement, but suffered no casualties. The ship returned home on 5 December for a refit in Wesermunde that lasted until April 1941. She was one of the escorts for the battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Cape Arkona to Trondheim on 1922 May as they sortied into the North Atlantic. The following month, Hans Lody escorted the heavy cruiser Lutzow from Kiel to Norway as the latter ship attempted to break through the British blockade. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted Lutzow and her escorts en route and one managed to surprise the ships and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z10 Hans Lody was then sent to Kirkenes, Norway, in July. Now a part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla 6. Zerstorerflottille , she participated in a sortie on 1213 July that sank two small Soviet ships at the cost of expending 80 of their ammunition. Her participation in another sortie on 22 July had to be cancelled due to condenser problems. When the British aircraft carriers Victorious and Furious attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far to the east and could not catch the British ships before they left the area. The German destroyers sortied into the Kola Inlet on 9 August where they sank one small Soviet patrol vessel. The flotilla was now assigned to escort convoys between Tromso and Kirkenes during one of these missions, the submarine Trident sank two troop carrying freighters, Bahia Laura and Donau II despite the destroyers. Hans Lody depth charged Trident without significant effect and rescued 38 survivors from the two ships. The ship departed for Germany for repairs to her boilers on 27 September. After repairs were completed, she screened Lutzow during her voyage to Trondheim 1520 May 1942 and laid a minefield in the Skaggerak en route. Hans Lody was damaged when a valve was left open and flooded the starboard engine room in early June and required two weeks to be repaired. She was one of four destroyers assigned to escort the battleship Tirpitz during Operation Rosselsprung Knight's Move , an attack on the Russia bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although three of the destroyers, including Hans Lody, assigned to Tirpitz's escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for repairs. After temporary repairs, she was towed back to Kiel for permanent repairs on 25 July. Three days later the ships were attacked without effect by three Beaufort torpedo bombers. Korvettenkapitan Karl Adolf Zenker assumed command in August. The dockyard estimated the time to repair Hans Lody at six months or more and the Kriegsmarine gave serious consideration to decommissioning her as uneconomical to repair, but was persuaded to repair her anyway. By 1943, the ship had received a FuMO 21 search radar. During sea trials on 15 February 1943, a fire broke out in an engine room repairs were not completed until 22 April and the ship then returned to Norway. In September the ship participated in Operation Zitronella, ferrying troops of the 349th Grenadier Regiment Grenadier Regiment of the 230th Infantry Division to destroy Norwegian facilities on the island of Spitzbergen, together with Tirpitz and the battleship Scharnhorst, escorted by eight other destroyers. While successful, the operation was primarily intended to boost the morale of the ships stationed in the Arctic when fuel shortages limited their activities and the Allies reestablished the bases five weeks later. Hans Lody and her sisters then spent the next six months in southern Norway laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. She was ordered to Kiel at the end of April 1944 for a lengthy refit that lasted until February 1945. Sometime in 1944, the ship had her radar replaced by a FuMO 24 search radar and her foremast was rebuilt in a goal post shape to allow the 6 by 2 meter 19.7 ft 6.6 ft antenna to fully rotate. A FuMO 63 K Hohentwiel radar replaced the searchlight on its platform abaft the rear funnel. After working up, the ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Skaggerak on 5 April. A month later, Hans Lody departed Copenhagen to load refugees at the Hela Peninsula in East Prussia she had about 1,500 aboard when she returned on 7 May. The ship sailed to Kiel the next day and was decommissioned on 9 May. The Royal Navy assumed control of her the following day and sailed her to Wilhelmshaven where she waited while the Allies decided on the disposition of the captured ships. She was allocated to Britain at the end of 1945 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 January 1946 where she was allocated the pennant number of R38, later H40. The ship was initially used to familiarize the British on her high pressure boilers until October when she was used as accommodation ship in Southampton. Hans Lody was arrived at Sunderland under tow on 17 July 1949 to be broken up.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z10%20Hans%20Lody
"Z11 Bernd von Arnim was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 the ship made one successful minelaying sortie off the English coast that claimed one British warship and seven merchant ships. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, Bernd von Arnim fought the British destroyer Glowworm while transporting troops to the Narvik area in early April 1940, but neither ship was damaged during the action. The ship fought in both naval Battles of Narvik several days later and had to be scuttled after she exhausted her ammunition. Bernd von Arnim had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 long tons 2,206 t at standard load and 3,190 long tons 3,240 t at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Bernd von Arnim carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Bernd von Arnim carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines. The ship was ordered on 4 August 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 26 March 1935 as yard number G537. She was launched on 8 July 1936 and completed on 6 July 1938. When World War II began in September 1939, Bernd von Arnim was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. The ship also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. Bernd von Arnim joined the other destroyers in laying minefields off the British coast in November, when Bernd von Arnim, Hermann Kunne and Wilhelm Heidkamp laid about 180 magnetic mines in the middle of the Thames Estuary on the night of 17 18 November. The destroyer HMS Gipsy, one trawler, and seven other ships totalling 27,565 Gross Register Tons GRT were sunk by this minefield. Four days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst through the North Sea to break out into the North Atlantic. Together with her sisters Hans Lody and Erich Giese, Bernd von Arnim was to lay a minefield off Cromer during the night of 6 7 December, but she had trouble with two of her boilers and had to shut them down. The ship was ordered to return to port while the other two destroyers continued their mission. Bernd von Arnim was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Bernd von Arnim was spotted by the British destroyer Glowworm in a storm on the morning of 8 April and the ship turned away to the north west at full speed after laying a smoke screen. The German ship was suffering damage from the heavy seas at 35 knots 65 km h 40 mph and was forced to reduce speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph after she had lost two men overboard. The British destroyer was better suited for the conditions and began to close on Bernd von Arnim. Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Curt Rechel, captain of von Arnim, turned his ship to the north east, closer to the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships exchanged fire without effect for an hour until Hipper came within range and sank Glowworm shortly afterward. The German destroyers reached the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April and Commodore Friedrich Bonte took his flagship Wilhelm Heidkamp, Bernd von Arnim and Georg Thiele down the fjord to Narvik. A heavy snowstorm allowed von Arnim and Thiele to enter the harbor without challenge and tie up at a pier. The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but the ship was spotted by the coast defense ship Norge a few minutes later. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire approximately 13 shells at 600800 meters 660870 yd range before von Arnim was able to fire seven torpedoes. Only two struck the Norwegian ship, but they detonated one or more of the ship's magazines and she immediately capsized and sank. None of the Norwegian shells hit either of the two German destroyers due to the darkness and falling snow, despite the short range. Von Arnim lowered boats to rescue the surviving Norwegian sailors and was able to pick up 96 men together with boats from the merchantmen in harbor. Von Arnim and Thiele were the first to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a southern arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but von Arnim and Thiele had also been alerted and were coming up to engage the British. The two German destroyers crossed the T of the British flotilla and were able to fire full broadsides at a range of only 4,000 meters 13,000 ft . They first engaged the British flagship, HMS Hardy, and badly damaged her. Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. Hardy was forced to beach herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to HMS Havock, the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. Havock pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed HMS Hunter in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. Thiele probably also hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by HMS Hotspur when the latter ship lost steering control. Hotspur was able to disengage, but Hunter capsized shortly afterward. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen. Von Arnim had been hit by five British shells, which had knocked out one boiler. This was repaired by the morning of 13 April and she received six torpedoes from the badly damaged destroyers. On the night of 12 April, Commander Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including Bernd von Arnim, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. The ship was able to make a torpedo attack on the British destroyers before being driven off, but her torpedoes all missed. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord , east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. Von Arnim had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the fjord. Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship. By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side. The ship's crew joined the German troops ashore and participated in the campaign until the British evacuated the area in June.

"Z12 Erich Giese was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was used in the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 the ship made one successful minelaying sortie off the English coast that claimed two merchant ships. While returning from that sortie, she torpedoed a British destroyer without being detected and continued on her way. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, Erich Giese fought in both naval Battles of Narvik in mid April 1940 and was sunk by British destroyers during the Second Battle of Narvik. Erich Giese had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 metric tons 2,137 long tons at standard and 3,190 metric tons 3,140 long tons at deep load.

The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Erich Giese carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' German Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines. The ship was ordered on 4 August 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 3 May 1935 as yard number G538. She was launched on 12 March 1937 and completed on 4 March 1939. Erich Giese was initially assigned to 8th Destroyer Division 8. Zerstorrer Division part of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla 4. Zerstorrer Flottille under the command of Commander Fregattenkapitan Brocksien. Two months later, the ship escorted into Hamburg the convoy returning the German Condor Legion from Spain. When World War II began, Erich Giese was assigned to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. The ship also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. The ship attempted to lay a minefield off the British coast on the night of 12 13 November, but had to turn back to escort her consorts, Theodor Riedel and Hermann Schoemann, back to Germany when they suffered machinery breakdowns. Eight days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst through the North Sea to break out into the North Atlantic. Led by Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey in his flagship Hans Lody, Erich Giese and Bernd von Arnim left port on the morning of 6 December to lay a minefield off Cromer. The latter ship had severe boiler problems and was ordered to return to port in the late afternoon while the other two continued their mission. They spotted several darkened ships as they approached their destination, including the destroyers HMS Juno and HMS Jersey, but were not spotted in return. As the two German destroyers withdrew after having laid their mines, they spotted the two British destroyers again at a range of 8,000 meters 8,700 yd and closed to attack. When the range dropped to 4,600 meters 5,000 yd , Lody fired three torpedoes at Juno, the leading British ship, while Giese fired four at Jersey. None of Lody's torpedoes struck their target, but one of Giese's hit Jersey abreast her aft torpedo mount. The torpedo detonated in an oil fuel tank and started a major fire. Neither British ship spotted the German destroyers and they continued on while Juno turned about to help her sister. Two British ships totalling 5,286 Gross Register Tons were sunk by this minefield. Giese was refitted at the Germaniawerft shipyard after her return on 8 December. The ship was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and sailed the next day. Giese fell behind the rest of Group 1 as the result of oil leaks, machinery breakdowns, and contaminated fuel oil. She fell further behind when Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Karl Smidt turned the ship about to recover a soldier who had been washed overboard by the high seas. Giese had little usable fuel left by this time and was forced to continue at a slower speed to conserve fuel. When the ship arrived at her destination on 9 April, she landed her troops in the Herjangsfjord a northern branch of the Ofotfjord to reinforce the other troops previously landed there in order to capture the Norwegian Army armory at Elvegardsmoen. Later in the day, Erich Giese moved to Narvik harbor, but was not able to refuel before she was ordered to return to the Herjangsfjord well before dawn together with her sisters Wolfgang Zenker and Erich Koellner. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the German 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik. Giese and Koellner were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, so Commander Bey decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1. Commander Bey was ordered during the afternoon of 10 April to return to Germany with all seaworthy ships that evening. Only Erich Giese and Wolfgang Zenker were ready for sea and they slipped out of the Ofotfjord and turned south. Visibility was good that night and they spotted the light cruiser HMS Penelope and her two escorting destroyers and Commander Bey decided to turn back even though his ships had not been spotted by the British. Three other destroyers refuelled and completed their repairs on 11 April, but Bey decided against another breakout attempt despite the fog and poor visibility that night. Bey made no attempt to break out during the night of 12 13 April, possibly because two of the destroyers had been damaged earlier in the day when they ran aground. That night he received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. Erich Giese reported that she was only capable of 28 knots 52 km h 32 mph , although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers. The battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, not including Giese, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. The ship did not have enough steam raised to participate and remained in the harbor. She attempted to leave the harbor after the British had driven off the other German ships, but her port engine seized up and left her almost dead in the water at the mouth of the harbor. While attempting to repair her engine, Giese was approached by the destroyers HMS Punjabi and HMS Bedouin which fired five torpedoes at her. All of them missed and Giese's torpedoes were equally unsuccessful. She did hit Punjabi with six or seven 12.7 cm shells which holed the ship several times just above the waterline, wrecked her fire control system, severed her main steam line and started several fires. Casualties aboard Punjabi were seven killed and 14 wounded. In the meantime, Giese had managed to repair her engine after ten minutes of work and limped forward at her maximum speed of 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph to engage the remaining British destroyers. Bedouin closed to point blank range and had her forward gun turret knocked out by Giese, but the latter was hit at least 20 times and reduced to a blazing wreck that finally sank shortly before midnight. Eighty three of her crew were killed outright during the battle, but the destroyer HMS Foxhound did rescue 11 men, although two subsequently died of their wounds. Surviving crew members later testified that they had been fired upon while drifting in the water. The ship's remaining crewmen managed to get ashore one way or another. In 2011, a 150 kilograms 330 lb bronze Reichsadler was salvaged from the wreck of Giese, in order to be displayed at the War Museum in Narvik. The ship's bell from Giese was removed by looters in the 1960s, as were the Reichsadler from the nine other German destroyers sunk at Narvik.

"Z13 Erich Koellner was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was still working up. In early 1940 she made two successful minelaying sorties off the English coast that claimed six merchant ships. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, Erich Koellner fought in both naval Battles of Narvik in mid April 1940 and was severely damaged by British ships during the Second Battle of Narvik. The ship was scuttled by her crew shortly afterwards. Erich Koellner had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 metric tons 2,137 long tons at standard and 3,190 metric tons 3,140 long tons at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Erich Koellner carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The ship's crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 sailors. Erich Koellner carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines. The ship was ordered on 10 November 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 12 October 1935 as yard number G539. She was launched on 18 March 1937 and completed on 28 August 1939. Erich Koellner was still on sea trials when World War II began and did not become operational until early January 1940 when she was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Division 8. Zerstorerdivision . Led by Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey, Erich Koellner and her sisters Bruno Heinemann, and Wolfgang Zenker laid a minefield off Cromer during the night of 11 12 January that sank three ships totalling 11,153 Gross Register Tons GRT . The same three ships laid 157 mines near the Haisborough Sands off Cromer on the night of 9 10 February. This minefield sank three ships of 11,885 GRT. During Operation Wikinger, an attempt to capture British fishing trawlers operating off the Dogger Bank on 22 February, two German destroyers hit newly laid British mines in the supposedly mine free channel and sank. Koellner lost one man overboard while attempting to rescue sailors from the two sunken ships and succeeded in rescuing 24 men. Under the command of Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, the ship was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and sailed the next day. Erich Koellner suffered storm damage en route and lost two men swept overboard. When the destroyers arrived at the Ofotfjord, west of Narvik, on the early morning of 9 April, the three ships of the 4th Flotilla, under the command of Commander Erich Bey, were ordered to land their troops in the Herjangsfjord a northern branch of the Ofotfjord in order to capture a Norwegian Army armory at Elvegardsmoen. The troops encountered little resistance, but off loading them was slow because there was only a single wooden pier available. Later in the day, Koellner moved to Narvik harbor, but was not able to refuel before she was ordered to return to the Herjangsfjord well before dawn together with her sisters Wolfgang Zenker and Erich Giese. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the German ships in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the German 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik. Giese and Koellner were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition, so Commander Bey decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1. Commander Bey was ordered during the afternoon of 10 April to return to Germany with all seaworthy ships that evening, but Koellner needed more time to refuel and make repairs. They were completed the following day and the ship was ordered to patrol the mouth of the Ofotfjord that evening for picket duty. She ran aground shortly before midnight and started to take on water through damaged hull plating. She returned to Narvik on the morning of 12 April. Koellner could not be repaired with the resources available to the Germans so she was ordered to Tarstad, inside the Ramnes Narrows at the mouth of the Ofotfjord, to act as a floating battery in case of British attack. The water at Tarstad was too shallow to use torpedoes, so they were off loaded and transferred to her sisters Bernd von Arnim and Theodor Riedel . Much of her fuel was also transferred to them and 90 men not needed were put ashore. That night he received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans by surprise. Koellner had not been able to reach Tarstad and Lieutenant Commander Fregattenkapitan Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, the ship's captain, had decided to anchor near Djupvik on the south side of the fjord instead. As the British ships approached, Koellner was spotted by the Supermarine Walrus amphibian from Warspite and the leading British destroyers were fully prepared when they came around the headland behind which Koellner was hiding. The range was so close, 2,5002,500 meters 8,2008,200 ft , that the three British ships were able to use their light automatic weapons to silence the German ship's guns and they set her on fire as well as blowing off her bow with a torpedo. The 15 inch 380 mm semi armor piercing shells from Warspite went through the ship without detonating, but visibly tilted her over each time. Thirty one crewmen were killed, and 34 wounded, but none of the British ships were even damaged. Erich Koellner was scuttled shortly afterwards by detonating a depth charge in her auxiliary machinery spaces. In the aftermath of the battle, 155 of the ship's crew, including Schulze Hinrichs, were taken prisoner by Norwegian forces. The captured crewmen were first incarcerated in Vardhus Fortress in Finnmark and later transferred to Skorpa prisoner of war camp in Troms until released after the end of the Norwegian Campaign. The wreck was raised and scrapped in 1963. Coordinates 6824N 1648E 68.400N 16.800E 68.400 16.800",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z13%20Erich%20Koellner
"Z14 Friedrich Ihn was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. The ship was named after the First World War German naval officer Friedrich Ihn. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay defensive minefields in German waters. In late 1939 and early 1940, the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 18 merchant ships and a destroyer. Ihn was under repair during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year. After a lengthy refit in Germany, she returned to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships, commerce raiders, and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months. She remained in Germany for the rest of the year after returning in July. The ship was transferred to France in early 1942 to escort the capital ships as they sailed through the English Channel to return to Germany the Channel Dash . Ihn was then transferred to Norway where she participated in several unsuccessful attacks on convoys to the Soviet Union. Afterwards she returned to Germany and remained there for the rest of the year. The ship spent most of 1943 in the northern Norway although she was mostly inactive because of fuel shortages. Ihn was ordered home for a long refit late in the year and she was sent to southern Norway upon its completion in mid 1944. The ship remained there for the rest of the war, although she made several trips to evacuate refugees from East Prussia in the last days of the war. Ihn was eventually allocated to the Soviets when the surviving warships were divided between the Allies after the war. Little is known about her service with the Soviet Navy and she was probably scrapped sometime in the 1960s. Friedrich Ihn had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,239 long tons 2,275 t at standard and 3,165 long tons 3,216 t at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Friedrich Ihn carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The ship's crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 sailors. Friedrich Ihn carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Sufficient depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of sixteen charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of sixty mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by February 1941. During the war the ship's light anti aircraft armament was augmented several times. In April 1941, improved 2 cm C 38 guns replaced the original C 30 guns and three additional guns were added. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced at some point by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably in 1942. Sometime in 194445, Z14 Friedrich Ihn received a partial Barbara anti aircraft refit where twin 2 cm mounts replaced her singles, giving her a total of eighteen 2 cm barrels. Friedrich Ihn, named after the commander of the torpedo boat S35, who was killed during the Battle of Jutland in 1916, was ordered on 19 January 1935 from Blohm Voss. She was laid down at their shipyard in Hamburg on 30 May 1935 as yard number B503, launched on 5 November 1935 and completed on 6 April 1938. The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 3rd Destroyer Division. On 2324 March 1939, Friedrich Ihn was one of the destroyers escorting Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland as the Germans occupied Memel. She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. When World War II began, Friedrich Ihn was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship was scheduled to conduct a minelaying operation off the British coast in early November, but it was cancelled when one of the other destroyers assigned to participate suffered machinery problems from contaminated fuel oil. On the night of 12 13 December, German destroyers sortied to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Commodore Kommodore Friedrich Bonte in his flagship Hermann Kunne, Friedrich Ihn, Bruno Heinemann, Richard Beitzen, and Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne, where the navigation lights were still lit. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 gross register tons GRT . The destroyers were later ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nurnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. Ihn and Steinbrinck had machinery problems en route and were forced to return to port before they reached the cruisers. Ihn and her sisters Friedrich Eckoldt and Steinbrinck sortied again on the night of 18 December, but the British had turned off the navigation lights off Orfordness and the German were forced to abandon the attempt because they could not locate themselves precisely enough to lay the minefield in the proper position. Another minefield of 170 magnetic mines was laid by Ihn, Eckolt, and her sister Steinbrinck on the night of 6 7 January 1940 off the Thames Estuary. The destroyer HMS Grenville and six merchant ships totalling 21,617 GRT were lost to this minefield as well and another ship was damaged as well. Bonte led a destroyer minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area on the night of 10 11 January with Ihn, Heidkamp, Eckoldt, Anton Schmitt, Beitzen, and Karl Galster. Ihn had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by Beitzen. This minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 tons. Ihn was under repairs during Operation Weserubung in April and did not leave the dockyard until May when she began working up as part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. The flotilla was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in early September and was attacked by Bristol Blenheim bombers of the Royal Air Force on 11 September while crossing the Baie de la Seine without result, although Ihn was near missed. Now based at Brest the flotilla laid a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Led by Kapitan zur See Erich Bey, Ihn and four other destroyers sortied for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. Ihn returned home on 7 November for a refit in Stettin. Her refit was completed in late January 1941, but she was trapped by thick ice so that she could not reach Gotenhafen to work up until mid February. Ihn returned to France in April where she was based at La Pallice. There she was primarily occupied with escorting returning commerce raiders, warships and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay to bases in France. These included the raider Thor on 22 April, the supply ship Nordland, and the fleet oiler Ermland in late May. The heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen was escorted to Brest in early June after separating from the battleship Bismarck during Operation Rheinubung. Ihn sailed from Brest on 27 July for another refit and was ineffectually attacked by British motor torpedo boats MTB off Calais that same day. The ship remained in German waters for the rest of the year after completing her refit. She was sent to Brest in February 1942 to escort the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, as well as Prinz Eugen through the English Channel back to Germany Operation Cerberus . During the voyage, Ihn twice engaged British MTBs and shot down two Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. Shortly afterwards, the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim, Norway. Heavy weather forced Ihn and two other destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation. On 6 March, the battleship Tirpitz, escorted by Ihn and three other destroyers, sortied to attack the returning Convoy QP 8 and the Russia bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast Sports Palace . That night the weather worsened and Ihn suffered some damage to her bridge and forward gun mount from high waves. The following morning, Admiral Otto Ciliax, commanding the operation, ordered the destroyers to search independently for Allied ships and they stumbled across the 2,815 GRT Soviet freighter SS Ijora, a straggler from QP 8 later that afternoon and sank her. Tirpitz rejoined them shortly afterwards and Ciliax ordered Ihn to Harstad to refuel. The destroyer rejoined the battleship in the morning and was able to shoot down one of five Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious that unsuccessfully attacked the German ships at 10 20. Two hours later both ships arrived back in port. By May, Ihn was flagship of Captain Fritz Berger of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla and she was assigned to escort Tirpitz during Operation Rosselsprung Knight's Move , the attack on the Russia bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although all three of the other destroyers assigned to Tirpitz's escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for repairs. Tirpitz, the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and Ihn arrived at Altafjord on 4 July, but they were recalled shortly after sortieing on the 5th and never engaged any Allied ships. She escorted Galster, one of the destroyers that had run aground, back to Germany on 12 July. Ihn was refitted after her arrival and remained in the Baltic Sea for the rest of the year. On 9 January 1943, together with two other destroyers, she escorted Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen as they attempted to return to Norway from Gotenhafen. The ships were spotted en route two days later by an aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the attempt was abandoned as the element of surprise was lost. Another attempt was made in March, although just with Scharnhorst, and Ihn joined her escort off Kristiansand, Norway, on 7 March. Heavy weather forced the destroyer to put into Bergen, Norway, although the battleship reached Trondheim. Ihn was transferred to Narvik, Norway at the end of April, although the shortage of fuel severely limited her activities in the Arctic. She was ordered home to refit in November, a lengthy one that lasted until June 1944. She was then stationed at Horten, Norway for the rest of the year, where she was employed on convoy escort and minelaying duties, mainly in the Skagerrak. The ship received a brief refit at Swinemunde in November that augmented her anti aircraft armament and returned to Horten where she remained until May 1945. On 5 May, Ihn sailed from Denmark to Hela where she loaded refugees that she ferried to Copenhagen the following day. She immediately turned around and returned to Hela for another load that she delivered to Glucksburg, Germany, on the 8th. She surrendered at Flensburg by the next day. The ship was moved to Wilhelmshaven over the summer under British control while the division of the surviving warships was decided among the victorious Allies. While this was being argued the ships were overhauled with a small maintenance crew aboard to preserve their value. The Allied Tripartite Commission allocated Ihn to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945. By this time she had developed some problems with her boilers and the British proposed to swap her for Theodor Reidel to avoid forcing the Soviets to wait for her to be repaired. They refused and Ihn was repaired more quickly than had been estimated with additional spare boiler parts loaded aboard for the voyage. Commissioned into the Soviet Navy as Prytky Russian , the ship served in the Baltic fleet until she was struck from the list on 22 March 1952 and sold for scrap.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z14%20Friedrich%20Ihn
"Z15 Erich Steinbrinck was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the mid 1930s. The ship was named after the First World War German naval officer Erich Steinbrinck. At the beginning of World War II on 1 September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the North Sea to lay defensive minefields. In late 1939 and 1940 the ship laid multiple offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 24 merchant ships and a destroyer. Steinbrinck was under repair for most of the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year. After a lengthy refit in Germany, she returned to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships, commerce raiders, and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months. After her refit was completed, Steinbrinck was transferred to Northern Norway in 1942 where she participated in several minor operations before she was damaged running aground and forced to return to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid 1943 where she escorted German capital ships as they moved between Norway and Germany and participated in the German attack Operation Zitronella on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle. Steinbrinck was ordered home in November to begin a lengthy refit, during which she was badly damaged by Allied bombs, and was unserviceable for the rest of the war. She was turned over to the Soviet Union after the war as war reparations and only served a few years before she was converted into a training ship and then a barracks ship before being sold for scrap in 1958. Erich Steinbrinck had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,239 long tons 2,275 t at standard and 3,165 long tons 3,216 t at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,485 kW 69,042 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Erich Steinbrinck carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The ship's crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 sailors. Erich Steinbrinck carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Sufficient depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of sixteen charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of sixty mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1940. During the war the ship's light anti aircraft armament was augmented several times. In 1941, improved 2 cm C 38 guns replaced the original C 30 guns and three additional guns were added. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced at some point by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably in 1942. Sometime in 194445, Steinbrinck received the Barbara anti aircraft refit in which all of her existing 3.7 cm and most of her 2 cm guns were replaced. She retained her Flakvierling mount and the remainder of her anti aircraft armament now consisted of seven twin 3.7 cm SK M 42 mounts and four twin 2 cm mounts on the forecastle and side of the bridge. Erich Steinbrinck, named after the commander of the torpedo boat SMS V 29 killed during the Battle of Jutland in 1916, was ordered on 19 January 1935 from Blohm Voss. She was laid down at their shipyard in Hamburg on 30 May 1935 as yard number B504, launched on 24 September 1936 and completed on 31 May 1938. She was commissioned under the command of Korvettenkapitan Rolf Johannesson, later promoted to Fregattenkapitan, who commanded her until January 1942. The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 3rd Destroyer Division. She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May 1939. When World War II began, Erich Steinbrinck was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. On the night of 18 19 November, Steinbrinck was commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey's flagship for an offensive minelaying mission off the British coast when she led her sister ships Friedrich Eckoldt and Hans Lody to the Humber Estuary that claimed seven ships of 38,710 gross register tons GRT , including the Polish ocean liner M S Pisudski. On the night of 12 13 December, German destroyers sortied to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Commodore Kommodore Friedrich Bonte in his flagship Hermann Kunne, Steinbrinck, Bruno Heinemann, Richard Beitzen, and Friedrich Ihn laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne, where the navigation lights were still lit. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 GRT. The destroyers were later ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nurnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. Ihn and Steinbrinck had machinery problems en route and were forced to return to port before they reached the cruisers. Steinbrinck and her sisters Friedrich Eckoldt and Ihn sortied again on the night of 18 December, but the British had turned off the navigation lights off Orfordness and the German were forced to abandon the attempt because they could not locate themselves precisely enough to lay the minefield in the proper position. Another minefield of 170 magnetic mines was laid by Steinbrinck, Ihn and Eckoldt on the night of 67 January 1940 off the Thames Estuary. The destroyer HMS Grenville and six merchant ships totalling 21,617 GRT were lost to this minefield as well and another ship was damaged as well. The ship was under repairs during Operation Weserubung in April and did not leave the dockyard until May when she began working up as part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. Her work up was cut short to escort the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper participating in Operation Juno, a planned attack on Harstad, Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at Narvik. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the troop transport Orama, the oil tanker Oil Pioneer and the minesweeping trawler Juniper en route. The German commander, Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, then ordered the Admiral Hipper and all four destroyers to Trondheim because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. The two battleships continued the sortie and sank the aircraft carrier Glorious and her two escorting destroyers, although Scharnhorst was badly damaged by a torpedo from the destroyer Acasta in the engagement. The battleship was escorted home by the destroyers Steinbrinck, Lody and Hermann Schoemann for repairs. Steinbrinck and Lody then returned to Trondheim to escort Gneisenau home, after she been torpedoed by a British submarine. The flotilla laid defensive minefields in the North Sea in August and early September before it was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid September. Now based at Brest the flotilla laid a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Led by captain Kapitan zur See Erich Bey, Steinbrinck and four other destroyers sortied for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. Steinbrinck returned home on 7 November for a refit in Stettin. Her refit was completed in late January 1941, but she was trapped by thick ice so that she could not reach Gotenhafen to work up until mid February. Steinbrinck returned to France in April where she was based at La Pallice. There she was primarily occupied with escorting returning commerce raiders, warships and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay to bases in France. These included the raider Thor on 22 April, the supply ship Nordland, and the fleet oiler Ermland in late May. The heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen was escorted to Brest in early June after separating from the battleship Bismarck during Operation Rheinubung. By the late summer, Steinbrinck was well overdue for a refit and was suffering from boiler problems but her refit was postponed to allow her to escort the raider Orion on 21 August. Her departure was delayed when she ran aground at the beginning of the next month and she did not depart for Germany until 6 September. Sometime in 1941, the destroyer received a FuMO 21 search radar that was mounted above her bridge. Steinbrinck only briefly operated in northern Norway where she participated in Operation Wunderland in August, where she and her sisters Eckoldt and Beitzen escorted the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer at the beginning and end of its mission to attack Soviet shipping in the Kara Sea. They also escorted the minelayer Ulm as it departed to lay a minefield off Cape Zhelaniya in mid August. Steinbrinck ran aground at the beginning of September and was sent home after temporary repairs were made at Trondheim. The ship returned to Norway in January 1943 where she was slightly damaged by a practice torpedo fired by the submarine U 703. In early March she escorted Scharnhorst through the Skaggerak to Trondheim in heavy weather that washed two men overboard. By mid month, Steinbrinck was the flagship of Captain Kapitan zur See , commander of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. In September the ship participated in Operation Zitronella, ferrying troops of the 349th Grenadier Regiment to destroy Norwegian facilities on the island of Spitzbergen, together with the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, escorted by eight other destroyers. After unloading her troops, she bombarded targets on the island until her fire main broke from the shock of shooting and partially flooded one of her compartments. While successful, the operation was primarily intended to boost the morale of the ships stationed in the Arctic when fuel shortages limited their activities and the Allies reestablished the bases five weeks later. Steinbrinck and two other destroyers escorted the pocket battleship Lutzow back to Germany in September and returned to Narvik. On 25 November she was ordered to return to Germany for an overhaul, but accidentally collided with a small Norwegian steamer en route later that night. The collision severely damaged her bow and she had to sail slowly to Trondheim for emergency repairs lest the forward bulkhead collapse. The ship then received temporary repairs in Oslo before departing for Germany on 18 December. After her refit was completed on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck and her sister Theodor Riedel spent the first half of the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. Sometime in 1944, the ship had her radar replaced by a FuMO 24 search radar and her foremast was rebuilt in a goal post shape to allow the 6 by 2 meter 19.7 ft 6.6 ft antenna to fully rotate. A FuMO 63 K Hohentwiel radar replaced the searchlight on its platform abaft the rear funnel. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the diesel generator room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermunde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered. The ship was moved to Wilhelmshaven over the summer under British control while the division of the surviving warships was decided among the victorious Allies. While this was being argued the ships were overhauled with a small maintenance crew aboard to preserve their value. The Allied Tripartite Commission allocated Steinbrinck to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and she sailed for Libau on 2 January 1946. She was commissioned into the Soviet Navy under the name Pylky Russian and assigned to the Soviet 4th Fleet, based at Rostock, through 1948. Renamed PK3 2, she served as a barracks ship until 19 February 1958, when she was struck from the list. On 18 April 1958, she was sold for scrap and broken up afterwards.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z15%20Erich%20Steinbrinck
"Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt was a Type 1934A class destroyer built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s. It was named after Kapitanleutnant Friedrich Eckoldt 18871916 , the commander of torpedo boat V 48, who was killed when his boat was sunk during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 and 1940 the ship made multiple successful minelaying sorties off the English coast that claimed 21 merchant ships. Eckoldt participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940. The ship was transferred to France later in the year. Eckoldt returned to Germany in late 1940 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June 1941 as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The ship spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti shipping patrols in Soviet waters, but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year. Eckoldt escorted several German heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of their anti shipping raids in 1942. She was part of a German surface fleet which attacked Convoy JW 51B on 31 December near the North Cape, Norway. After sinking the minesweeper HMS Bramble, Eckoldt mistook the British light cruiser HMS Sheffield for the German heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper and was taken completely by surprise when the cruiser opened fire. The ship sank with all hands without returning fire. Friedrich Eckoldt had an overall length of 119 meters 390 ft 5 in and was 114 meters 374 ft 0 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.30 meters 37 ft 1 in , and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters 13 ft 11 in . She displaced 2,171 metric tons 2,137 long tons at standard and 3,190 metric tons 3,140 long tons at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp which would propel the ship at 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Friedrich Eckoldt carried a maximum of 752 metric tons 740 long tons of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles 8,100 km 5,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , but the ship proved top heavy in service and 30 of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi 2,830 km 1,760 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The ship's crew consisted of 10 officers and 315 sailors. Friedrich Eckoldt carried five 12.7 cm SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Sufficient depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of sixteen charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of sixty mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. The ship was ordered on 19 January 1935 and laid down at Blohm Voss, Hamburg on 4 November 1935 as yard number B505. She was launched on 21 March 1937 and completed on 28 July 1938. The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 3rd Destroyer Division. On 2324 March 1939, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt was one of the destroyers escorting Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel. She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. When World War II began, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. On the night of 17 18 October, Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led Eckoldt, Z19 Hermann Kunne, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . On the night of 18 19 November, Eckoldt and Hans Lody, led by Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey in his flagship Erich Steinbrinck, laid another minefield off the Humber Estuary that claimed another seven ships of 38,710 GRT, including the Polish ocean liner M S Pisudski of 14,294 GRT. Another minefield of 170 magnetic mines was laid by Eckoldt, Ihn and Steinbrinck on the night of 6 7 January 1940 off the Thames Estuary. The destroyer HMS Grenville and six merchant ships totalling 21,617 GRT were lost to this minefield as well and another ship was damaged as well. Commodore Friedrich Bonte led a minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area with Heidkamp, Eckoldt, Anton Schmitt, Richard Beitzen, Galster, and Ihn. The latter ship suffered tube failures in her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by Beitzen. This minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 tons. Eckoldt, Beitzen and Max Schultz laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area, off Harwich, on 9 10 February that sank six ships of 28,496 GRT and damaged another. Eckoldt was the flagship during Operation Wikinger, an attempt to capture British fishing trawlers operating off the Dogger Bank on 22 February, when two destroyers sank with heavy loss of life one hit newly laid British mines in a supposedly mine free channel and the other was bombed in error by the Luftwaffe. Friedrich Eckoldt was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung. The group's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment 138. Gebirgsjager Regiment to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldt's port propeller shaft began to overheat shortly after passing the mouth of the Elbe River and she had to slow down. The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hipper's speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later. After completing her refit in early September the ship may have been fitted with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge at this time , Eckoldt was transferred to France with four of the surviving destroyers on 9 September. The ship covered five other destroyers laying mines in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totalling only 2026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Eckoldt was attacked by Fairey Swordfish of No. 812 Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm during the night of 9 10 October and lightly damaged by bomb splinters. One man was killed and three were wounded. The ship was transferred back to Hamburg on 5 November where she was refitted until the end of December. Eckoldt was training in the Baltic until she escorted the battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Cape Arkona to Trondheim on 1922 May as they sortied into the North Atlantic. The following month, she escorted the pocket battleship Lutzow from Kiel to Norway as the latter ship attempted to break through the British blockade. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted Lutzow and her escorts and one managed to surprise the ships and torpedo the pocket battleship early on the morning of 13 June. Eckoldt took Lutzow under tow until the latter managed to restart her starboard engine and proceed under her own power. On 20 June, Eckoldt sailed for Bergen, Norway, with Galster and Schonemann where they waited until 4 July for the latter's main feed pump to be repaired and for Beitzen and Lody to arrive. All five destroyers arrived at Kirkenes on 10 July. They mounted their first anti shipping patrol on 12 July, but did not spot anything until the following night. A small Soviet convoy was spotted and two of its ships were sunk after expending four fifths of their ammunition. As the German ships were returning to port, they were attacked by several aircraft, of which Eckoldt claimed to have shot down one. A second patrol was made on 22 July, but only a single Soviet ship was sunk while the German ships were not damaged by several aerial attacks. When the British aircraft carriers Victorious and Furious attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far to the east and could not catch the British ships before they left the area. The German destroyers made one final sortie into the Kola Inlet where they sank one small Soviet patrol vessel. Eckoldt was damaged by a single aircraft's bombs that straddled the ship and damaged her steering and starboard engine. This damage was temporarily repaired, but Eckoldt was ordered to Narvik for more thorough repairs. After they were completed, the ship remained in the Arctic for convoy escort duties. She was accidentally rammed by a Norwegian freighter in Troms on 12 October and was given temporary repairs in the floating dock at Trondheim on 22 October before she was sent to Kiel for more permanent repairs where she arrived on 9 November. Eckoldt finished her repairs and overhaul on 15 April 1942 and was training until she attempted to sail for Norway on 11 June. She developed more engine problems en route and had to turn back for repairs. The ship reached Trondheim on 9 July, escorting the light cruiser Koln both ships laid mines at the entrance to the Skagerrak en route. Eckoldt continued onwards and reached Narvik on 18 July. During Operation Wunderland in August, Eckoldt, Beitzen and Steinbrinck escorted the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer at the beginning and end of its mission to attack Soviet shipping in the Kara Sea. They also escorted the minelayer Ulm as it departed to lay a minefield off Cape Zhelaniya in mid August. On 1315 October, Eckoldt, Beitzen, and the destroyers Z27 and Z30 laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea that sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November. During Operation Regenbogen, the attempt to intercept Convoy JW 51B sailing from the UK to the Soviet Union in late December, Eckoldt, Beitzen, and Z29 escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to occupy the attention of the convoy's escort while Lutzow and three other destroyers attacked the convoy. The three destroyers separated from Hipper to search for the convoy and were successful on the morning of 31 December. The destroyer HMS Obdurate spotted them in turn and closed to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a range of 8,000 meters 8,700 yd . Obdurate turned away to rejoin the convoy without sustaining any damage and the German ships did not pursue as they had been ordered to rejoin Hipper. The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble, which had been detached earlier from the convoy to search for stragglers, as they maneuvered to close with the convoy and the destroyers were ordered to sink her while Hipper engaged the convoy's escorting destroyers. This took some time in the poor visibility and Hipper was surprised in the meantime by the British covering force of the light cruisers Sheffield and Jamaica. After sinking Bramble, the German destroyers Beitzen and Eckoldt attempted to rejoin Hipper, ignorant that British cruisers were in the area. They confused Sheffield with Hipper when they spotted each other at 4,000 meters 4,400 yd range and were taken by surprise when Sheffield opened fire on the nearest, Eckoldt, with every gun she had. Eckholdt broke in two and sank with all hands in less than two minutes Beitzen escaped unscathed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z16%20Friedrich%20Eckoldt
"Z17 Diether von Roeder was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed in 1938, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. At the beginning of World War II in September, the ship was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939, the ship helped to laid an offensive minefield off the English coast that claimed seven merchant ships. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Z17 Diether von Roeder was tasked to attack Narvik and participated in both the First and Second Naval Battles of Narvik. She was crippled by British destroyers during the first battle, but was able to severely damage a British destroyer during the second battle, before she had to be scuttled to prevent her capture. Diether von Roeder had an overall length of 123.4 meters 404 ft 10 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.8 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.5 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers. Z17 Diether von Roeder had a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but she reached 41.45 knots 76.8 km h 47.7 mph from 72,500 PS 53,300 kW 71,500 shp during her sea trials. The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. Z17 Diether von Roeder was named after Lieutenant Kapitanleutnant Diether von Roeder who commanded the 13th Torpedo Boat Half Flotilla in World War I and was killed in action on 11 June 1918. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W919 on 9 September, launched on 19 August 1937, and commissioned on 29 August 1938. From 23 to 24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the heavy cruiser Deutschland to occupy Memel. She participated in the fleet exercise the next month in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May. In July, Z17 Diether von Roeder joined her sisters Z18 Hans Ludemann and Z19 Hermann Kunne making port visits in Norway. When World War II began in September, she was initially deployed in the German Bight where she laid defensive minefields. The ship then patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. On the night of 17 18 October, Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . Z17 Diether von Roeder was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. When they arrived off the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April, the ship remained at the mouth of the fjord while the other destroyers continued into the fjord to land their troops she was tasked to serve as a picket ship to warn of any British attempt to interfere with the landings. Z17 Diether von Roeder was relieved later in the day to land her troops, but resumed her task the following night. Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Erich Holtorf, the ship's captain, believed that his orders ended at dawn and returned to Narvik harbor. Unbeknownst to the Germans, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero were not far behind him, invisible in the dark and snow. They torpedoed two German destroyers and badly damaged two others while Z17 Diether von Roeder fired all of her torpedoes blindly at the harbor entrance and attempted to engage the British ships with her guns despite the driving snow. All of the torpedoes missed, possibly because their depth controls were set too deep, and her gunfire was ineffective. Visibility cleared as the leading British ships finished their attack on the harbor and several of them engaged Z17 Diether von Roeder. She was hit by at least five 4.7 inch 120 mm shells that destroyed No. 3 gun, severed the controls to the rudder, damaged the center and aft boiler rooms, knocking out all power, and set an oil tank on fire. The British shells killed nine of the ship's crew most of the survivors were used to help secure the town of Narvik. Z17 Diether von Roeder's radios were taken ashore and used to improve communications with other German commands within Norway. Over the next several days, the ship's damage was evaluated and the Germans estimated that it would take at least a week to make her mobile again. In the meantime, her light weapons were off loaded and her stern was tied to the pier in the harbor with her bow angled outwards. This meant that only her two forward guns could bear on targets. On the night of 12 13 April, Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. When the British destroyers Punjabi and Bedouin appeared at the harbor mouth, engaging Z12 Erich Giese, the 25 gunners left on board opened fire on whatever British ships were visible, including Warspite. One of the Z17 Diether von Roeder's shells hit the battleship's bridge, but only caused minor damage. The British initially thought that they were fired upon by coastal artillery in the smoke and confusion, but a report from a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber from Warspite revealed the German ship. The destroyer Cossack moved through the sunken freighters to investigate and opened fire at 2,500 meters 2,700 yd . She started making hits with her second salvo and set the German ship's stern aflame, but Z17 Diether von Roeder's return fire was devastating. The British destroyer was hit at least seven times that severed the steam pipe to the forward boiler room, damaged the center boiler room, started a fire, and knocked out her steering gear, causing her to ran aground. The German shells killed 9 men and wounded 21. The destroyer Kimberley and Warspite returned fire, the latter even hitting Z17 Diether von Roeder once, but the gunners had abandoned ship once their ammunition was exhausted and only the three man demolition party was still aboard when the destroyer Foxhound approached. They lit the fuses and ran ashore the depth charges packed into her interior exploded when the British ship was less than 50 meters 55 yd away with a boarding party ready.

"Z18 Hans Ludemann was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed in 1938, the ship spent most of her time training. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, she was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939, Z18 Hans Ludemann helped to laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed one destroyer and twenty merchant ships. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Z17 Diether von Roeder was tasked to attack Narvik and participated in both the First and Second Naval Battles of Narvik. She was damaged by British destroyers during the first battle and was one of the last surviving German destroyers during the second battle. After the British knocked out all of her guns, the ship was run ashore to allow the crew to abandon ship. They attempted to scuttle Z18 Hans Ludemann with explosives to prevent her capture, but something went wrong and the British were able to board her. A British destroyer torpedoed her wreck to prevent any repairs. Z18 Hans Ludemann had an overall length of 123.4 meters 404 ft 10 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.8 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.5 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . During Z18 Hans Ludemann's sea trials on 9 January 1940, she reached 39.8 knots 73.7 km h 45.8 mph from 74,500 PS 54,800 kW 73,500 shp . The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. Z18 Hans Ludemann was named after Engineer Midshipman Hans Ludemann who saved the lives of the remaining men in the engine room in the torpedo boat S 13 after the high pressure cylinder exploded on 14 May 1913. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W920 on 9 September, launched on 1 December 1937, and commissioned on 8 October 1938. In July 1939, Z18 Hans Ludemann joined her sisters Z17 Diether von Roeder and Z19 Hermann Kunne making port visits in Norway. When World War II began in September, she was initially deployed in the German Bight where she laid defensive minefields. The ship then patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. On the night of 17 18 October, Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . On the night of 12 13 November Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, now the flagship of the Commander of Destroyers Fuhrer der Zerstorer , Kapitan zur See Captain Friedrich Bonte, escorted Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid 288 magnetic mines in the Thames estuary. Once again unaware of the minefield's existence, the British lost the destroyer Blanche and thirteen merchant ships displacing 48,728 GRT. On 1 December she began a refit at Stettin that lasted for three months. Z18 Hans Ludemann was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. When they arrived off the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April, Z18 Hans Ludemann and Z22 Anton Schmitt landed their troops at the Ramnes narrows to search for the coastal artillery positions that the Germans mistakenly believed to command the mouth of the fjord. Z17 Diether von Roeder remained offshore to provide support if necessary and to serve as a picket ship in case the British intended to interfere with the operation. About 11 00 the troops were ordered to reboard their destroyers which proceeded to Narvik. Shortly after midnight, Z18 Hans Ludemann was ordered to start fuelling from the whale factory ship SS Jan Wellem. Shortly after dawn on 10 April, the ship was still tied up to Jan Wellem when the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero appeared. As soon as the German destroyer maneuvered clear of the tanker, she fired at Havock, without scoring any hits in the dark and snow. The British ship returned fire, disabling one of Z18 Hans Ludemann's forward guns, severing the rudder controls, and started a fire that caused one of the magazines to be flooded. At 05 15 the ship radioed to the other destroyers anchored in the Herjangsfjord and near Ballangen. Fifteen minutes later, the British decided to attack Narvik again and her crew had managed to make some repairs in the meantime. The ship fired four torpedoes at the attacking British ship, but missed with all of them, possibly because their depth controls were set too deep. She hit Hostile once with a 12.7 cm shell during the second attack, but inflicted only minor damage. Z18 Hans Ludemann completed temporary repairs and was operational by 11 April. On the night of 12 13 April, Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. Z19 Hermann Kunne, leading Z13 Erich Koellner westwards to take up her position flanking the entrance to the fjord, was the first ship to spot the approaching British ships and alerted Bey. The five operable destroyers, including Z18 Hans Ludemann, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships at long range from behind a smoke screen. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord , east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush any pursuing British destroyers. Z18 Hans Ludemann still had some ammunition and torpedoes left and took up position at the Straumen narrows with Z2 Georg Thiele to give the two remaining destroyers time to scuttle themselves at the head of the fjord. The pursuing British destroyers initially engaged Z18 Hans Ludemann, which had opened fire at a range of about 3 miles 4,800 m to little effect. Her four remaining torpedoes were fired blindly, one of which was observed to pass under Forester, and all missed. Shortly afterwards Eskimo hit the German destroyer twice, destroying No. 4 and No. 5 guns and damaging No. 3 gun, the only ones that could bear on the British ships. Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Herbert Friedrichs, captain of the ship, decided to withdraw as she could no longer fight the British ships and beached the ship at the head of the fjord. He ordered her rigged for demolition and abandoned ship while Z2 Georg Thiele continued to fight. Several hours later, after the latter ship was destroyed, the destroyers Hero and Icarus approached and found Z18 Hans Ludemann still intact, the demolition charges having failed. The former sent a boarding party aboard, but they found nothing but souvenirs and Hero, following her orders to destroy all of the German destroyers, torpedoed her wreck.

"Z19 Hermann Kunne was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed at the beginning of 1939, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel a few months later. At the beginning of World War II in September, she was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939, Z18 Hans Ludemann helped to laid four offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed two British destroyers and thirty eight merchant ships. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, she was tasked to attack Narvik and participated in both the First and Second Naval Battles of Narvik. Z19 Hermann Kunne was disabled during the first battle, but was repaired in time to fight in the second battle until she had exhausted her ammunition. Afterwards the ship had to be scuttled to prevent her capture. Z19 Hermann Kunne had an overall length of 125.1 meters 410 ft 5 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.8 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.5 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . During Z19 Hermann Kunne's sea trials on 2122 March 1939, she reached 39 knots 72.2 km h 44.9 mph from 72,100 PS 53,000 kW 71,100 shp . The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. Z19 Hermann Kunne was named after a gunner aboard the torpedo boat S 53 was killed in hand to hand combat during the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W921 on 5 October, launched on 22 December 1937, and commissioned on 12 January 1939. From 23 to 24 March, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the heavy cruiser Deutschland to occupy Memel. On 30 June, Z19 Hermann Kunne and her sister Z18 Hans Ludemann were making port visits in Norway when the former accidentally rammed the pier at Moldefjord after her rudder failed. She returned to Swinemunde on 20 July and participated in torpedo training the following month. When World War II began in September, Z19 Hermann Kunne was initially deployed in the German Bight where she laid defensive minefields. The ship then patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. On the night of 17 18 October, Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . Missions on the nights of 8 9 and 10 11 November had to be aborted because of seawater contamination in Z19 Hermann Kunne's fuel. On the night of 12 13 November Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, now the flagship of the Commander of Destroyers Fuhrer der Zerstorer , Kapitan zur See Captain Friedrich Bonte, escorted Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid 288 magnetic mines in the Thames estuary. Once again unaware of the minefield's existence, the British lost the destroyer Blanche and thirteen merchant ships of 48,728 GRT. Less than a week later, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z11 Bernd von Arnim laid 180 magnetic mines in the Thames Estuary on the night of 17 18 November. The mines sank the destroyer Gipsy, a fishing trawler, and seven ships of 27,565 GRT. On the night of 12 13 December, German destroyers sortied to lay minefields off the British coast. Under the command of Commodore Kommodore Bonte in his flagship Z19 Hermann Kunne, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z8 Bruno Heinemann, Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne, where the navigation lights were still lit. The British lost eleven ships totaling 18,979 GRT. En route home, the destroyers were ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nurnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers' withdrawal. Z19 Hermann Kunne was scheduled for another minelaying mission on 17 December, but boiler contamination prevented her participation and she was refitting in Stettin until 14 March 1940 Z19 Hermann Kunne was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. When they arrived off the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April, Z19 Hermann Kunne landed her troops at the head of the Herjangsfjord and helped to capture the Norwegian Army barracks at Elvegardsmoen. Later that day she briefly refuelled from the whale factory ship SS Jan Wellem and then stood picket duty until midnight when she returned to Jan Wellem to top off her fuel tanks. Shortly after dawn on 10 April, the ship was still tied up to Jan Wellem when the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero appeared. Hardy, Hunter and Havock made the first attack on Narvik harbor while the other two acted as rearguards. Z19 Hermann Kunne exchanged fire with Hunter to no effect while preparing to back away from the whaler. By the time Havock opened fire, the German ship was underway, having cast off hoses and mooring lines. When the British destroyer hit and sank Z22 Anton Schmitt with a torpedo, Z19 Hermann Kunne was only 40 meters 44 yd away and the shock from the detonation knocked out her turbines. Without power, the ship drifted into the wreck and became entangled with it. Some of her crew panicked and jumped overboard, but only a few were rescued. After about an hour, she was able to restore power and disentangle herself from Z22 Anton Schmitt's wreck. Z19 Hermann Kunne had suffered from splinter damage that killed nine crewmen. Later that afternoon she sailed to the wreck of Hardy where it had ran aground and searched it. On the night of 12 13 April, Commander Fregattenkapitan Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. Z19 Hermann Kunne, leading Z13 Erich Koellner westwards to take up her position flanking the entrance to the fjord, was the first ship to spot the approaching British ships and alerted Bey. The other operable destroyers joined Z19 Hermann Kunne as she fell back and engaged the British ships at long range from behind a smoke screen. Nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers attacked the German destroyers, near missing Z19 Hermann Kunne and another ship, but lost two aircraft shot down during the attack. By the early afternoon, the Germans had exhausted most of their ammunition and Bey ordered his ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord , east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush any pursuing British destroyers. Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Friedrich Kothe, captain of the ship, misunderstood the signal and headed north into the Herjangsfjord where he ran the ship aground in Trollvika near Bjerkvik. She had fired off all of her ammunition, including practice and star shells her depth charges were rigged for demolition and they were set off once the crew had abandoned ship. The destroyers Eskimo and Forester followed the German ship into the Herjangsfjord and the former put a torpedo into the wreck for good measure, breaking off her stern. The ship was partially scrapped and the remains further demolished after World War II. It rests on its starboard side between 0 m 0 ft and 37 m 121 ft depth. In a 1999 survey, the wreck was found to contain no remaining oil . The wreck location is relatively easy to access, and wreck diving is permitted.

"Z20 Karl Galster was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed in early 1939, the ship spent most of her time training. At the beginning of World War II in September, she was initially deployed to lay minefields off the German coast, but was soon transferred to the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939 and early 1940, Z20 Karl Galster helped to laid three offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed one British destroyer, a fishing trawler, and twenty merchant ships. After a refit that prevented her from participating in the German invasion of Norway in April, the ship was sent to Norway for escort duties. Later that year Z20 Karl Galster was transferred to France, where she made several attacks on British shipping. The ship returned to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Z20 Karl Galster spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti shipping patrols in Soviet waters but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year until engine problems sent her back to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid 1942, but was badly damaged when she ran aground in July and did not return until December. Z20 Karl Galster participated in the German attack Operation Zitronella on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle, in September 1943. Plagued by engine problems, the ship was under repair from November to August 1944 and then spent the next six months on convoy escort duties in southern Norway when not laying minefields. Around March 1945, Z20 Karl Galster was transferred to the Baltic Sea where she helped to escort convoys of refugee ships and also rescued evacuees herself in May, around the time that Germany surrendered. When the surviving German warships were divided between the Allies after the war, the ship was eventually allocated to the Soviet Union. Z20 Karl Galster was handed over in 1946 and renamed Prochnyy. The ship was converted into a training ship in 1950 and then became an accommodation ship in 1954. She was scrapped four years later. Z20 Karl Galster had an overall length of 125.10 meters 410 ft 5 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.8 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.5 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . During Z20 Karl Galster's sea trials on 16May 1939, she reached 39 knots 72.2 km h 44.9 mph from 76,500 PS 56,300 kW 75,500 shp . The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. In 1942, the ship had a FuMO 24 25 radar installed above the bridge as well as two FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radars, one of which replaced the aft searchlight. A FuMB 1 Metox radar detector was also installed that year. The details of the changes made to her anti aircraft suite are not well documented, but photographic evidence shows that a quadruple 2 cm mount had been added by early 1944. Before the end of the war, the ship had her midships 2 cm guns replaced by a pair of 3.7 cm Flak M42 gun in single mounts and that four twin 2 cm mounts had probably been added in the forward superstructure. Z20 Karl Galster was named after Kapitanleutnant Lieutenant Karl Galster who commanded the torpedo boat S 22 and was killed in action on 21 March 1916. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W922 on 14 September 1937, launched on 15 June 1938, and commissioned on 21 March 1939. She visited Andalsnes, Norway, in July and then participated in a torpedo training exercise the following month. When World War II began in September, Z20 Karl Galster was initially deployed in the German Bight where she laid defensive minefields. The ship then patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. On the night of 17 18 October, Konteradmiral Rear Admiral Gunther Lutjens, aboard his flagship Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . Missions on the nights of 8 9 and 10 11 November had to be aborted because of seawater contamination in Z19 Hermann Kunne's fuel. On the night of 12 13 November Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, now the flagship of the Fuhrer der Zerstorer FdZ Commander of Destroyers , Kapitan zur See KzS Captain Friedrich Bonte, escorted Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid 288 magnetic mines in the Thames estuary. Once again unaware of the minefield's existence, the British lost the destroyer Blanche and thirteen merchant ships of 48,728 GRT. The ship spent the rest of the year patrolling in the German Bight. Bonte and Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp led a minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area together with Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z20 Karl Galster, and Z22 Anton Schmitt on the night of 10 11 January 1940. The destroyers Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z4 Richard Beitzen were also supposed to participate, but the former had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by the latter ship. The minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 GRT. In retaliation for the Altmark Incident where the Royal Navy seized captured British sailors from the German tanker Altmark in neutral Norwegian waters on 16 February, the Kriegsmarine organized Operation Nordmark to search for Allied merchant ships in the North Sea as far north as the Shetland Islands. Z20 Karl Galster and Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp escorted the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau as well as the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper during the sortie on 18 February. Upon her return Z20 Karl Galster began a refit that lasted until 27 May. After the catastrophic destroyer losses in the Battles of Narvik in April, the Kriegsmarine reorganized its surviving destroyers and Z20 Karl Galster became the flagship of the FdZ. In June the ship was tasked to lead the escort force for Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Admiral Hipper during Operation Juno, a planned attack on Harstad, Norway, to relieve pressure on the German garrison at Narvik. The ships sortied on 8 June and sank the troop transport Orama, the oil tanker Oil Pioneer and the minesweeping trawler Juniper en route, Z20 Karl Galster assisting in the rescue of Orama's survivors. The German commander, Admiral Wilhelm Marschall, then ordered Admiral Hipper and all four destroyers to Trondheim because of the heavy weather, where they arrived in the morning of 9 June. Z20 Karl Galster remained there until she had to help screen the crippled Gneisenau as she returned to Kiel on 25 July. After a brief refit, the ship helped to lay minefields in the North Sea between 14 August and 7 September. Z20 Karl Galster, now the flagship of KzS Fritz Berger, commander of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla 5. Zerstorerflotille , transferred to France on 9 September in preparation for Operation Sealion, the planned invasion of Great Britain. Now based at Brest, the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 29 September. Five ships totaling only 2,037 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Aboard his flagship Z10 Hans Lody, the Fuhrer der Torpedoboote Commander of Torpedo Boats , KzS Erich Bey, led Z20 Karl Galster and three other destroyers during a sortie for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. On the night of 2425 November, Z20 Karl Galster, no longer Berger's flagship, Z4 Richard Beitzen and Z10 Hans Lody sortied from Brest, bound for the Land's End area. En route they encountered some fishing ships south west of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire with little effect. The German ships then spotted a small convoy and Z20 Karl Galster sank one of the three merchantmen and damaged another. The flash from the guns alerted the five destroyers of the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla, but they could not intercept the German destroyers before dawn. Three nights later the German ships sortied again for the same area. They encountered two tugboats and a barge, but only sank one of the former and the barge, totaling 424 GRT. This time the 5th Destroyer Flotilla was able to intercept around 06 30 on 29 November. The Germans opened fire first, each destroyer firing four torpedoes, of which only two from Z10 Hans Lody hit their target, the destroyer HMS Javelin. The torpedoes hit at each end of the ship and blew off her bow and stern, but the British were able to tow her home. Z20 Karl Galster returned home on 5 December for a turbine overhaul in Wesermunde that lasted until 9 June 1941. Two days later, the ship was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser Lutzow from Kiel to Norway as the latter ship attempted to break through the British blockade. Several Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers spotted Lutzow and her escorts en route and one managed to surprise the ships and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z20 Karl Galster was then sent to Kirkenes, Norway, arriving on 11 July. Now a part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla 6. Zerstorerflottille , she participated in a sortie on 1213 July that sank two small Soviet ships at the cost of expending 80 of their ammunition. Another sortie on 22 July saw Z20 Karl Galster temporarily serve as the flagship for KzS Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, commander of the 6. Zerstorerflottille, when his usual flagship Z10 Hans Lody had condenser problems. The destroyers sank a small survey ship and a flying boat and they were repeatedly attacked by Soviet aircraft to no effect before their return on the 24th. When the British aircraft carriers Victorious and Furious attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far to the east and could not catch the British ships before they left the area. Z20 Karl Galster was now assigned to escort convoys between Tromso and Kirkenes during one of these missions, the submarine Trident sank two troop carrying freighters, Bahia Laura and Donau II despite the destroyers. Z20 Karl Galster rescued over 500 survivors from the two ships. When Z10 Hans Lody required a refit in late September, Schulze Hinrichs transferred his flag to Z20 Karl Galster until she had engine problems of her own and sailed for Germany on 23 November to begin a refit that lasted until 5 May 1942. The ship, now flagship of KzS Gottfried Ponitz, commander of the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla , sailed for Trondheim on 11 June. She was one of four destroyers assigned to escort the battleship Tirpitz during Operation Rosselsprung Knight's Move , an attack on the Russia bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although three of the destroyers, including Z20 Karl Galster, assigned to Tirpitz's escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for emergency repairs. The destroyer had damaged her port turbine and buckled the port propeller shaft. Escorted by two other destroyers, Z20 Karl Galster sailed for Kiel on 12 July, steaming only on one turbine. Permanent repairs were finished by mid November, but the ship was working up until 8 December when she was one of the escorts for Lutzow's voyage to Norway, although storm damage en route forced the destroyer to put into Trondheim for repairs that lasted until 9 January 1943. Boiler damage put her back into the dockyard there until 27 February. On 11 March Z20 Karl Galster screened Tirpitz en route to Bogen Bay, and continued onward to Altafjord with Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and Lutzow. Several weeks later, Z20 Karl Galster, and the destroyers Z5 Paul Jacobi and Z6 Theodor Riedel, sailed for Jan Mayen island on 31 March to rendezvous with the blockade runner, MV Regensburg. They searched for several days before increasingly heavy weather forced them to return to port with storm damage. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Regensburg had been intercepted and sunk by a British cruiser on 30 March. Z20 Karl Galster took part in the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in 69 September, during which she landed troops on the island. Two months later the ship sailed for Bremen to begin an overhaul. Problems with her starboard turbine, after the overhaul was finished in April 1944, put Z20 Karl Galster back in the dockyard for further work until about August when she began escorting convoys in southern Norway and helping to lay minefields in the Skagerrak. The ship continued to perform those duties until she began a brief refit in Oslo, Norway, between 20 December and 13 January 1945. Z20 Karl Galster helped to lay a minefield in the North Sea on 8 March. Afterwards, she was transferred to the Baltic and assigned to escort and patrol duties. In May, the ship was assigned to evacuate civilians and troops trapped in ports along the Baltic Sea by advancing Soviet forces. The survivors were transported to Copenhagen, Denmark. When the German troops in Denmark surrendered on 5 May, Z20 Karl Galster transferred survivors to smaller ships outside the harbour to avoid having to surrender. There the ship received an open radio transmission by Grand Admiral Groadmiral Karl Donitz asking everybody to Curry who can make it until dawn on the 8th . Donitz had chosen the word Curry to make the British believe something harmless was going on, while the German captains knew Curry to be the nickname of their former naval academy instructor, Admiral August Thiele, commander in Hela on the Hel Peninsula. So the ship's final mission led back to the Peninsula, which was one of the few remaining footholds on the coast under German control on 8 May. At 22 00, two hours before the surrender became effective, Z20 Karl Galster, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, the destroyer Z25 and two torpedo boats, T23 and T28, picked up some 1,200 to 2,000 soldiers each. Every German vessel located east of Bornholm at midnight was to return to a port under Soviet control, but Z20 Karl Galster, using its superior speed, managed to outrun pursuing Soviet torpedo boats and headed to Flensburg. From there the ship was sent to Kiel, where she surrendered to the British and was decommissioned on 10 May. After the war Z20 Karl Galster sailed to Wilhelmshaven while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over to the Soviets on 6 February 1946 in Liepaja, Latvia. She was renamed Prochnyy and assigned to the Red Banner Baltic Fleet on 5 November. Prochnyy was converted into a training ship in 1950 and was then reclassified as an accommodation ship, designated PKZ 99, on 28 November 1954. The ship was scrapped in 1958.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z20%20Karl%20Galster
"Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed a few months before the start of World War II in September 1939, the ship served as a flagship throughout her career. She briefly patrolled the Skagerrak where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp later helped to laid four offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed two British destroyers, 2 fishing trawlers, and twenty seven merchant ships. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, she sank a Norwegian coastal defense ship off Narvik and was crippled with the opening shots of the First Naval Battle of Narvik on 10 April, with the loss of 81 crewmen. The ship sank the following day. Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp had an overall length of 125.10 meters 410 ft 5 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.80 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.50 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . During Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp's sea trials, she reached 37 knots 68.5 km h 42.6 mph from 69,950 PS 51,450 kW 68,990 shp , but a full speed test was never conducted. The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp was named after Machinist's mate Obermaschinist Wilhelm Heidkamp. He was in charge of the pumps on the battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz during the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915. After a British shell started a large fire in the ship's aft gun turrets, he was badly burned when he turned the valves to flood the aft magazines, thus saving the ship. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W923 on 14 December 1937, launched on 20 August 1938, and commissioned on 20 June 1939. After working up, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp became the flagship of the Commander of Torpedo Boats Fuhrer der Torpedoboote Rear Admiral Konteradmiral Gunther Lutjens and patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in late September. On the night of 17 18 October, the ship led Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z17 Diether von Roeder, Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid a minefield off the mouth of the River Humber. The British were unaware of the minefield's existence and lost seven ships totaling 25,825 gross register tons GRT . On the night of 12 13 November Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, now the flagship of the Commander of Destroyers Fuhrer der Zerstorer , Captain Kapitan zur See Friedrich Bonte, escorted Z18 Hans Ludemann, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z20 Karl Galster as they laid 288 magnetic mines in the Thames Estuary. Once again unaware of the minefield's existence, the British lost the destroyer Blanche and thirteen merchant ships displacing 48,728 GRT. Less than a week later, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z19 Hermann Kunne, and Z11 Bernd von Arnim laid 180 magnetic mines in the Thames Estuary on the night of 17 18 November. The mines sank the destroyer Gipsy, a fishing trawler, and seven ships of 27,565 GRT. After a refit in Stettin between 27 November and 24 December, Bonte and Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp led a minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area together with Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, Z20 Karl Galster, and Z22 Anton Schmitt on the night of 10 11 January 1940. The destroyers Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z4 Richard Beitzen were also supposed to participate, but the former had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by the latter ship. The minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 GRT. Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp was the flagship for Group 1, commanded by Commodore Kommodore Bonte, for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. On 9 April, Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp sank the old coastal defense ship Eidsvold with torpedoes after an attempt to get her captain to surrender failed. Afterwards, she landed her troops in Narvik without resistance and then refuelled from the whale factory ship SS Jan Wellem. Bonte intended for his flagship to patrol the fjord during the night, but Brigadier General Generalmajor Eduard Dietl, commander of the 3rd Mountain Division, requested that Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp remain in harbor to ease coordination between the Army Heer and the Kriegsmarine and to facilitate communications with his commanders. Shortly after dawn on 10 April, the ship was moored aft of Jan Wellem, in Narvik harbor, when the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero appeared. Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp was struck in the stern by a torpedo from Hardy's first salvo that detonated the ship's aft magazine. The explosion threw her aft guns into the air and killed 81 men, including Bonte. Although Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp's stern was below water, her captain, Lieutenant Commander Korvettenkapitan Hans Erdmenger, managed to moor her to a nearby Swedish freighter. She capsized the following day, but not before her torpedoes were transferred to the surviving destroyers. Her survivors joined the other survivors ashore in an ad hoc naval infantry unit.

"Z22 Anton Schmitt was one of six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy in the late 1930s. Completed after the beginning of World War II in September 1939, she helped to lay an offensive minefield off the English coast that claimed one small ship. During the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the ship was tasked to attack Narvik and was sunk during the First Naval Battle of Narvik on 10 April. Z22 Anton Schmitt had an overall length of 125.1 meters 410 ft 5 in and was 120 meters 393 ft 8 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.8 meters 38 ft 9 in , and a maximum draft of 4.5 meters 14 ft 9 in . She displaced 2,411 long tons 2,450 t at standard load and 3,415 long tons 3,470 t at deep load.

During Z22 Anton Schmitt's sea trials on 711 November 1939, she reached 36.9 knots 68.3 km h 42.5 mph from 69,000 PS 51,000 kW 68,000 shp , but full speed trials were never conducted. The ship carried a maximum of 739 metric tons 727 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,050 nautical miles 3,800 km 2,360 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 10 officers and 313 sailors. The ship carried five 12.7 centimeter 5.0 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were numbered from 1 to 5 from front to rear.

The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an active sonar system was installed by the end of 1939. Z22 Anton Schmitt was named after Bosun's Mate Bootsmannsmaat Anton Schmitt, who was the last man at the last operating gun of the sinking light cruiser Frauenlob during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 and went down with his ship. The ship was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 6 January 1936. She was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W924 on 3 January 1938, launched on 20 September, and commissioned on 24 September 1939. After working up, Z22 Anton Schmitt helped to lay a minefield near the Newcastle area together with Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt, and Z20 Karl Galster on the night of 10 11 January 1940. The destroyers Z14 Friedrich Ihn and Z4 Richard Beitzen were also supposed to participate, but the former had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph and she had to be escorted back to Germany by the latter ship. The minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 gross register tons GRT . Z22 Anton Schmitt was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserubung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment 139. Gebirgsjager Regiment and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division 3. Gebirgs Division to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. When they arrived off the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April, Z22 Anton Schmitt and her sister Z18 Hans Ludemann landed their troops at the Ramnes narrows to search for the coastal artillery positions that the Germans mistakenly believed to command the mouth of the fjord. Z17 Diether von Roeder remained offshore to provide support if necessary and to serve as a picket ship in case the British intended to interfere with the operation. About 11 00 the troops were ordered to reboard their destroyers which proceeded to Narvik. Z22 Anton Schmitt had picket duty the following night and then sailed into Narvik harbor. Shortly after dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hardy, Havock, Hunter, Hotspur, and Hero appeared, totally surprising the Germans. Hunter hit Z22 Anton Schmitt with a single 4.7 inch 120 mm shell and with a torpedo in the forward engine room. And then Havock hit the listing ship with another torpedo that broke her in half, killing or wounding over 50 crewmen. The survivors joined the other survivors ashore in an ad hoc naval infantry unit.

"Z23 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1940, the ship spent the war in Norwegian and French waters, escorting German ships and occasionally engaging Allied warships. In early 1941 she escorted ships between the Baltic and southern Norway before spending four months protecting ships as they transited through the Bay of Biscay. A few months after the Operation Barbarossa began in June, Z23 was transferred to northern Norway where she attempted to intercept one of the Arctic convoys returning from the Soviet Union and helped to lay several minefield. Transferred to back to France in early 1943 where she resumed her former role of escorting ships through the Bay of Biscay, which were threatened by Allied aircraft and cruisers attempting to prevent Axis blockade runners from reaching port through the bay. One such mission resulted in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year, in which Z23 played a minor role. On 12 August, she was bombed by British heavy bombers and was declared a constructive total loss. The French salvaged her after the war and used her as a source of spare parts for the ex German destroyers that they had in service. The ship was condemned in 1951 and later broken up. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.9 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,603 long tons 2,645 t at standard load and 3,605 long tons 3,663 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z23 carried a maximum of 791 metric tons 779 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,500 nautical miles 4,600 km 2,900 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z23 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with either a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. Z23's single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC 38 twin gun turret during her early 1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to 32.8 knots 60.7 km h 37.7 mph . By 1944, the ship's anti aircraft suite had been augmented by a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts that may have been added during her early 1942 refit. Z23 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W957 on 15 November 1938, launched on 15 December 1939, and commissioned on 15 September 1940. After working up, she began escorting ships between the Baltic and southern Norway between March and June 1941, notably the battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruisers Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer. On 1213 June Z23 was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser Lutzow as the latter ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted Lutzow and her escorts off the Norwegian coast and one managed to surprise them and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z23 was transferred to Brest, France, on the 16th, together with her sister Z24, and they helped to escort the battleship Scharnhorst through the Bay of Biscay on 2024 July and covered the passage of the merchant raider Orion through the bay on 2128 August. They were ordered to northern Norway on 23 October. At the end of November the sisters reached Troms and was assigned to the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla , commanded by Kapitan zur See Captain Hans Erdmenger. On 17 December, Z23, along with her sisters Z24, Z25, and Z27, sortied into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25's radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of 37.5 kilometers 23.3 mi . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea. A week later, Z23 accidentally rammed Z24 in heavy fog on 20 January, forcing the latter to return to Wesermunde and the former to sail to Trondheim for repairs and a lengthy refit that lasted until August. After escorting the minelayer Ulm to Narvik, she participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the island of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters Z28, Z29, and Z30. On 2324 October, the ship escorted the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Scheer from Bogen Bay to Trondheim and continued to Copenhagen, Denmark, with Admiral Scheer, before returning to the Altafjord with the light cruiser Nurnberg. Engine problems prevented her from participating in Operation Regenbogen, an attack on Convoy JW 51B, at the end of the year. On 5 March 1943, the 8. Zerstorerflottile Z23, Z24, Z32 and Z37 was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for an attempt by the Italian blockade runner Himalaya to sail for the Far East on 28 March, but the ship had to return to Bordeaux after it was spotted by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade runner Pietro Orseolo through the Bay of Biscay despite the ship being torpedoed by an American submarine and under heavy attack by Bristol Beaufighter fighter bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers the German destroyers shot down five of the attacking aircraft. Himalaya made another attempt to break out on 9 April, but the ships were spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, they were attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attackers were shot down, but Z23 suffered 5 dead and 31 wounded during the battle. The flotilla escorted submarines through the bay for the rest of the summer. On 2426 December, the ship was one of the escorts for the 6,951 GRT blockade runner MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay. During the mission, heavy seas flooded her forecastle and she lost four men overboard before returning to Bordeaux. Another blockade runner, the 2,729 GRT refrigerated cargo ship MV Alsterufer, trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers, including Z23, of the 8. Flotille and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedobootflotille 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B 24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon. The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw spray over their forward guns that made them very hard to work. In addition the spray severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at the closest German ships, Z23 and Z27, at 13 46 at a range of 19,600 meters 21,400 yd with Enterprise following a few minutes later. Z23 fired six torpedoes once the range closed to 17,000 meters 19,000 yd , but they all missed. About that time, the destroyers began firing back. At 14 18 Erdmenger decided to split his forces and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. Z23 fired another torpedo, which also missed, five minutes later. The cruisers pursued the northern group and a hit in Z27's forward boiler room disabled one of her turbines and gradually reduced her speed. Glasgow and Enterprise concentrated their fire on the three torpedo boats after they turned south again at 14 39, sinking two of the torpedo boats. Z23 attempted to come to the drifting Z27's aid, but was ordered to disengage when Enterprise appeared. The torpedo boat T22 joined up with Z23 and the two ships reached Saint Jean de Luz, close to the Spanish border, later that day. On 30 January 1944, Z23 was carrying out exercises in the south of the Bay of Biscay with Z32 and Z37 when the former collided with Z37. The impact detonated a torpedo warhead, knocked out both turbines and started a large fire amidships. Z23 towed her to Bordeaux where she was deemed a constructive total loss. The ship resumed escorting uboats through the bay, but was docked at La Pallice when she was attacked by 14 Avro Lancaster heavy bombers on 12 August. One bomb penetrated through the forward boiler room, detonating on the harbor bottom, and another landed near by. The ship began to flood and took on a list to port unable to use her pumps until she was connected to shore power. Z23 was also deemed a constructive total loss and she was decommissioned on 20 August with all of her equipment destroyed that could not be salvaged. The French Navy refloated the ship in 1945 and towed the ship to Cherbourg in two years later to use her for spares. She was condemned on 7 October 1951 and subsequently scrapped.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z23
"Z24 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1940, the ship spent the first half of the war in Norwegian waters. She was very active in attacking the Arctic convoys ferrying war materials to the Soviet Union in 19411942, but only helped to sink one Allied ship herself. After being rearmed in late 1942, Z24 was transferred to France where she spent 1943 escorting Axis blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay and played a minor role in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of the year. After the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, she was one of the few remaining destroyers in French waters and was badly damaged during the Battle of Ushant several days later. After repairs had been completed in early August, the ship was damaged by Allied fighter bombers in mid August. Another attack later in the month by fighter bombers sank Z24. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,603 long tons 2,645 t at standard load and 3,605 long tons 3,663 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z24 carried a maximum of 791 metric tons 779 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,500 nautical miles 4,600 km 2,900 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z24 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 21 radar set above the bridge. Z24's single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC 38 twin gun turret during her late 1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to 32.8 knots 60.7 km h 37.7 mph . Around the same time Z24 received a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts and three more single 2 cm guns to give her a total of sixteen 2 cm guns. A FuMB 1 Metox radar detector was added later. When the ship docked in Brest, France, in June 1944, a pair of quadruple 2 cm mounts replaced single guns that had been mounted amidships. Z24 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W958 on 2 January 1939, launched on 7 March 1940, and commissioned on 23 October. After working up, she began escorting ships between the Baltic and Norway in March 1941. On 1213 June Z24 was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser Lutzow as the latter ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Several Bristol Beaufort aircraft spotted Lutzow and her escorts off the Norwegian coast and one managed to surprise them and torpedo the cruiser early on the morning of 13 June, forcing her to return to Germany for repairs. Z24 was transferred to Brest on the 16th, together with her sister Z23, and they helped to escort the battleship Scharnhorst through the Bay of Biscay on 2024 July and covered the passage of the merchant raider Orion through the bay on 2128 August. They were ordered to northern Norway on 23 October. At the end of November the sisters reached Troms and was assigned to the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla . On 17 December, Z24, along with her sisters Z23, Z25, and Z27, sortied into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25's radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of 37.5 kilometers 23.3 mi . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea. A week later, Z23 accidentally rammed Z24 in heavy fog on 20 January, forcing the latter to return to Wesermunde for repairs. After they were completed, the ship escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper to Norway on 18 March. Ten days later, Z24 and her sisters Z25 and Z26 departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13. Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger then sank the straggling 4,687 gross register ton GRT freighter SS Bateau. They rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ships with her radar at 08 49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around the same time. Both sides opened fire at the point blank range of 3,200 yards 2,900 m in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, badly damaging her, and then switched to Z25 without making any hits. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. The British ships maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters. Trinidad and Fury pursued Z26 and further damaged her before Trinidad was crippled by one of her own torpedoes. The destroyer HMS Eclipse took up the pursuit after Fury turned away to render assistance to the cruiser. After the sixth hit made by the British destroyer, Z26 lost power at 10 20 and was listing to port with her stern awash. Eclipse was maneuvering to give the German destroyer the coup de grace with a torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10 35. The German ships did not purse Eclipse, preferring to heave to and take off 88 survivors from Z26. The two destroyers, now reinforced by Z7 Hermann Schoemann and assigned to Zerstorergruppe Arktis Destroyer Group Arctic , commanded by Kapitan zur See Captain Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, searched unsuccessfully for Convoys PQ 14 and QP 10 on 11 April. On 30 April the German submarine U 456 torpedoed and crippled the light cruiser Edinburgh, part of the close escort for Convoy QP 11. Later that day, the trio of destroyers were ordered to intercept her. The following afternoon they encountered the main body of the convoy and attacked in limited visibility. Over the next four hours, they made five attempts to close with the convoy, but the four escorting British destroyers were able to keep themselves between the Germans and the convoy. After being rebuffed, Schulze Hinrichs decided to break off the attack and search for his original objective. The German ships were only able to sink the 2,847 GRT freighter, SS Tsiolkovsky, with torpedoes from Z24 and Z25, and badly damage the escort destroyer Amazon with gunfire. The British ships did not make any hits on the German destroyers. Later that day, Edinburgh's original escort of two destroyers was augmented by four British minesweepers and a small Russian tugboat. The cruiser was steaming under her own power at a speed of about 3 knots 5.6 km h 3.5 mph by the morning of 2 May with steering provided by the tugboat. She was spotted by the Germans and Z7 Hermann Schoemann exchanged fire with the minesweeper Harrier at about 06 27. Edinburgh then cast off her tow and increased speed to her maximum of about 8 knots 15 km h 9.2 mph , steering in a circle. Z7 Hermann Schoemann maneuvered at 21 knots 39 km h 24 mph to obtain a good position from which to fire torpedoes once the range closed to 2,800 meters 3,100 yd . At 06 36, the cruiser opened fire, with the first salvo only missing by about 100 meters 110 yd . The destroyer immediately turned away, increased speed to 31 knots 57 km h 36 mph , and started making smoke, but to no avail as the second salvo set her on fire and severed the main steam line, which disabled the engines. Z25 initially engaged the destroyer Forester, hitting her three times at about 06 50, which disabled two guns and knocked out her power with a hit in her forward boiler room. Her sister Foresight passed in front of Forester a few minutes later to draw the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded all too well as she was hit four times by 07 24, disabling the engines and leaving her with only a single gun operable. In the meantime, the cruiser had been hit once more by a torpedo at 07 02, although it only knocked out her engines and gave her a list to port. Rather than sink any of the three disabled British ships or the lightly armed minesweepers, Z24 and Z25 concentrated on rescuing the crew of the drifting Z7 Hermann Schoemann despite occasional British shells. The former made multiple attempts to come alongside to take off about 210 survivors while the latter laid a smoke screen. Z7 Hermann Schoemann was then scuttled using her own depth charges. Z24 was unscathed during the battle, but Z25 was hit once. The ship took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rosselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in early July. Lutzow and her sister Admiral Scheer formed one group in Narvik with Z24 and four of her sisters while Admiral Hipper and the battleship Tirpitz composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, Lutzow and three destroyers of Tirpitz's escort ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. On 12 July Z24 escorted one of the damaged destroyers to Kiel and then began a lengthy refit at Wesermunde that lasted until January 1943. On 5 March 1943, the 8. Zerstorerflottile Z23, Z24, Z32 and Z37 was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre en route. The flotilla provided distant cover for an attempt by the Italian blockade runner Himalaya to sail for the Far East on 28 March, but the ship had to return to Bordeaux after it was spotted by a British reconnaissance aircraft. Two days later, the flotilla escorted the Italian blockade runner Pietro Orseolo through the Bay of Biscay despite the ship being torpedoed by an American submarine and under heavy attack by Bristol Beaufighter fighter bombers and Beaufort torpedo bombers the German destroyers shot down five of the attacking aircraft. Himalaya made another attempt to break out on 9 April, but the ships were spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat. After reversing course, they were attacked by Vickers Wellington bombers and Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers. Five of the attackers were shot down. On 14 June Z24 and Z32 sortied into the Bay of Biscay to take off the survivors of the sunken German submarine U 564 which had been rescued by U 185. The flotilla escorted submarines through the bay for the rest of the summer. On 2426 December, the ship was one of the escorts for the 6,951 GRT blockade runner MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay. Another blockade runner, the 2,729 GRT refrigerated cargo ship MV Alsterufer, trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers, including Z24, of the 8. Flotille and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedobootflotille 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B 24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon. At about midday on 28 December, the British cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, on patrol in the Bay of Biscay to intercept blockade runners, intercepted the German destroyers and torpedo boats, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. Heavy seas prevented the German force from using its theoretical advantage in speed and firepower, with the destroyer Z27 and the torpedo boats T25 and T27 sunk. Z24 was neither engaged by the British cruisers nor fired its weapons and suffered engine problems during the battle. The ship began a refit at La Pallice on 14 January 1944 that was completed in early May. After word of the Allied landings at Normandy on 6 June was received by Kapitan zur See Theodor von Bechtolsheim, commander of the 8. Zerstorerflottile, ordered his three remaining destroyers, Z24, Z32, ZH1, and the torpedo boat T24, to sail for Brest to begin operations against the invasion fleet. They were attacked by Beaufighters during their journey, with Z32 damaged by a pair of rockets and one aircraft forced to ditch. Once they reached Brest, Z24 and Z32 had their anti aircraft suites reinforced. On the night of 8 9 June, the four ships set out from Brest for Cherbourg, but were intercepted by eight Allied destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla in the Battle of Ushant. The German ships had been spotted first and the British opened fire first, with the Germans responding with a four torpedo salvo from each destroyer that missed when the Allied ships turned to evade them. Their fire was extremely effective with Z24 badly damaged only moments after firing her first salvo. The range was so close that both sides engaged with their 40 mm 1.6 in or 37 mm anti aircraft guns which appreciably added to the damaged suffered by Z24. The Allied ships hit the German destroyer with five 4.7 in 120 mm shells before she was able to lay smoke and disengage. The first shell struck the 15 cm loading room for the turret, severing all communication with the turret, while another shell devastated the forward superstructure, killing 13 men, and set the radio room on fire. Other shells hit the forward engine room, set the aft funnel and some ready use ammunition on fire and destroyed one of the amidships quadruple 2 cm gun mounts. Two Canadian destroyers pursued Z24 and T24 until the German ships passed over a minefield and they reached Brest later in that evening. The ship was under repair at Bordeaux from 13 July to 5 August, but was attacked by Allied fighter bombers on the 14th off Royan. She was struck by five rockets and ninety 20 mm shells that damaged her superstructure and gun turret. Z24 returned to Bordeaux for repairs, but was attacked by rocket carrying Beaufighters off Le Verdon sur Mer on 24 August. The ship was struck three times with one dead and another wounded from the attack. She managed to come alongside a quay the next day, but later capsized and sank. Her crew was incorporated into the defender of Festung Gironde Fortress Gironde that held out until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z24
"Z25 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1940, the ship spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields, despite venturing to France in early 1942 to successfully escort two battleships and a heavy cruiser home through the English Channel the Channel Dash . She was very active in attacking the Arctic convoys ferrying war materials to the Soviet Union in 19411942, but only helped to sink one Allied ship herself. Engine problems in 1943 severely restricted her activities and she was transferred to the Baltic in early 1944 after repairs were completed. Z25 spent most of the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships. She was ultimately allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Hoche. She became operational later that year and cruised to French colonies in Africa during 1947. The ship was placed in reserve in early 1949 before beginning a reconstruction from 19501953 that converted her into a fast destroyer escort. Worn out by 1956, Hoche was deemed too expensive to repair and decommissioned later that year. The ship was condemned in 1958 and scrapped in 1961. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.43 meters 14 ft 6 in . They displaced 2,543 long tons 2,584 t at standard load and 3,543 long tons 3,600 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z25 carried a maximum of 791 metric tons 779 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,500 nautical miles 4,600 km 2,900 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. They were designated No. 1 to 4 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z25 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. Z25's single forward 15 cm gun was exchanged for a 15 cm LC 38 twin gun turret during her mid 1942 refit. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to 32.8 knots 60.7 km h 37.7 mph . No. 3 gun was later removed to make room for additional AA guns under the 1944 Barbara program. By the end of the war, her anti aircraft suite consisted of ten 3.7 cm guns in single and twin mounts and sixteen 2 cm weapons in twin and quadruple mounts. Most, if not all, of the 3.7 cm guns were to be the faster firing Flak M42 model. A FuMO 21 radar replaced the FuMO 24 25 in 1944 and FuMB 1 Metox, FuMB 3 Bali, and FuMB 6 Palau radar detectors were added that same year. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. Z25 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W959 on 15 February 1939, launched on 16 March 1940, and commissioned on 30 November. She finished working up on 26 June 1941 and sailed for Norway, but ran aground off Haugesund, damaging both propellers, and had to return to Bremen for repairs. Z25 was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, a temporary formation built around the battleship Tirpitz, as it sortied into the Sea of Aland on 2329 September to forestall any attempt by the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet to breakout from the Gulf of Finland. Two months later Z25 accompanied her sister ships, Z23 and Z27 from Germany to Norway and arrived in Troms on 6 December where she was assigned to the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla . After arriving in Kirkenes, the ship replaced Z26 as the flagship of Kapitan zur See Captain Hans Erdmenger, commander of the flotilla, as the latter destroyer had engine problems and had to return to Germany for repairs. She led her sisters Z23, Z24 and Z27 out into the Barents Sea on 16 December 1941, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25's radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of 37.5 kilometers 23.3 mi . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes between them, but were only able to launch one each. On 13 January 1942, Z25 escorted Z23 and Z24 as they laid a minefield in the western channel of the White Sea. On the 29th, Z25 sailed from Kirkenes to rendezvous with the destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann at Vlissingen, the Netherlands, before continuing onward together to Brest, France, where they arrived on 7 February as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, totally surprising the British. During the sporadic attacks by the British, Z25 is not known to have engaged any British ships or aircraft, not was she damaged in any way. Shortly afterwards, the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting the heavy cruisers Prinz Eugen and Admiral Scheer to Trondheim. Heavy weather forced three of the destroyers to return to port before reaching their destination and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation. On 6 March, Tirpitz, escorted by Z25 and three other destroyers, sortied to attack the returning Convoy QP 8 and the Russia bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast Sports Palace . The following morning, Admiral Otto Ciliax, commanding the operation, ordered the destroyers to search independently for Allied ships and they stumbled across the 2,815 gross register ton GRT Soviet freighter SS Ijora, a straggler from QP 8, later that afternoon and sank her. Tirpitz rejoined them shortly afterwards and Ciliax ordered the destroyers back to Trondheim on the 8th after failing to refuel them the previous night due to heavy seas and icing. On 28 March, Z26 and her sisters Z24 and Z25 departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13. Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger then sank the straggling 4,687 GRT freighter SS Bateau. They rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ships with her radar at 08 49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around that same time. Both sides opened fire at the point blank range of 3,200 yards 2,900 m in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, badly damaging her, and then switched to Z25 without making any hits. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. The British ships maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and Z26 accidentally became separated from her sisters. After Fury turned away to render assistance to the cruiser, the destroyer HMS Eclipse took up the pursuit, crippling Z26 by 10 20. Eclipse was maneuvering to give the German destroyer the coup de grace with a torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10 35. The German ships did not purse Eclipse, preferring to heave to and take off 88 survivors from Z26. The two destroyers, now reinforced by Z7 Hermann Schoemann and assigned to Zerstorergruppe Arktis Destroyer Group Arctic , commanded by Kapitan zur See Alfred Schulze Hinrichs, searched unsuccessfully for Convoys PQ 14 and QP 10 on 11 April. On 30 April German submarine U 456 torpedoed and crippled the light cruiser Edinburgh, part of the close escort for Convoy QP 11. Later that day, the trio of destroyers were ordered to intercept her. The following afternoon they encountered the main body of the convoy and attacked in limited visibility. Over the next four hours, they made five attempts to close with the convoy, but the four escorting British destroyers were able to keep themselves between the Germans and the convoy. After being rebuffed, Schulze Hinrichs decided to break off the attack and search for his original objective. The German ships were only able to sink the 2,847 GRT freighter, SS Tsiolkovsky, with torpedoes from Z24 and Z25, and badly damage the escort destroyer Amazon with gunfire. The British ships did not make any hits on the German destroyers. Later that day, Edinburgh's original escort of two destroyers was augmented by four British minesweepers and a small Russian tugboat. The cruiser was steaming under her own power at a speed of about 3 knots 5.6 km h 3.5 mph by the morning of 2 May with steering provided by the tugboat. She was spotted by the Germans and Z7 Hermann Schoemann exchanged fire with the minesweeper Harrier at about 06 27. Edinburgh then cast off her tow and increased speed to her maximum of about 8 knots 15 km h 9.2 mph , steering in a circle. While Z7 Hermann Schoemann maneuvered to obtain a good position from which to fire torpedoes, the cruiser opened fire at 06 36, almost immediately severing the main steam line, which disabled the engines. Z25 initially engaged the destroyer Forester, hitting her three times at about 06 50, which disabled two guns and knocked out her power with a hit in her forward boiler room. Her sister Foresight passed in front of Forester a few minutes later to draw the attention of Z24 and Z25, which succeeded all too well as she was hit four times by 07 24, disabling the engines and leaving her with only a single gun operable. In the meantime, the cruiser had been hit once more by a torpedo at 07 02, although it only knocked out her engines and gave her a list to port. Rather than sink any of the three disabled British ships or the lightly armed minesweepers, Z24 and Z25 concentrated on rescuing the crew of the drifting Z7 Hermann Schoemann despite occasional British shells. The former made multiple attempts to come alongside to take off about 210 survivors while the latter laid a smoke screen. Z7 Hermann Schoemann was then scuttled using her own depth charges. Z24 was unscathed during the battle, but Z25 was hit in the radio room, killing four and wounding seven. In Operation Zauberflote Magic Flute , Z25, the destroyer Z5 Paul Jacobi, and two torpedo boats escorted the badly damaged Prinz Eugen from Trondheim to Kiel from 1618 May. Shortly after her arrival, the destroyer began a lengthy refit that lasted until November. On 11 November, the ship escorted the light cruiser Nurnberg from Swinemunde to Trondheim. In February 1943, she sailed to Germany in preparation for continuing onward to France, but engine problems caused that plan to be cancelled on 5 March. Z25 returned to Norwegian waters on April 22, but continuing engine problems kept her mostly inactive before her return to Germany for an overhaul in August. While running sea trials in Danzig Bay, the shock wave from a nearby mine explosion disabled her port turbine and required further repairs. Now assigned to the 6. Zerstorerflotille, Z25 and the other three destroyers of the flotilla were transferred to the Gulf of Finland to support minelaying operations there, Z25 arriving at Reval, Estonia, on 13 February 1944. The flotilla was initially tasked to escort convoys between Libau, Latvia, and Reval, but laid its first minefield in Narva Bay on 12 March while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of the bay. They were primarily tasked as minelayers through July. In preparation for Operation Tanne West, the occupation of the Aland Islands in case of Finnish surrender, the flotilla escorted the heavy cruiser Lutzow to the island of Uto on 28 June, but the operation was canceled and the ships returned to port. On 30 July and 1 August Z25 and three other destroyers of the flotilla sailed into the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland. On 5 August, they escorted Prinz Eugen as she engaged targets on the island of Oesel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 1920 August. Between 15 and 20 September, the ship helped to evacuate 23,172 people from Reval in the face of the advancing Soviets. On 21 August, the ship, together with the destroyer Z28, ferried 370 people from Baltischport, Estonia, to Libau. The following day, she escorted ships loaded with evacuees from the Sea of Aland to Gotenhafen, Germany. On 10 October, Z25 ferried 200 reinforcements to Memel and evacuated 200 female naval auxiliaries the next day. Upon her return, the ship bombarded targets near Memel. She was then slightly damaged by a presumed near miss from a torpedo and the vibrations from her own guns caused an oil leak on one of her fuel tanks. On 4 November, Z25 was transferred to the 8. Zerstorerflotille and supported Lutzow and Prinz Eugen as they engaged Soviet positions in Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, between 19 and 24 November. She was refitted in December and then bombarded Soviet troops east and south of Konigsberg, together with Prinz Eugen and two torpedo boats on 2930 January 1945 and again on 25 February to allow cut off German Army units to break through into friendly territory. The ship then escorted many refugee ships carrying evacuees between Gotenhafen and Sassnitz before bombarding Soviet positions near the former city on the 20th. A month later, Z25 and Z5 Paul Jacobi escorted the ocean liner Potsdam, the troopship SS Goya and the target ship Canonier as they ferried 22,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark, on 26 March. The ship continued to escort refugee ships between Hela and friendly territory through April and into May. On the 5th, she helped to convey 45,000 refugees to Copenhagen and returned to ferry 20,000 more to Glucksburg, Germany, on the 9th. The following day, Z25 was decommissioned. After the war Z25 sailed to Wilhelmshaven and was overhauled to keep her seaworthy while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to Great Britain in late 1945 and arrived in Rosyth, Scotland, on 6 January 1946. Following protests by France over her exclusion, the British transferred four of the destroyers that they had been allotted and Z25 arrived in Cherbourg on 2 February. Two days later, she was commissioned into the French Navy with the name of Hoche, after General Lazare Hoche. The ship was assigned to the 1st Division of Large Destroyers contre torpilleurs and entered service in September when she conducted training with the light carrier Arromanches. In MarchJune 1947, she formed part of the escort for the battleship Richelieu as the President of France, Vincent Auriol, visited West and North Africa. Hoche visited Portsmouth, England, in December 1948 before she was reduced to reserve on 1 January 1949. From 1950 to 1953, the ship was rebuilt into a escorteur rapide fast escort destroyer with new weapons and electronics and was based in Toulon for anti submarine trials. A major refit was necessary by 1956, but it was not economical and she was placed in reserve on 20 August before being decommissioned on 1 September. Hoche was condemned and redesignated Q102 on 2 January 1958 she was listed for sale on 30 June and scrapped in 1961.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z25
"Z26 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in early 1941, the ship spent her active career in Norwegian waters. She first arrived there in November, but was plagued with engine problems and had to return to Germany for repairs in January 1942. Z26 returned to Norway two months later and became flagship of a destroyer flotilla. Together with two of her sisters, she attempted to intercept Convoy PQ 13. They rescued survivors from an already sunken ship before Z26 sank one straggler from the convoy. The three destroyers were spotted by a British light cruiser that badly damaged Z26 before one of the cruiser's torpedoes circled back around and crippled her. Pursuit of Z26 was taken over by a British destroyer that so badly damaged her that she was drifting and on fire when the timely arrival of the other two German destroyers prevented the British ship from sinking Z26. They were able to rescue 88 survivors and a submarine later rescued 8 others 243 crewmen were killed in the battle. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,543 long tons 2,584 t at standard load and 3,543 long tons 3,600 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z26 carried a maximum of 791 metric tons 779 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,500 nautical miles 4,600 km 2,900 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z26 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. Z26 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W960 on 1 April 1939, launched on 2 April 1940, and commissioned on 9 January 1941. She was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, a temporary formation built around the battleship Tirpitz, as it sortied into the Sea of Aland on 2329 September to forestall any attempt by the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet to break out from the Gulf of Finland. On 9 November, Z26 and her sister ship Z24 sailed for northern Norway at Troms her lubrication pump for her starboard low pressure turbine broke down, destroying the rotor blades. With her repairs completed by 14 December, she joined her sisters of the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla at Kirkenes, although another lubrication pump broke down and she could not participate in the planned sortie off the Murmansk coast. Still plagued by machinery troubles, Z26 departed for Germany on 5 January 1942 for a refit. Refit completed, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper from Brunsbuttel, Germany, to Trondheim, Norway, on 18 March and then accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Trondheim to Narvik, reaching Kirkenes on the 27th. On 28 March, Z26, now the flagship of Kapitan zur See Gottfried Ponitz, commander of the 8. Flotille, departed the Varangerfjord in an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 13 together with her sisters Z24 and Z25. Later that night they rescued 61 survivors of the sunken freighter SS Empire Ranger then sank the straggling 4,687 gross register ton GRT freighter SS Bateau. Z26 attacked her with gunfire, then finished her off with a torpedo. The Germans rescued 7 survivors before resuming the search for the convoy. The light cruiser HMS Trinidad, escorted by the destroyer HMS Fury, spotted the German ships with her radar at 08 49 on the 29th and was spotted herself around that same time. Both sides opened fire at the point blank range of 3,200 yards 2,900 m in a snowstorm. Trinidad engaged the leading German destroyer, Z26, and hit her with her second salvo from her forward guns. Her shells knocked out two 15 cm guns, damaged the port turbine room and started a large fire. Between them the destroyers fired 19 torpedoes at the cruiser, all of which missed after Trinidad turned away, and hit her twice with their 15 cm guns, inflicting only minor damage. Both sides maneuvered to avoid torpedoes, which forced them to disengage, and accidentally separated Z26 from her sisters. Trinidad's radar found the damaged destroyer and the cruiser altered course and increased speed to intercept. She opened fire at 09 17 at a range of 2,900 yards 2,700 m at the wildly maneuvering Z26, scoring only three hits from 37 main gun salvoes. Trying to finish off the badly damaged destroyer, Trinidad fired a single torpedo five minutes later two other torpedoes failed to leave their tubes due to icing. The one torpedo circled back around and struck Trinidad, crippling the cruiser. The German destroyer attempted to disengage, but Fury, which had not yet fired during the battle, set off in pursuit. Z26 passed by three destroyers of the convoy's escort, but only the two Soviet ships, Sokrushitel'nyy and Gremyashchiy, fired at her through the snow HMS Eclipse thought the German ship was Trinidad. Fury fired two salvoes without effect at Eclipse at 09 30 before recognizing her as friendly and turned back to render assistance to Trinidad. Eclipse then took up the pursuit and her radar spotted Z26 at a range of about 2 nautical miles 3.7 km 2.3 mi . She opened fire when the range decreased to 800 yards 730 m . The German ship attempted to disengage under the cover of a smoke screen, but was unsuccessful as Eclipse continued to hit her. After the sixth hit, Z26 lost power at 10 20 and was listing to port with her stern awash. The British destroyer was maneouvering to give the German destroyer the coup de grace with her last torpedo when the snowstorm ended and visibility increased, revealing Z24 and Z25 approaching. They promptly opened fire at Eclipse, hitting her twice and wounding nine men, before she could find cover in a squall at 10 35. The German ships did not purse Eclipse, preferring to heave to and take off 88 survivors. The German submarine U 376 later picked up another 8, although 243 crewmen were killed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z26
"Z27 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1941, the ship was transferred to Norwegian waters later that year where she remained for most of the next several years, escorting convoys and laying minefields. She sank a Soviet oil tanker in late 1942 before sailing to Germany for a refit. Upon its completion in mid 1943, Z27 returned to Norway and participated in Operation Zitronella, the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September. The ship sailed to France the following month and became the flagship of the 8. Zerstorerflottile 8th Destroyer Flotilla upon her arrival. The flotilla was tasked to escort several blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay in December despite Allied efforts to find and sink them. The first ship made it through the gauntlet successfully, but the second one was found and sunk while the German ships were en route to the rendezvous point. They were intercepted by a pair of British light cruisers and Z27 was sunk during the ensuing Battle of the Bay of Biscay on 28 December, with the loss of approximately 300 of her crew. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,543 long tons 2,584 t at standard load and 3,543 long tons 3,600 t at deep load.

Z27 carried a maximum of 791 metric tons 779 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,500 nautical miles 4,600 km 2,900 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and seven 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z27 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. While precise data is unavailable, Z27 probably received a pair of 2 cm quadruple mounts during 1942, most likely replacing several single mounts. Z27 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W961 on 27 December 1939, launched on 1 August 1940, and commissioned on 26 February 1941. Her first commander was Korvettenkapitan Lieutenant Commander Karl Smidt. While still working up, she was assigned to escort the Baltic Fleet, a temporary formation built around the battleship Tirpitz, as it sortied into the Sea of Aland on 2329 September to forestall any attempt by the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet to breakout from the Gulf of Finland. Two months later Z27 accompanied her sister ships, Z23 and Z25, from Germany to Norway and arrived in Troms on 6 December where she was briefly assigned to the 8. Zerstorerflottile. She was one of four destroyers that sailed into the Barents Sea on 16 December, searching for Allied ships off the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The following day, Z25's radar spotted two ships in heavy fog at a range of 37.5 kilometers 23.3 mi . The Germans thought that they were Soviet destroyers, but they were actually two British minesweepers, Hazard and Speedy, sailing to rendezvous with Convoy QP 6. The Germans intercepted them, but the heavy fog and icing precluded accurate gunfire. The British ships were able to escape despite four hits on Speedy and the heavy expenditure of ammunition Z25 and Z27 attempted to fire 11 torpedoes between them, but were only able to launch one each. Z27 then developed problems with her propeller shaft and sailed for Germany on 5 January 1942 to begin a refit. The ship returned to Norway on May and took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rosselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in early July. The heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and her sister Lutzow formed one group in Narvik with Z27 and four of her sisters while Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, Lutzow and three destroyers of Tirpitz's escort ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. On 1315 October, Z27, her sister Z30 and the destroyers Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea that sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November. While searching for convoy traffic at the far end of the patrol line, Z27 was alerted to the presence of a tanker by the Admiral Hipper's float plane on 7 November and set off in pursuit. The destroyer first intercepted and sank the submarine chaser BO 78 then caught up to and sank the westbound 8,000 gross register ton GRT Soviet oil tanker Donbass, rescuing survivors from both ships. On 2 December, Z27 sailed to Bremen to begin a refit, returning to Norway on 15 June 1943. Together with Z30, she conducted several minelaying missions off southern Norway between 19 and 28 June. The ship took part in the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September, during which she landed troops on the island. On the 24th she was one of four destroyers escorting Lutzow to Kiel, Germany, and then proceeded to France on 31 October, together with the destroyer ZH1. During the voyage to Le Verdon sur Mer, both ships were slightly damaged by splinters from British coastal artillery as they passed through the English Channel. On 5 November they were unsuccessfully attacked by British motor torpedo boats off Cap d'Antifer, damaging several of their assailants. Now the flagship of Kapitan zur See Captain Hans Erdmenger, commander of the 8. Zerstorerflotille, the ship was one of the escorts for the 6,951 GRT blockade runner MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay. Another blockade runner, the 2,729 GRT refrigerated cargo ship MV Alsterufer, trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers, including Z27, of the 8. Flotille and six torpedo boats of the 4. Torpedobootflotille 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B 24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon. The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw spray over their forward guns that made them very hard to work. In addition the spray severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at the closest German ships, Z27 and her sister Z23, at 13 46 at a range of 19,600 meters 21,400 yd with Enterprise following a few minutes later. Z23 fired six torpedoes once the range closed to 17,000 meters 19,000 yd , but they all missed. About that time, the destroyers began firing back. At 14 28 Z27 fired a spread of four torpedoes, which also missed, shortly after Erdmenger decided to split his forces and ordered Z23, Z27, and three torpedo boats to reverse course to the north. Seven minutes later, Z27 fired the rest of her ready torpedoes, all of which missed their target. The British ships pursued the northern group and a shell from Enterprise hit the destroyer in No. 2 boiler room shortly afterwards, severing the starboard main steam line, which forced the evacuation of the boiler room and knocked out the starboard turbine. The effects of the damage began to accumulate and the other boilers began to fail over the next hour or so, as did the feed pumps for the port turbine. While pursuing the scattered German forces several hours later, Glasgow spotted the drifting Z27 and closed to point blank range before sinking her with gunfire at 16 41. A total of 93 men were rescued by a German submarine, Spanish destroyers, and an Irish merchantman, MV Kerlogue, but about 300 crewmen were killed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z27
"Z28 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine Germany Navy during World War II. Built as a flotilla leader with fewer guns than her sister ships, she was completed in 1941. The ship spent most of the first few years of her service in Norwegian waters, escorting convoys and laying minefields. Z28 ran aground in early 1943 and spent the rest of the year under repair. The ship briefly returned to Norway at the beginning of 1944, but was transferred to the Baltic shortly afterwards to support minelaying operations in the Gulf of Finland. That was her primary focus through July and then she began escorting German cruisers as they bombarded Soviet troops ashore in addition to German convoys evacuating people from Finland and the Baltic States. Z28 also bombarded Soviet positions herself on multiple occasions until she was damaged by bombs during one such mission in October. Her repairs took until February 1945 and, not long afterwards, she was sunk in port by British bombers on 6 March with heavy loss of life. Z28 had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and was 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.38 meters 14 ft 4 in . She displaced 2,596 long tons 2,638 t at standard load and 3,519 long tons 3,575 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z28 carried a maximum of 804 metric tons 791 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,900 nautical miles 5,400 km 3,300 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. Z28 carried four 15 cm TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two guns each superimposed fore and aft of the superstructure. To accommodate the flotilla commander and his staff, one gun was repositioned from atop the aft superstructure to the upper forward position and the aft superstructure enlarged. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C 30 guns in single mounts. The Type 36A ships carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21.0 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. A S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. During 19421943, Z28's anti aircraft armament was increased to ten each 3.7 cm and 2 cm guns. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. Z28 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W962 on 30 November 1939, launched on 20 August 1940, and commissioned on 9 August 1941. Her first commander was Korvettenkapitan Lieutenant Commander Hans Erdmenger. While working up from late 1941 to early 1942, she was based in Aarhus, Denmark, and patrolled the Skagerrak and Kattegat. The ship was transferred to Norway in April where she escorted convoys with her sister Z30 and a pair of torpedo boats, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer and the replenishment oiler Dithmarschen to Narvik on 9 May. Z28 took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rosselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in July. Admiral Scheer and her sister Lutzow formed one group in Narvik with Z28 and four of her sisters while the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, Lutzow and three destroyers of Tirpitz's escort ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. She participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the coast of the island of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters Z23, Z29, and Z30. On 1 October, Z28 escorted Admiral Hipper from Altafjord to Bogen Bay and then Tirpitz and Admiral Scheer to Trondheim on the 24th. She continued on to Kiel, Germany, to begin a refit. In early March 1943, she was one of the escorts of the battleship Scharnhorst on her voyage to Bogen Bay, the only one not to sustain weather damage. While sailing from Altafjord to Harstad with the destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen on 2 April, Z28 ran aground. She sailed to Trondheim for repairs and was slightly damaged during an air raid on the docks there on 24 July. The ship then returned to Deschimag's dockyard in Bremen for complete repairs. She was based in Kristiansand, Norway, for anti contraband patrols from 7 January 1944 and was now assigned to the 6. Zerstorerflotille 6th Destroyer Flotilla . On 1213 February, Z28 and two other destroyers from the flotilla laid a minefield in the Skagerrak. Shortly afterwards, the 6th Flotilla was transferred to the Gulf of Finland to support minelaying operations there, Z28 arriving at Reval, Estonia, on 21 February. The flotilla was initially tasked to escort convoys between Libau, Latvia, and Reval, but laid its first minefield in Narva Bay on 12 March while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of the bay. They were primarily tasked as minelayers through July. In preparation for Operation Tanne West, the occupation of the Aland Islands in case of Finnish surrender, the flotilla escorted Lutzow to the island of Uto on 28 June, but the operation was canceled and the ships returned to port. On 30 July and 1 August Z28 and three other destroyers of the flotilla sailed into the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland. On 5 August, they escorted the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen as she engaged targets on the island of Oesel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 1920 August. Z28 and the destroyer Z36 escorted the troopship MV Monte Rosa, laden with refugees, from Baltischport, Estonia, to Gotenhafen, Germany, on 16 September. Four days later, the ship helped to evacuate 23,172 people from Reval in the face of the advancing Soviets. The following day, the ship, together with the destroyer Z25, ferried 370 people from Baltischport to Libau. On 22 August, she escorted ships loaded with evacuees from the Sea of Aland to Gotenhafen. Z28 resumed her shore bombardment missions on 10 October, attacking targets at Memel on that date and the 23rd. She engaged Soviet positions in Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, on the 22nd and 24th. During the latter mission, she was damaged by Soviet aircraft, killing nine crewmen and wounding many others, and sailed for Swinemunde for repairs. They were completed on 25 February 1945 and Z28 escorted the ocean liner Deutschland from Gotenhafen to Sassnitz two days later as it evacuated Germans from the Polish Corridor as part of Operation Hannibal. After repeating the mission on 4 March, the ship was sunk with heavy casualties in the latter port two days later by the Royal Air Force after being hit by two bombs amidships.

"Z29 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1941, she took part in the Channel Dash in early 1942 as flagship of the escort force. Despite this venture to France, the ship spent most of the war in Norwegian waters, escorting German ships and laying minefields. Z29 participated in the indecisive Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year, during which she helped to sink a British minesweeper. The ship was damaged during the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September 1943. Z29 was damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship Tirpitz in July 1944. The ship escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October until she began an extensive refit in December. The war ended before the refit was completed and the ship was surrendered to the Allies in Germany. She was allocated to the United States when they divided up the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine in late 1945. Still not fully seaworthy, Z29 was scuttled by the Americans in late 1946. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,657 long tons 2,700 t at standard load and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z29 carried a maximum of 825 metric tons 812 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,950 nautical miles 5,460 km 3,390 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. They were designated No. 1 to 4 from front to rear. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and seven 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z29 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. During her 19441945 refit, Z29 exchanged her single forward 15 cm gun for a 15 cm LC 38 twin gun turret as used in her sister ships. This exacerbated the Type 36A's tendency to take water over the bow and reduced their speed to 32.8 knots 60.7 km h 37.7 mph . No. 3 gun was also removed to make room for additional AA guns under the Barbara program. By the end of the war, her anti aircraft suite consisted of two experimental 5.5 centimeter 2.2 in Gerat 58 guns probably , nine 3.7 cm guns in single and twin mounts and twenty 2 cm weapons in single, twin, and quadruple mounts. Most, if not all, of the 3.7 cm guns were to be the faster firing Flak M42 model. Z29 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W963 on 21 March 1940 and launched on 15 October. The ship commissioned on 25 June 1941 under the command of Korvettenkapitan Lieutenant Commander Curt Rechel. After working up, Z29 was one of the escorts for Tirpitz from the Jade Estuary to Trondheim, Norway and returned to Kiel, Germany from 14 to 17 January 1942. The ship sailed on 27 January for Brest, France, as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. The German ships departed Brest on 11 February, surprising the British, with Z29 leading the formation as the flagship of the Fuhrer der Zerstorer Commander of the Destroyer Force , Kapitan zur See Captain Erich Bey, who commanded the escorts. British attacks on the German ships were generally ineffective until the battleship Scharnhorst struck a mine off the mouth of the Scheldt Estuary at 15 30. Vizeadmiral Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax, overall commander of the German force, summoned Z29 to take him aboard from the immobilized battleship. While the destroyer was attempting to close, she accidentally collided with the battleship's stern, damaging her forecastle, but managed to take off Ciliax. Later that day, a 15 cm shell exploded in one of the aft guns, killing one man, severing oil lines, and knocking out the port turbine. Ciliax transferred to the destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann at 18 25 and Z29 proceeded to Wesermunde for repairs. After they were completed, she was part of the screen for the heavy cruiser Lutzow from 15 to 26 May as she moved from Germany to Bogen Bay, Norway and laid a minefield in the Skagerrak en route. On 58 September Z29, her sister Z30, and the destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen laid a minefield in the Kara Strait between the island of Novaya Zemlya and Vaygach Island. Later that month, she participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the coast of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters Z23, Z28, and Z30. On 2324 October, the ship escorted Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Bogen Bay to Trondheim and continued to Copenhagen, Denmark, with Admiral Scheer, before returning to the Altafjord with the light cruiser Nurnberg. On 30 December, Lutzow and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper, escorted by six destroyers, including Z29, left Narvik for Operation Regenbogen, an attack on Convoy JW 51B, which was reported by German intelligence to be lightly escorted. Vizeadmiral Oskar Kummetz's plan was to divide his force in half he would take Admiral Hipper, Z4 Richard Beitzen, Z29 and the destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. Lutzow and three destroyers would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. The three destroyers separated from Admiral Hipper to search for the convoy, which they found on the morning of 31 December. The destroyer HMS Obdurate spotted them in turn and closed to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a range of 8,000 meters 8,700 yd . Obdurate turned away to rejoin the convoy without sustaining any damage and the German ships did not pursue as they had been ordered to rejoin Hipper. The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble, which had been detached earlier from the convoy to search for stragglers, as they maneuvered to close with the convoy and the destroyers were ordered to sink her, while Hipper engaged the convoy escorts. This took some time in the poor visibility and Hipper was surprised in the meantime by the British covering force of the light cruisers Sheffield and Jamaica. After sinking Bramble, the German destroyers attempted to rejoin Hipper but had no idea that British cruisers were in the area. About this time Z29 lost contact with the other destroyers. The other two destroyers confused Sheffield with Hipper when they spotted each other at 4,000 meters 4,400 yd range and were surprised when Sheffield opened fire on Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt with every gun she possessed, sinking her with the loss of all hands. Z29 was one of the escorts for the light cruiser Koln and the damaged Admiral Hipper on 24 January 1943 as they began their voyage to Kiel. The destroyer then began a refit at Wesermunde. The ship completed working up in July and sailed to Norway on the 22nd, accompanied by the destroyer Z33. The two ships, with the addition of Z31 were assigned to the 4. Zerstorerflotille 4th Destroyer Flotilla upon their arrival. During Operation Zitonronella, the German raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September, they were tasked with fire support for the troops ashore. During the mission Z29 was hit four times by coastal artillery, killing three crewmen and wounding three others. The ship was one of the escorts for Scharnhorst during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape. Z29 had her boilers repaired at the beginning of 1944 and remained in Norwegian waters through the rest of the year. On 17 July the ship was strafed by aircraft fighters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, but only suffered superficial damage. Beginning in October, she escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 16 December Z29 and Z31 laid a minefield off Honningsvaag. A week later, she sailed from Laafjord for Wesermunde to begin a refit that replaced her forward gun with the twin gun turret and greatly augmented her anti aircraft armament. The war ended in May 1945, before her refit was completed, and the ship was decommissioned on the 7th. Z29 was allocated to the United States when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945. Due to her poor state of repair, the United States Navy declined to make use of the ship and she was scuttled at the entrance to the Skagerrak on 10 June 1946 with a load of chemical munitions aboard.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z29
"Z30 was one of eight Type 1936A destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1941, the ship was transferred to Norwegian waters in early 1942 where she remained for most of the rest of her career, escorting convoys and laying minefields. She played a minor role in the indecisive Battle of the Barents Sea at the end of the year and was damaged during the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September 1943. Z30 was crippled when she struck a mine in late 1944 and spent the rest of the war under repair. The ship was allocated to Great Britain after the war who used her to test the effects of underwater explosions. Upon their completion in 1948, Z30 was broken up for scrap. The Type 1936A destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936 class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.90 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,657 long tons 2,700 t at standard load and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . Z30 carried a maximum of 825 metric tons 812 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,950 nautical miles 5,460 km 3,390 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 11 officers and 321 sailors. The ship carried four 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in single mounts with gun shields, one forward of the superstructure and three aft. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and five 2 centimeter 0.8 in C 30 guns in single mounts. Z30 carried eight above water 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. She had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. During 19421943, Z30's anti aircraft armament was increased to ten each 3.7 cm and 2 cm guns. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. By the end of the war, her anti aircraft suite consisted of seven 3.7 cm and fourteen 2 cm weapons. Z30 was ordered from AG Weser Deschimag on 23 April 1938. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard as yard number W964 on 14 January 1940, launched on 12 August, and commissioned on 15 November 1941. While working up she accidentally collided with the German submarine U 216 on 14 January 1942. Beginning on 18 March, she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper from Brunsbuttel, Germany, to Trondheim, Norway, and then accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer from Trondheim to Narvik. Z30 took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rosselsprung, an attempt to intercept Convoy PQ 17 in July. Admiral Scheer and her sister Lutzow formed one group in Narvik with Z30 and four of her sisters while the battleship Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper composed another. While en route to the rendezvous at the Altafjord, Lutzow and three destroyers of Tirpitz's escort ran aground, forcing the entire group to abandon the operation. On 58 September Z30, her sister Z29, and the destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen laid a minefield in the Kara Strait between the island of Novaya Zemlya and Vaygach Island. Later that month, she participated in Operation Zarin, a minelaying mission off the coast of Novaya Zemlya from 24 to 28 September, together with Admiral Hipper, and her sisters Z23, Z28, and Z29. On 1315 October, Z30, her sister Z27, Z4 Richard Beitzen and the destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea that sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan. Three weeks later, the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November. They intercepted and sank the westbound Soviet oil tanker Donbass and the submarine chaser BO 78 on the 7th. On 30 December, Lutzow and Admiral Hipper, escorted by six destroyers, including Z30, left Narvik for Operation Regenbogen, an attack on Convoy JW 51B, which was reported by German intelligence to be lightly escorted. Vizeadmiral Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz's plan was to divide his force in half he would take Admiral Hipper and three destroyers north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. Lutzow, Z30 and the destroyers Z6 Theodor Riedel and Z31 would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. The Germans failed to press home their attack, only briefly engaging the convoy and damaging one merchantman. Z30 was one of the escorts for the light cruiser Koln and the damaged Admiral Hipper on 24 January 1943 as they began their voyage to Kiel, Germany, where the destroyer began a refit. She returned to Norwegian waters after her refit and conducted several minelaying missions between 19 and 28 June together with Z27. The ship took part in Operation Zitronella, the German raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September where she was hit by coastal artillery and slightly damaged. Z30 was one of the escorts for the battleship Scharnhorst during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape. The ship was transferred to southern Norway in 1944 and escorted convoys and laid minefields from 8 May. She began a refit at Swinemunde, Germany, on 31 August and conducted operations in the western Baltic and Skaggerak when it was completed. While escorting a convoy on 20 October, Z30 struck a mine off Oslofjord that crippled her. The explosion destroyed her stern compartment, knocked out the port turbine, jammed the starboard propeller shaft and caused extensive shock damage throughout the ship. Towed to Oslo, Norway, for repairs, they were not yet complete when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945 and she was decommissioned six days later. Z30 was turned over to the Royal Norwegian Navy for maintenance purposes on 15 July while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to the British in late 1945 and was towed to Rosyth, Scotland, on 6 February 1946. She was effectively unusable without extensive and expensive repairs so she was condemned to be used for evaluating the effects of underwater explosions on her hull. Z30 was towed to Loch Striven where the tests were conducted between May and September 1948. Three 500 kilogram 1,100 lb charges of torpex were detonated below her hull at various depths. Despite some damage to her hull plating, her welded hull was not significantly damaged during the tests. The ship was sold for scrap on 9 September and towed to their facility at Dalmuir to be demolished.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z30
"Z31 was a German Type 1936A Mob destroyer, which was completed in 1942 and served with the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. She spent much of the war in Arctic and Norwegian waters, taking part in the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942. She survived the war, and was passed on to the French Navy as a war prize, serving under the name Marceau until 1958. On 28 June 1939, orders for nine destroyers Z31Z39 of the new Type 1938B class were placed by Germany, with a further three destroyers of the class being ordered in July. They were ordered as a part of Plan Z, which was a German naval rearmament plan, involving building ten battleships, four aircraft carriers, twelve battlecruisers, three pocket battleships, five heavy cruisers, forty four light cruisers, sixty eight destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to be split into two battle fleets a Home Fleet , to tie down the British war fleet in the North Sea, and a Raiding Fleet , to wage war upon British convoys. The Type 1938B were relatively small destroyers compared with the preceding Type 1936 and 1936A ships, to be armed with four 127mm 5 in guns in two twin turrets, and designed for long range. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, however, orders for the Type 1938B destroyers were cancelled, with a reversion to a slightly modified version of the previous Type 1936A class, the Type 1936A Mob class. On 19 September 1939, four destroyers Z31Z34 were re ordered from the Deschimag consortium to be built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen on that day, with a further three ships Z37Z39 ordered from the Germaniawerft yard. Z31 was laid down on 1 September 1940 with the yard number 1001 , launched on 15 May 1941 and commissioned on 11 April 1942. Z31 was 127.0 metres 416 ft 8 in long overall and 121.9 metres 399 ft 11 in at the waterline, with a beam of 12.0 metres 39 ft 4 in and a draught of 3.924.62 metres 12 ft 10 in15 ft 2 in depending on displacement. Displacement was 2,645 tonnes 2,603 long tons standard and 3,655 tonnes 3,597 long tons full load. The ship's machinery consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high pressure superheated steam at 70 atm 1,029 psi 7,093 kPa and 450 C 842 F to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. The ship's rated power was 70,000 shaft horsepower 52,000 kW , giving a speed of 38.5 knots 71.3 km h 44.3 mph , while its range was 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The ship had a complement of 321 officers and ratings. The design main armament for the Type 1936A Mob class was, like the Type 1936A class on which it was based, five 15 cm 5.9in TbtsK C 36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Development of the twin turret was slow however, and Z31 like all the Type 1936A class , was completed with an additional single 15 cm gun replacing the unavailable twin turret, giving a total of four 15 cm guns. The forward gun was replaced by the intended twin turret in 1944, but the twin turret was replaced by a single 10.5 cm 4.1in SK L 45 naval gun after the twin turret was wrecked in battle in January 1945. The ship's anti aircraft armament consisted of two twin 3.7 cm SK C 30 anti aircraft guns later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns and nine 2 cm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 20 mm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts, while additional 3.7 cm guns were fitted in 1945, giving a final anti aircraft armament in German service of fourteen 3.7 cm and twelve 2 cm guns. Eight 53.3 cm 21 in torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to 60 mines could be carried. After commissioning, the ship underwent a lengthy work up process, which was common for German destroyers during the Second World War. Following Z31 being damaged in a collision with a schooner on 6 November 1941, she was transferred to an operational flotilla in Norwegian waters in December 1942. On 30 December 1942, Z31 left Altafjord in northern Norway along with the heavy cruisers Admiral Hipper and Lutzow and the destroyers Friedrich Eckoldt, Richard Beitzen, Theodor Riedel, Z29 and Z30 on Operation Regenbogen, an attempt to attack the Arctic convoy JW 51B. The German force encountered the convoy on the morning of 31 December, and in poor visibility, engaged the convoy's escort in the Battle of the Barents Sea. Hipper sank the British destroyer Achates and the minesweeper Bramble and damaged the destroyers Onslow and Obdurate, while Lutzow damaged the destroyer Obedient, but broke off the engagement after the British cruiser covering force of Sheffield and Jamaica damaged Hipper and sank Richard Beitzen. None of the 15 merchant ships in the convoy were damaged. On 56 February 1943, Z31, Theodor Riedel and the minelayer Brummer laid a minefield off Kildin Island, while on 1011 March the two destroyers escorted Lutzow from Kaafjord to Narvik. On 6 September 1943, Z31 set out from Altafjord as part of a fleet consisting of the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst and nine destroyers on Operation Zitronella, a raid on Allied controlled Spitzbergen. Z31 was hit eight times by shells from coastal artillery off Barentsburg on 8 September, with one man killed and a second wounded. In November, Z31 transferred to southern Norway, where she carried out patrol operations before laying defensive minefields in the entrance to the Skagerrak from 47 December. After that operation, Z31 began a refit at Wesermunde, which continued until August 1944, when she returned to Norway. She was damaged by strafing from British carrier based fighters during an attack on Tirpitz at Altafjord on 29 August. In October 1944, Z31 took part in escort operations as the Germans evacuated the 20th Mountain Army from northern Finland and Norway in response to the Soviet PetsamoKirkenes Offensive. The destroyer continued escort and patrol duties for the rest of the year, together with minelaying operations off Honningsvag with Z29 on 16 December and with Z33 on 27 December and off Hammerfest again with Z33 on 3 January 1945. On 25 January 1945, the German 4th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of Z31, Z34 and Z38 set out from Troms for the Baltic. On 28 January, the three destroyers were intercepted by the British cruisers Mauritius and Diadem in Sognefjord, north of Bergen. Z31 was hit seven times by the British ships, with her forward turret being wrecked and 55 men killed and a further 24 wounded. Z34 was also damaged. After escaping, Z31 put into Bergen for temporary repairs, with further work being carried out at Horten and Oslo before the ship reached the Baltic. From 22 March, Z31, working with Z34 and Lutzow, shelled advancing Soviet troops near Gotenhafen in West Prussia now Gdynia in Poland , while on 23 March she towed the hulk of the battleship Gneisenau to the entrance of Gotenhafen harbour, ready to be sunk as a blockship. Gneisenau was scuttled on 27 March . On 27 March, a 15 cm shell accidentally exploded in one of Z31's guns, killing four and wounding 18. Nevertheless, Z31 continued to support evacuation of German troops and civilians from Gotenhafen and Hela, until the ship was damaged by Soviet bombs, and withdrew westwards with Prinz Eugen and Lutzow on 8 April. Z31 was docked at Swinemunde now Swinoujscie for repair on 10 April, and was damaged again by Soviet air attack when on passage to Kiel on 27 April. She reached Brunsbuttel on 30 April, and remained there until the end of the war on 8 May. Following the end of the war, Z31 was transferred to Great Britain. She was to be given to France as part of Germany's war reparations, thus, following testing in August 1945, she was passed on to France, being transferred to the French Navy at Cherbourg on 2 February 1946, and commissioned as Marceau on 1 April. From 19481950, Marceau underwent a major refit, in which the forward 10.5 cm gun was replaced by a 15.0 cm gun, the ship's anti aircraft outfit changed to eight Bofors 40 mm guns and US radar was fitted. She was stationed in Toulon, and served out of it for several years. She visited Oran, Dakar and Bizerte regularly during exercises with the French fleet. She went into reserve in 1953, and on 1 February 1954 was laid up as a hulk Q103 . She was stricken on 2 January 1958 and sold for scrap later that year, being broken up in the early 1960s.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z31
"Z32 was a German Type 1936A Mob destroyer, which was completed in 1942 and which served with the 8th Destroyer Flotilla of the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. She fought in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay against HMS Glasgow and HMS Enterprise, alongside the German 8th Destroyer Flotilla and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. She mainly operated from German occupied French Atlantic ports, escorting blockade runners and U boats, and was sunk during the Battle of Ushant on 9 June 1944. On 28 June 1939, Nazi Germany placed orders for nine destroyers Z31Z39 of the new Type 1938B class. A further three destroyers of the class were ordered in July. The Type 1938B destroyers were relatively small, compared with the preceding Type 1936 and 1936A ships. They were to be armed with four 12.7 centimetres 5.0 in guns in two twin turrets, and were designed for long range. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, however, orders for the Type 1938B destroyers were cancelled Germany reverted to the Type 1936A Mob class, a slightly modified version of the previous Type 1936A class. On 9 September 1939, four destroyers Z31Z34 were re ordered from the Deschimag consortium, to be built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. A further three ships Z37Z39 were ordered from the Germaniawerft yard. Z32 was laid down on 1 November 1940 with a yard number of 1002 , launched on 15 August 1941 and commissioned on 15 September 1942. Z32 was 127.0 metres 416 ft 8 in in overall length and 121.9 m 399 ft 11 in in waterline length, with a beam of 12.0 m 39 ft 4 in and a draught of 3.924.62 m 12 ft 10 in15 ft 2 in , depending on displacement. Her displacement was 2,645 tonnes 2,603 long tons standard and 3,655 t 3,597 long tons full load. The ship's machinery consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high pressure superheated steam at 70 atm 1,029 psi 7,093 kPa and 450 C 842 F to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. Her rated power was 70,000 shaft horsepower 52,000 kW , giving the destroyer a speed of 38.5 knots 71.3 km h 44.3 mph . Her range was 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi at 19 kn 35 km h 22 mph . The ship had a complement of 321 officers and ratings. Z32's main armaments were five 15 cm 5.9in TbtsK C 36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Z32 was the first ship of her class to be completely fitted with the armament, as development of the twin turret had been slow. Her anti aircraft armament consisted of two twin 3.7 cm SK C 30 anti aircraft guns later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns and nine 2 cm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 2 cm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts. Eight 53.3 cm 21 in torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to sixty mines could be carried. After commissioning and work up, Z32 joined the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, which was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin from 58 March 1943. Despite being fired upon off the coast of Dover by British artillery, the Flotilla reached Bordeaux unscathed on 8 March. On 28 March, Z32 was one of four destroyers that formed the distant escort for the Italian blockade runner Himalaya. They set out from Bordeaux for the Far East, with nine torpedo boats providing a close escort, but the force turned back when it was spotted by British air reconnaissance. On 30 March, Z32, together with the destroyers Z23, Z24 and Z37, set out to meet the incoming blockade runner Pietro Orseolo. Heavy British air attacks were repelled, but Pietro Orseolo was damaged by a torpedo from the American submarine Shad, before reaching safety in the Gironde estuary on 2 April. On 9 April, Z32 provided cover for the Himalaya during her breakout attempt, but they were foiled once again by British air attacks. The Z32's other operations included covering German U boats departing from and returning to their French bases. On 24 December 1943, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of six destroyers including Z32, and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, comprising six torpedo boats, set out to meet the blockade runner Osorno, meeting her on 25 December. They managed to escort Osorno to the Gironde despite heavy air attacks, but Orsono struck a submerged wreck and had to be beached to save her cargo. On 26 December, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla again including Z32 and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set out again to meet another inbound blockade runner, Alsterufer. Unknown to the Germans, Alsterufer was attacked on 27 December by a B 24 Liberator bomber of No. 311 Czechoslovak Squadron RAF, set on fire and abandoned by her crew. At about midday on 28 December, the British cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, on patrol in the Bay of Biscay to intercept blockade runners, encountered the German destroyers and torpedo boats, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. The German forces attempted a pincer manoeuvre, but this was prevented by the heavy seas. The destroyer Z27 and the torpedo boats T25 and T27 were sunk. Z33 fired six torpedoes at the British cruisers, all of which missed. On 30 January 1944, as Z32 was carrying out exercises with Z23 and Z37 in the south of the Bay of Biscay, she collided with Z37. Z32 sustained damage to her degaussing system and suffered a fire on her forecastle, caused by loose ready use anti aircraft ammunition. Meanwhile, one of Z37's torpedoes exploded, starting a fire and causing flooding. Z32 was under repair until 2 May. Z37 considered to be beyond economical repair, and was disarmed. Z32 was damaged again on 5 May after running aground, and underwent repairs for another month. On 6 June 1944, following the Normandy landings, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of the destroyers Z32, Z24, ZH1 and the torpedo boat T24, set off for Brest for operations against the invasion fleet. They were attacked by British aircraft during their journey, with Z32 damaged by British rockets. On 8 and 9 June, the four ships set out from Brest for Cherbourg, but were intercepted by eight Allied destroyers in the Battle of Ushant. ZH1 was sunk by torpedoes from the British destroyer Ashanti, while Z32 was pursued by the Canadian destroyers Haida and Huron. She ran aground and was wrecked on the Ile de Batz. The other two German ships escaped back to Cherbourg, while the British destroyer Tartar was damaged.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z32
"Z33 was a Type 1936A Mob destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1943, the ship was damaged during the raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September and spent all of 1944 in Norwegian waters. She was damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship Tirpitz in July. Z33 escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October. She ran aground in early 1945 as she was sailing for the Baltic and was badly damaged. While the ship was being towed to port for repairs, she and her escorts were attacked by Allied fighter bombers. Z33 finally reached the Baltic in early April, but was reduced to reserve for lack of fuel. The ship was transferred to Cuxhaven and decommissioned shortly before the end of the war. Z33 was allocated to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over at the beginning of 1946. Renamed Provornyy, the ship subsequently served with the Soviet Navy. She became a training ship in 1954 before she was converted to an accommodation ship the following year. Provornyy was badly damaged by a fire in 1960 and was scrapped in 1962. The Type 1936A Mob destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. The class had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.9 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,657 long tons 2,700 t at standard load and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , and their maximum speed was 36.1 knots 66.9 km h 41.5 mph . The Type 1936A Mob destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The crew of the ships numbered 1115 officers and 30521 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 1936A Mob ships were armed with five 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in a twin gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure. Their anti aircraft armament varied and Z33's consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in Flak M42 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and ten 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 38 guns in two quadruple and two single mounts. The ships carried eight 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. A S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge as well as FuMB 3 Bali, FuMB 6 Palau, FuMB 26 Tunis, and FuMB 31 radar detectors. A FuMB 4 Sumatra radar detector was added after completion and a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. In early April 1945, one 15 cm gun was transferred to her sister Z34 to replace a damaged weapon. About that same time her anti aircraft guns were removed. When the destroyer was ordered to the German Bight later that month, they were replaced by weapons taken from the wreck of the heavy cruiser Lutzow. By the end of the war, Z33's anti aircraft suite consisted of ten 3.7 cm gun in five twin mounts and a dozen 2 cm guns in one quadruple, two twin and four single mounts. Z33 was first ordered from Seebeckwerft yard number 665 as a Type 1938B destroyer on 28 June 1939, but the Kriegsmarine cancelled the order in September 1939, re ordering the ship from AG Weser Deschimag yard number W1003 as a Type 1936A Mob destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard on 22 December 1940 and launched on 15 September 1941. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z33 was not commissioned until 6 February 1943. The ship sailed to Norway shortly after she finished working up on 22 July. She took part in Operation Zitronella, the German raid on the island of Spitsbergen in September where she was hit by coastal artillery 33 times, killing 3 crewmen and wounding 25. Z33 was one of the escorts for the battleship Scharnhorst during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape. She remained in Norwegian waters through 1944. On 17 July 1944 Z33 was strafed by Vought F4U Corsair fighters of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during Operation Mascot, an attack on the battleship Tirpitz, but only suffered superficial damage. Beginning in October, the ship escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 27 December Z33 laid a minefield off Honningsvaag together with her sister Z31. The two ships laid another minefield off Hammerfest on 3 January 1945. Z33 departed for Germany on 5 February, but ran aground in Brufjord two days later. The impact severely damaged her port propeller shaft and its propeller, knocked out both turbines, and caused flooding. While under tow to Trondheim she was attacked by Allied Bristol Beaufighter fighter bombers two days later while anchored in Frde Fjord. The destroyer was further damaged during the attack, but she and her escorts shot down seven Beaufighters, which later became known by the squadrons involved as the Black Friday airstrike for the heavy casualties that they suffered. Once repairs were completed she sailed for Swinemunde on 26 March and arrived there on 2 April. Due to Germany's shortage of fuel the ship was laid up and saw no further combat. All of her anti aircraft guns were removed shortly after her arrival. Before Z33 departed Swinemunde on 27 April to be decommissioned at Cuxhaven, her anti aircraft weapons were replaced by guns taken from the wreck of Lutzow. After the war Z33 sailed to Wilhelmshaven and was overhauled to keep her seaworthy while the Allies decided how to divide the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves as war reparations. The ship was allotted to the Soviet Union in late 1945 and turned over on 2 January 1946 before departing for Liepaja, Latvia. She was renamed Provornyy , Nimble and assigned to the Red Banner Baltic Fleet. She briefly became a training ship on 30 November 1954 before was reclassified as an accommodation ship on 22 April 1955. During 1960, Provornyy was badly damaged by a fire and sank at her moorings. She was refloated two years later and then scrapped.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z33
"Z34 was a Type 1936A Mob destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in 1943, the ship spent all of 1944 in the Norwegian waters and was twice damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship Tirpitz. She escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October. Z34 was transferred to the Baltic with two of her sister ships at the beginning of 1945 and participated in the Action of 28 January 1945 when they were intercepted off the Norwegian coast by a pair of British light cruisers. The ship was only lightly damaged during the battle and all three destroyers were able to disengage. Over the next several months, she escorted evacuation convoys and German cruisers as they bombarded Soviet positions. She also attacked Soviet troops with her own guns. Z34 was badly damaged by a Soviet torpedo in mid April and had to be towed to port for emergency repairs. They sufficed to allow her to take a group of refugees and cut off troops to Denmark in early May. The ship was surrendered to the Allies in Germany and was allocated to the United States when they divided up the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine. Still not fully repaired from the torpedo hit in 1945, the ship was scuttled in early 1946. The Type 1936A Mob destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. The class had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.9 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,657 long tons 2,700 t at standard load and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , and their maximum speed was 36.1 knots 66.9 km h 41.5 mph . The Type 1936A Mob destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The crew of the ships numbered 1115 officers and 30521 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 1936A Mob ships were armed with five 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in a twin gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure.

The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge as well as a FuMB 34 radar detector. A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 19441945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. Before 31 March 1945, a pair of 8.6 cm 3.4 in RaG anti aircraft rocket launchers were fitted. By the end of the war, Z34's light anti aircraft gun armament consisted of one to three 4 cm 1.6 in , six 3.7 cm and sixteen 2 cm guns. Z34 was first ordered from Seebeckwerft yard number 666 as a Type 1938B destroyer on 28 June 1939, but the Kriegsmarine cancelled the order in September 1939, re ordering the ship from AG Weser Deschimag yard number W1004 as a Type 1936A Mob destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard on 14 January 1941 and launched on 15 May 1942. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z34 was not commissioned until 5 June 1943. The ship sailed to Norway shortly after she finished working up on 1 November. The following month, she was one of the escorts for the battleship Scharnhorst during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and thus did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape. Z34 remained in the Arctic throughout 1944 to defend the damaged battleship Tirpitz. Z34 was damaged during British airstrikes on 17 July and 29 August her crew helped to put out a fire aboard the oil tanker SS C. A. Larsen during the latter attack. Beginning in October, the ship escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 1 December, she towed a damaged troopship into Hammerfest and then continued on to Troms where she began a refit on the 11th. On 22 January 1945, Z31, Z34 and Z38, laid minefields in Magerya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January the three destroyers departed Troms for the Baltic. Three days later they were intercepted by a squadron of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius off the Sognefjord. During the ensuing Action of 28 January, Z31 was heavily damaged and the lightly damaged Z34 made several fruitless torpedo attacks on the cruisers to cover Z31's withdrawal. Laying smoke as they withdrew, the faster destroyers were able to outpace the cruisers and take shelter in Aspofjord protected by German coastal artillery. Z34 was only lightly damaged during the engagement and ferried 200 artillerymen from Kiel to Gotenhafen on 3 February. A week later she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer as the latter bombarded Soviet positions near Frauenburg in support of the 4th Army. Over the next several months, Z34 evacuated refugees from Kolberg, escorted the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer, Lutzow, and Prinz Eugen during their bombardment missions, and bombarded Dievenov and Tolkemit herself. During the former action, the ship was credited with the destruction of twelve tanks and four anti tank guns. She was lightly damaged by Soviet aircraft on 29 March. Two days later, Z34 was the first German ship to engage aircraft with her rockets. In early April, the ship escorted the ocean liners Deutschland and Pretoria as they carried 17,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark. Z34 began a brief refit on 4 April at Swinemunde and bombarded Soviet positions near Grossendorf on the 10th. During a duel with a Soviet coastal artillery battery at Oxhoft, a 15 cm shell prematurely detonated in the barrel and destroyed the gun. It was replaced by a weapon taken from the decommissioned Z33. While returning to Hela after another escort mission, the ship was attacked by two Soviet motor torpedo boats on the night of 15 16 April. She evaded one torpedo, but was struck by another. The hit flooded the aft turbine room, disabled both turbines, knocked out all power, and gave the destroyer a list to port. While drifting the next day, Z34 was attacked by Soviet aircraft and an anti aircraft rocket detonated on deck, killing eight crewmen and wounding fourteen. She was towed into Swinemunde by the torpedo boat T36 and the minesweeper M204 where she received emergency repairs. The ship also had her light anti aircraft armament augmented by weapons taken from the wreck of Lutzow. On 4 May she arrived at Copenhagen with a full load of refugees and was decommissioned at Kiel on the 10th. Z34 was allocated to the United States when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945. Due to her poor state of repair, the United States Navy declined to make use of the ship and she was scuttled in the Skaggerak on 26 March 1946 with a load of chemical munitions aboard.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z34
"Z35 was the lead ship of her class of destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in late 1943, the ship spent the war in the Baltic Sea, escorting German ships, laying minefields, and bombarding Soviet forces. On 12 December 1944, a navigational error caused her to enter a German minefield as she was preparing to lay another minefield in the Gulf of Finland off the Estonian coast. Z35 struck one or more mines and sank with the loss of all but 70 crewmen. The wreck was discovered and surveyed in 1994. The Type 1936B design retained the hull design of the Type 1936A, but reverted to the lighter main armament of the Type 1936 to reduce topweight and improve seakeeping. The ships had an overall length of 127 metres 416 ft 8 in and was 121.9 metres 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 metres 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draught of 4.32 metres 14 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,519 long tons 2,559 t at standard load and 3,542 long tons 3,599 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . The ships carried a maximum of 835 tonnes 822 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,600 nautical miles 4,800 km 3,000 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Their crew consisted of 1115 officers and 30520 sailors. The Type 1936B ships carried five 12.7 centimetre 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were designated No. 1 to 5 from front to rear. Their anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimetre 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and fifteen 2 centimetre 0.8 in C 38 guns in three quadruple and three single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimetre 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 7476 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and an S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ships were equipped with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. Z35 was originally ordered as a Type 1938B destroyer from AG Weser Deschimag on 28 June 1939, but the contract was cancelled when the Type 1938B design was abandoned, and the ship was reordered as a Type 1936A Mob destroyer. That was changed to a Type 1936B on 17 February 1941. She was laid down as yard number W1005 on 6 June at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard, launched on 2 October 1942 and commissioned on 22 September 1943 under the command of Korvettenkapitan Lieutenant Commander Niels Batge. After working up Z35 was assigned to the 6. Zerstorerflotille 6th Destroyer Flotilla in February 1944. The four destroyers and single torpedo boat of the flotilla were transferred to the Gulf of Finland to support minelaying operations there, Z35 arriving at Reval, Estonia, on 13 February. The flotilla was initially tasked to escort convoys between Libau, Latvia, and Reval, but laid its first minefield in Narva Bay on 12 March while bombarding Soviet positions on the eastern shore of the bay. They were primarily tasked as minelayers through July, including reinforcing the existing minefields in the Gulf of Finland in April. In preparation for Operation Tanne West, the occupation of the Aland Islands in case of Finnish surrender, the flotilla escorted the heavy cruiser Lutzow to the island of Uto on 28 June, but the operation was canceled and the ships returned to port. On 30 July and 1 August Z35 and three other destroyers of the flotilla sailed into the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland. On 5 August, they escorted Prinz Eugen as she engaged targets on the island of Osel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 1920 August. That last day Z35 damaged one of her propellers on a rock and had to return to Gotenhafen for repairs. In September the flotilla covered the convoys evacuating Finland and then Reval. On 10 October the flotilla escorted the heavy cruisers Lutzow and Prinz Eugen as they resumed their shore bombardment missions and bombarded targets themselves, attacking Soviet positions at Memel, Libau, and Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, through the 24th. On 23 October a shell exploded prematurely in the barrel of No. 3 gun, wounding one man, and blowing the barrel and breech overboard. The following day Z35 was struck by splinters during a Soviet air attack. The following month, the flotilla and the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Prinz Eugen shelled Soviet positions during the evacuation of Sworbe between 20 and 24 November. By mid December, Z35 was the flagship of Kapitan zur See Captain Friedrich Kothe, commander of the 6. Zerstorerflotille, which now consisted of his flagship, her sister ships Z36 and Z43, and the large torpedo boats T23 and T28, was tasked to lay a new minefield between the Estonian coast and an existing minefield slightly further out to sea. T23 was to escort the other ships and the destroyers were laden with 68 mines each. The mission was postponed to the night of 11 12 December because of bad weather and the flotilla sailed on the morning of the 11th. The weather gradually worsened over the course of the day and the spray and rain made navigation difficult. Having sailed a bit too far north, Z35 and Z36 blundered into the Nashorn Rhinoceros minefield that was only 2.5 nautical miles 4.6 km 2.9 mi north of the intended position of the new minefield. After a faint explosion was heard at about 01 52, Kothe radioed for T23 to close on Z35. Almost immediately afterwards, a mine struck the port side of the ship, abreast No. 4 gun, knocking out the port turbine and flooding one compartment. Z35 was not in any danger of sinking by 02 00 when Z36 struck a mine and sank very quickly with the loss of all hands. Shortly afterwards, Z35 suffered an explosion amidships, possibly from a boiler explosion that also detonated some ammunition. The crew abandoned ship before she sank, but only about 70 men were rescued by the Soviets. The wreck was surveyed by the Finnish Ministry of the Environment in 1994 in 50 metres 160 ft of water, at 5938.2N 2420E 59.6367N 24.333E 59.6367 24.333Coordinates 5938.2N 2420E 59.6367N 24.333E 59.6367 24.333.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z35

On 5 August, they escorted the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen as she engaged targets on the island of Osel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 1920 August. Z36 and the destroyer Z28 escorted the troopship MV Monte Rosa, laden with refugees, from Baltischport, Estonia, to Gotenhafen, Germany, on 16 September.

"Z37 was a Type 1936A Mob destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine during World War II. Completed in 1942, the ship spent most of her brief career deployed in France. She participated in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of 1943 before she was accidentally rammed by the destroyer Z32 in early 1944. Towed back to port, the Kriegsmarine German Navy decided that Z37 was too badly damaged to repair and disarmed her hulk. Decommissioned later that year, she was scuttled by her crew before being scrapped by the French in 1949. The Type 1936A Mob destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of 127 meters 416 ft 8 in and were 121.9 meters 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of 12 meters 39 ft 4 in and a maximum draft of 4.62 meters 15 ft 2 in . They displaced 2,657 long tons 2,700 t at standard load and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph , but their maximum was 35.5 knots 65.7 km h 40.9 mph . The Type 1936A Mob class destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi at a speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . The crew of the ships numbered 1115 officers and 30521 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 1936A Mob ships were armed with five 15 centimeter 5.9 in TbtsK C 36 guns in a twin gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure. Their anti aircraft armament varied and Z37's consisted of four 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in Flak M42 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and seven 2 centimeter 0.79 in C 38 guns in one quadruple and three single mounts. The ships carried eight 53.3 centimeter 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat was fitted to detect submarines. A S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. Z37 was equipped with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge. Another quadruple 2 cm mount replaced the forward single 2 cm gun sometime after early 1943. The ship was fitted with a FuMB Metox radar detector after commissioning. Z37 was first ordered from Oderwerke Stettin as a Type 1938B destroyer on 26 June 1939, but the German Navy cancelled the order in September 1939, re ordering the ship as yard number G627 from Germaniawerft as a Type 1936A Mob destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard on 2 January 1940 and launched on 24 February 1941. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z37 was not commissioned until 16 July 1942. On 23 January 1943 Z37 set out as part of the escort for the battleship Scharnhorst and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from the Baltic sea to Norway, but the operation was cancelled when the force was spotted by British aircraft. On 5 March 1943, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla Z23, Z24, Z32 and Z37 was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the Flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre on 6 March, damaging her starboard propeller, and was under repair until 18 March. On 28 March, Z37 was one of four destroyers that formed the distant escort for the Italian blockade runner Himalaya setting out from Bordeaux for the Far East, with 9 torpedo boats providing a close escort, but the force turned back when spotted by British air reconnaissance. On 30 March, Z37, together with the destroyers Z23, Z24 and Z32, set out to meet the incoming blockade runner Pietro Orseolo. Heavy British air attacks were repelled, but Pietro Orseolo was damaged by a torpedo from the American submarine Shad before reaching safety in the Gironde estuary on 2 April. On 9 April, Z37 set out on another attempt to cover the break out of Himalaya, but again this was foiled by British air attacks. On 24 December 1943, six destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla Z37, Z23, Z24, Z27 and ZH1 and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla of six torpedo boats set out to meet the blockade runner Osorno, meeting her on 25 December. They managed to escort Osorno to the Gironde despite heavy air attack, but Orsono struck a submerged wreck and had to be beached to save her cargo. On 26 December, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, again including Z37 but without ZH1 and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set out again to meet another inbound blockade runner, Alsterufer. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Alsterufer was attacked and set on fire by a B 24 Liberator bomber of No. 311 Czechoslovak Squadron RAF on 27 December and was abandoned by her crew. At about midday on 28 December, the British cruisers Glasgow and Enterprise, on patrol in the Bay of Biscay to intercept blockade runners, encountered the German destroyers and torpedo boats, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. Heavy seas prevented the German force from using its theoretical advantages in speed and firepower, with the destroyer Z27 and the torpedo boats T25 and T27 sunk. Z37 fired six torpedoes against the British cruisers, all of which missed. On 30 January 1944, Z37 was carrying out exercises in the south of the Bay of Biscay with Z23 and Z32 when she collided with Z32. One of Z37's torpedoes exploded, starting a fire which set off some of her anti aircraft ammunition and caused extensive flooding. She was towed back to Bordeaux, but the damage was considered too severe for repair, and her guns were removed to strengthen the shore defences of the Gironde estuary, with her crew being deployed as ground troops. She was decommissioned on 24 August and then scuttled. Her wreck was broken up in 1949.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z37
"Z38 was a Type 1936A Mob destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in 1941, and completed two years later. Her anti aircraft armament was modified heavily under Project Barbara. She served with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla her entire time under German service, and spent much of her life escorting task forces, patrolling, laying mines, and bombarding land forces. She served in the Baltic briefly in 1943, before being reassigned to the Arctic area around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and then serving in the Baltic again in 1945. After the war, she was taken by the Royal Navy, renamed Nonsuch, the sixth ship of her name. She was used for extensive machinery trials, before being used to test a 500 kilogram 1,100 lb charge, which broke her keel and flooded her. She was too damaged to refloat, and instead sold to Arnott Young Co., on 8 November 1949, to be scrapped. Z38 was 121.9 metres 400 ft long at the waterline and 127 metres 417 ft long overall, had a beam of 12 metres 39 ft , a freeboard of 6.6 metres 22 ft , and a draft of 4 metres 13 ft . She had a displacement of 3,083 long tons 3,132 t at standard load, and 3,691 long tons 3,750 t at full load. She had a complement of 332. She had 15 watertight compartments, and carried 825 tonnes 812 long tons 909 short tons of oil. Before her Project Barbara modifications, Z38 was armed with a twin 15 centimetre 5.9 in L 48 gun in a turret forward 200 rounds of ammunition , three single 15 cm 5.9 in L 48 guns in a gunhouse on her aft 600 rounds , ten 2 cm 0.8 in 20,000 rounds , four 3.7 cm 1.5 in anti aircraft guns 8,000 rounds , two quadruple 53.3 cm 21 in torpedo tubes, and 60 mines. After her modifications, she carried sixteen 2 cm guns and six 3.7 cm guns, and the rest of her armament was unchanged. Her propulsion system consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high pressure superheated steam at 70 atm 1,029 psi 7,093 kPa and 450 C 842 F to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. These gave the ship a rated power of 70,000 PS 51,000 kW 69,000 shp , and a top speed of 38.5 knots 71.3 km h 44.3 mph . She had a range of 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi , at her cruising speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Z38 was fitted with a FuMO 21 radar on her bridge, and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were placed around the searchlight platform on her foremast. She had a degaussing coil around her forecastle. Z38 was ordered on 19 September 1939 was laid down by Germaniawerft in Yard G628 in Kiel in 1941 was launched on 5 August 1941, and was commissioned on 20 March 1943. Z38 was immediately assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. In August 1943 Z38 served as a practice torpedo retrieval boat for the training cruisers Nurnberg and Emden. On 24 September Z38 travelled from Sassnitz to Trelleborg, to escort Lutzow during Operation Hermelin, alongside German destroyers Z5 Paul Jacobi, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, and Z27. On 22 October Z38 left Swinemunde for Kaafjord. On 25 December, a task force, under the command of Rear Admiral Erich Bey, made up of the German battleship Scharnhorst, and destroyers Z29, Z30, Z33, Z34, and Z38, were ordered to intercept Convoy JW.55A, which was made up of 19 ships. On 26 December Bey formed a patrol line using his destroyers. After ordering the destroyers back to base, Scharnhorst was located by British cruisers, who opened fire upon her. During the ensuing Battle of North Cape, Scharnhorst was sunk by the British fleet, including the British battleship Duke of York. From 30 to 31 May 1944 Z29, Z33, Z34, and Z38 formed a patrol line between Bear Island and the North Cape. Between 30 June and 1 July Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38, sortied to Bear Island. On 31 July German battleship Tirpitz, Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 sailed into the Arctic Ocean from Altafjord, for exercises. From 21 to 31 October Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38, covered the evacuation of the Mountain Corps Norway unit, from around Murmansk to Norway. From 6 to 17 November Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 covered German forces retreating from Tanafjord. On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38, laid mines in Magerya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Troms, making for the Baltic. On 28 January while off the Sognefjord the three destroyers were intercepted by a squadron of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38's funnels caught fire, splitting a boiler tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, and made for Kiel alongside Z34. Once there Z38 received 200 coastal artillerymen, to be taken to Gotenhafen. From 16 to 20 February Z34, Z38, T5, and T6 escorted the passenger liner Hamburg to Sassnitz. On 22 February Z38 escorted the German steamer Deutschland to Sassnitz. On 18 and 19 February Z38, alongside German cruiser Admiral Scheer, destroyer Z43, and minelayers T28 and T35, bombarded Soviet 39th Army positions, near Peyse and Gross Heydekrug, on the south coast of Samland. On 23 February Z38, Z43, and T28 bombarded these locations again. At one point during this, while between Konigsberg and Fischhausen, Z38 and T8 became icebound, and were freed by tugs. From 4 to 6 March Z38 bombarded Soviet armour and positions near Wollin, before taking refugees from Pillau to Gotenhafen. On 7 March Z35, Z38, and T28 escorted the steamship Pretoria to Copenhagen. On 13 March after returning to Gotenhafen Z38 bombarded Groendorf. For the rest of March Z38 was controlled by the Wehrmacht German army , rather than the Kriegsmarine. On 4 April her upper deck was damaged in an air raid. On 5 April Z38 became involved in a battle off Oxhofter Kampe. On 9 April Z38 escorted German cruisers Lutzow and Prinz Eugen from the Bay of Danzig to Swinemunde. From 28 April to 4 May Z38 helped defend the Dievenow channel of the Oder river. On 3 May Z38 and Z39 escorted the battleship Schlesien, which had hit a mine near Greifswalder Oie, to Swinemunde. On 4 May Z38 picked up refugees from Swinemunde, and made way for Copenhagen. On the same day, Z38 and T33 rescued the crew of the training ship Hektor, which had been heavily damaged in an air raid. On 7 May Z38 returned to Swinemunde and transported more refugees to Copenhagen. On 8 May Z6, Z10, Z14, Z20, Z25, Z38, Z39, T17, T19, T23, T28, and T33 set sail from Hela to Glucksburg, with 20,000 soldiers and civilians, arriving on May 9. On 9 May Z38 arrived at Kiel, after delivering her War Diary to the commanding officer's house off of Flensburg Forde. On 8 May Z38 was decommissioned. At some point after her decommissioning, Z38 was sailed by a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, and then, on 6 July 1945 Z38 sailed for Portsmouth, to be used as a trial vessel. Her German crew remained on board until 22 September 1946. While in British service, Z38 was renamed Nonsuch, the eleventh of her name, and used for testing purposes. Z38 was originally given the pennant number R40, but this was later changed to D107. After arriving in England, Z38 was used for various trials and evaluations in the Firth of Clyde, before being laid up in the Portchester creek. In October 1946 it was decided that Z38 was to be commissioned for extensive machinery trials, at the same time as being used as an air target ship under the Commander in Chief, Rosyth. In January 1947 Z38 was at full complement, and expected to enter service in June of the same year, in order to relieve HMS Fernie as an air target ship. In September 1948 Z38 was scheduled to be paid off into a reserve fleet, after her trials were finished in mid October. In December of that year, it was decided that Z38 would be scrapped, after showing off her auxiliary machinery to British shipbuilders, and removing certain equipment. However, in March 1949 Z38 was instead used for ship target trials, replacing Kimberley. After this decision was made, Z38 was disarmed and then towed to Loch Striven. In October 1949, Z38 was placed over a 500 kilogram 1,100 lb charge, which was then detonated. The explosion threw up a plume of water that was 250 feet 76 m high, and broke her keel approximately 1.6 seconds after the explosion. Her second boiler room flooded almost immediately, and the other two gradually filled with water. Z38 was then beached, and after inspection shown to be too damaged to refloat, and so it was decided that Z38 was to be handed over directly to shipbreakers while still beached. On 8 November 1949 Z38 was sold to Arnott Young Co Ltd for scrapping. By August 1950, the shipbreakers had removed the damaged section, and refloated her after end. The after end was taken to the breakers yard in Dalmuir for further inspection, but the fore end was broken up as it was laid on the beach.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z38
"The Z39 was a Type 1936A Mob destroyer built for Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in August 1940 and completed three years later. Her anti aircraft armament was increased extensively during the war. She served with the 6th Destroyer Flotilla her entire German career, which she spent escorting transports in the Baltic Sea, laying mines, and bombarding land forces. She served with a total of three different countries from 1943 to 1945 with the Kriegsmarine as Z39, from 1945 to 1947 with the US Navy as DD 939, and from 1948 to 1964 with the French Navy as Q 128. Over her German career she laid numerous barrages of mines in the Baltic Sea, and bombarded Soviet forces several times. In the last months of the war, Z39 helped escort steamships, which were evacuating German soldiers and civilians from Eastern Europe to Denmark. She was damaged twice, once from Soviet planes, while in Paldiski, and the other time from British planes, while in Kiel. At the end of the war, she was transferred to the United States Navy, where she was experimented upon to test her equipment, especially her high pressure steam propulsion plant. After the US Navy deemed her obsolete, she was transferred to the French Navy, where she was cannibalized for parts, and made into a pontoon for minesweepers. During World War Two, destroyers served three basic functions first, to act as screening ships to defend their fleets from enemy fleets, second, to attack the screening ships of enemy fleets, and third, to defend their fleet from submarines. How the destroyers were actually used varied upon the country. Germany abandoned the third function almost entirely, which showed in German destroyers' lack of strong anti submarine armament, preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re fitted as minelayers. The role of the destroyer began to vary much more heavily as WW2 progressed where the British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes, and sinking submarines, the German destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats. After the end of World War One, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, which put heavy limits both upon the size and displacement of warships that Germany could possess. During the Interbellum, the period between the first and second world wars, almost all warship categories experienced a large growth in the average size of their ships, and the size of their armaments. As a result of the treaty, Germany felt that it could not compete with the ships of the Allied navies, and therefore began to ignore the treaties, at first covertly, but later openly after Hitler publicly denounced them. All German ships of the time had their displacements purposefully understated, so as to have their official sizes comply with the treaty. At first, these changes were made with the goal of being able to match or exceed the French and Polish destroyers, but later on, it was required that these destroyers be able to match British destroyers, a much harder goal. Due to the comparatively small number of German shipyards, compared to the British or French, Germany adopted a policy of overarming their destroyers, so that they bore similar armament to French and Polish light cruisers, to compensate for their low numbers. Several negative effects came with this however, such as making them slower and overweight. Although the German heavy destroyers matched British light cruisers in armament, they were much less seaworthy, and had far worse facilities for control and use of their guns. Plan Z was a German naval re armament plan, started in 1939, involving building ten battleships, four aircraft carriers, twelve battlecruisers, three pocket battleships, five heavy cruisers, forty four light cruisers, sixty eight destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to be split into two battle fleets a Home Fleet , to tie down the British war fleet in the North Sea, and a Raiding Fleet , to wage war upon British convoys. Erich Raeder, the Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine, was assured by Hitler that war would not start until at least 1945. Raeder had wanted the deadline for Plan Z to be finished to be 1948, but Hitler lowered it to 1945. World War Two actually started in 1939, meaning that very few of Germany's heavy ships were finished in time for the start of the war. Germany's main naval opponents, France and England, had together compared to the number Germany had upon entry, in parentheses 22 battleships 2 , 7 carriers 0 , 22 heavy cruisers 4 , 61 light cruisers 6 , 255 destroyers 34 , 135 submarines 57, of which less than half could actually serve in the Atlantic or North Sea . Due to the severe advantage their enemies had, Raeder remarked that the Kriegsmarine could not hope to win, and thus the only course for them was to die valiantly . Z39 was 121.9 metres 400 ft long at the waterline and 127 metres 417 ft long overall, had a beam of 12 metres 39 ft , and a draught of 4 metres 13 ft . She had a displacement of 2,519 tonnes 2,479 long tons 2,777 short tons at standard load, and 3,691 tonnes 3,633 long tons 4,069 short tons at full load. She had a complement of 332. Before her Barbara Project modifications, she was armed with seven 2 cm 0.8 in anti aircraft guns, two twin 3.7 cm 1.5 in anti aircraft guns, a twin 15 centimetre 5.9 in L 48 gun on a turret forward, two single 15 centimetre 5.9 in L 48 guns in a gunhouse aft, two quadruple 53.3 cm 21 in torpedo tubes, and carried 60 mines. She had the Greek coat of arms on either side of her 15 centimetre 6 in twin turret. After the modifications, she carried eighteen 2 cm guns, fourteen 3.7 cm guns, and the rest of her armament remained unchanged. Her propulsion system consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high pressure superheated steam at 70 atm 1,029 psi 7,093 kPa and 450 C 842 F to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. These gave the ship a rated power of 70,000 shaft horsepower 52,000 kW , and a top speed of 38.5 knots 71.3 km h 44.3 mph . She had a range of 2,239 nautical miles 4,147 km 2,577 mi , at her cruising speed of 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Z39's sensor suite included a FuMO 21 radar, which was placed on the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast searchlights. She also had several other radars and radar detectors, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentweil K. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector. Z39 was ordered on 26 June 1939, laid down by Germaniawerft in Yard G629 in Kiel on 15 August 1940, launched on 2 December 1941, and was commissioned on 21 August 1943. Her commissioning had been delayed by lengthy construction times, and Z39 was not fully operational until 7 January 1944. These construction issues were due to multiple reasons, such as the small number of German shipyards, which forced the Kriegsmarine to choose priorities, the inexperienced naval engineers, and the lack of workers. At some point between her launching and commissioning, she was modified under Project Barbara, with the addition of three pairs of 3.7 cm 1.5 in anti aircraft AA guns added, one pair forward of her bridge, one pair abreast after her funnel, and one pair abreast forward of her funnel. She had one pair of single 3.7 cm 1.5 in guns added on to her after funnel platform. She had a pair of twin 2 cm 0.8 in guns added to her bridge wings. She had a pair of quadruple 2 cm 0.8 in guns and a pair of single 2 cm 0.8 in guns added to an extended deckhouse in her No. 3 gun position. After these changes, she began minelaying operations in the Skagerrak, and the Kattegat, until March, when she was transferred to Reval off the Gulf of Finland. After this move, she served in the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, alongside German destroyers Z25, Z28, and Z35. Between 12 and 13 February Z39 laid mines in the Dorothea A barrage, alongside two other destroyers and three minelayers. On 10 March, she took part in minelaying operations along with two other destroyers. Between 11 and 12 March, she bombarded Soviet forces near Narva Joesuu. From 13 March to 22 April, she took part in six different minelaying operations. One such operation lasted from 13 to 14 April, in which Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers laid the Seeigel 6b mine barrage south of Suur Tyarsaari. From 16 to 17 April, Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers laid the Seeigel 3b barrage off of Vigrund Island in Narva Bay. A smokescreen was laid during the operation in order to prevent the ships from being shelled by Soviet coastal artillery. An operation from 21 to 22 April, involving Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers was cancelled midway due to one of the minelayers hitting a mine and then sinking. From 23 to 24 April, Z39, two other destroyers, and eight minelayers laid the Seeigel 7b 3 barrage in Narva Bay. From 25 to 26 April Z39, two other destroyers, and nine minelayers laid the Seeigel 8b barrage southwest of Suur Tyarsaari. During the operations between 13 and 26 April, a total of 2,831 mines and 1,174 sweep detonators were laid. On 23 June of the same year, she was damaged by Soviet bombers while moored off of Paldiski and was escorted to Libau by Z28. After reaching Libau on 29 June, Z39 made her way to Kiel for repairs by way of the Piast Canal near Swinemunde. While at port in Kiel on 24 July, she was hit by a bomb when the British air force bombed Kiel Harbour, causing damage to her quarterdeck and leading to her having to be towed back to Swinemunde. She was repaired using parts cannibalised from Z44 and Z45. Z44 had been damaged in an air raid on 29 July while in Bremen and sunk so that only her superstructure remained above water, and Z45 was being built. Z39 had been repaired enough to be seaworthy on 28 February 1945, and was ordered to sail to Copenhagen for more extensive repairs, but due to Nazi Germany's lack of fuel, she sailed to Sassnitz instead. During this time, the Kriegsmarine, which had always dealt with shortages in oil, reached critically low levels of oil supply. On 25 March, Z39 finished repairs while in Swinemunde and resumed operations on 1 April. From 5 April to 7 April, she escorted transports and parts of Task Force Thiele around the Bay of Danzig. From 8 April to 9 April, she provided naval gunfire support for the German army. On 10 April she and T33 escorted the German destroyer Z43, which had sustained damage from both mines and bombs, to Warnemunde and Swinemunde. From 1944, German surface ships were called upon to provide support for the Army Group North along the Baltic Sea coast. This often involved shelling land targets, something in which the German ship crews had no training. This tactical use of cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats was difficult in the restrictive waterways of the Baltic, but despite these difficulties, it justified the continued existence of the surface fleet. The Soviet Union's continued advances along the east Baltic coast also spurred this change. From the spring of 1945 to near the end of the war, the surface forces of the Kriegsmarine became almost entirely focused upon resupplying and supporting garrisons along the Baltic Coast. Later, after March, the Kriegsmarine embarked upon the task of evacuating hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers from the east ahead of the Soviet forces, which were rapidly pushing westward. Z39 took part in a number of these evacuation operations. On 15 April Z39, two other destroyers, and four torpedo boats escorted German steamships Matthias Stinnes, Eberhart Essberger, Pretoria and Askari to Copenhagen, with a total of 20,000 refugees. On 2 May, she shelled Soviet Army forces from the Oder estuary. On 3 May, she, alongside the battleship Schlesien, moved to protect the bridge across the Peene river at Wolgast. After Schlesien hit a mine near Greifswalder Oie on the same day, Z39 towed her to Swinemunde, where Schlesien was deliberately grounded. The ship was placed so that her guns could fire on and defend roads leading into the city. One day later, Z39, three other destroyers, one torpedo boat, one ship tender, one auxiliary cruiser, one anti aircraft ship, and five steamer ships, sailed for Copenhagen, taking 35,000 wounded soldiers and refugees with them. On 8 May, Z39, six other destroyers, and five torpedo boats set sail with 20,000 soldiers and civilians from Hela to Glucksburg, and arrived on May 9. Following the German surrender, she was decommissioned from the Kriegsmarine on 10 May 1945 at Kiel. At some point after the war ended, Z39 was sailed by a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, and then, on 6 July 1945, to Plymouth. The US claimed her as a prize ship on 12 July. She left England on 30 July, and arrived in Boston on 7 August, where, on 14 September, after extensive trials, she was commissioned into the US Navy as DD 939. She was used by the US Navy in order to test her equipment, namely her high pressure steam propulsion plant. In late 1947, the US Navy deemed her obsolete, and transferred her to the French Navy. After arriving in Casablanca in January 1948, she sailed to Toulon, redesignated Q 128, and was cannibalised for her parts, which were used to repair the French destroyers Kleber ex Z6 Theodor Riedel , Hoche ex Z25 , and Marceau ex Z31 . She served as a pontoon for minesweepers near Brest, until she was broken up in 1964.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20Z39
"Z43 was a Type 1936B destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine German Navy during World War II. Completed in mid 1944, the ship spent the war in the Baltic Sea, escorting German ships, laying minefields, and bombarding Soviet forces. She participated in a minelaying operation in December 1944, where her sister ships Z35 and Z36 were sunk when they accidentally entered a German minefield. She was badly damaged by a mine on 10 April 1945, and scuttled on 3 May of that same year. The Type 1936B design retained the hull design of the Type 1936A, but reverted to the lighter main armament of the Type 1936 to reduce topweight and improve seakeeping. The ships had an overall length of 127 metres 416 ft 8 in and was 121.9 metres 399 ft 11 in long at the waterline. They had a beam of 12 metres 39 ft 4 in , and a maximum draught of 4.32 metres 14 ft 2 in . The ships displaced 2,519 long tons 2,559 t at standard load and 3,542 long tons 3,599 t at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 70,000 metric horsepower 51,000 kW 69,000 shp using steam provided by six Wagner water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . The ships carried a maximum of 835 tonnes 822 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,600 nautical miles 4,800 km 3,000 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Their crew consisted of 1115 officers and 30520 sailors. The Type 1936B ships carried five 12.7 centimetre 5 in SK C 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were designated No. 1 to 5 from front to rear. Their anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimetre 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and fifteen 2 centimetre 0.8 in C 38 guns in three quadruple and three single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimetre 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 7476 mines. 'GHG' Gruppenhorchgerat passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and a S Gerat sonar was also probably fitted. The ships were equipped with a FuMO 24 search radar above the bridge. Z43 was originally ordered as a Type 1938B destroyer from AG Weser Deschimag on 28 June 1939, but the contract was cancelled when the Type 1938B design was abandoned, and the ship was reordered as a Type 1936A Mob destroyer. That was changed to a Type 1936B on 17 February 1941. She was laid down as yard number W1029 on 1 May 1942 at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard, launched on 22 September 1943 and commissioned on 31 May 1944 under the command of Fregattenkapitan Commander Carl Heinrich Lampe. After working up Z43 was assigned to the 6. Zerstorerflotille 6th Destroyer Flotilla in October 1944. The following month, the flotilla and the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Prinz Eugen shelled Soviet positions during the evacuation of Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, between 20 and 24 November. In mid December, the 6. Zerstorerflotille, which now consisted of Z43, her sisters Z35 and Z36, and the large torpedo boats T23 and T28, was tasked to lay a new minefield between the Estonian coast and an existing minefield slightly further out to sea. T23 was to escort the other ships and the destroyers were laden with 68 mines each. The mission was postponed to the night of 11 12 December because of bad weather and the flotilla sailed on the morning of the 11th. The weather gradually worsened over the course of the day and the spray and rain made navigation difficult. Having sailed a bit too far north, Z35 and Z36 blundered into the Nashorn Rhinoceros minefield that was only 2.5 nautical miles 4.6 km 2.9 mi north of the intended position of the new minefield. They both struck mines and sank around 02 00 so close to the minefield, no effort was made to rescue any survivors in the darkness. In January and early February 1945, Z43 escorted convoys between Gotenhafen, Germany, and Libau, Latvia. Between 18 and 24 February, German forces launched a local counterattack in Samland Admiral Scheer, Z43, and other ships provided artillery support, targeting Soviet positions near Peyse and Gross Heydekrug. The German attack temporarily restored the land connection to Konigsberg. On 27 February, the ship helped to escort the ocean liner SS Hamburg to Sassnitz. Z43 escorted Admiral Scheer and her sister Lutzow from Danzig Bay to Swinemunde on 7 March and then bombarded Soviet positions near Kolberg from 11 to 18 March to cover the evacuation of the city. From 23 March to 7 April, the ship escorted Lutzow and other German ships in Danzig Bay while also bombarding Soviet troops. Z43 was struck by a Soviet bomb that failed to detonate on 9 April, but she struck a mine the following day. The explosion blew a 15 by 4 metre 49 ft 13 ft hole in her hull, broke her keel, and flooded the centre and aft boiler rooms. The torpedo boat T33 began a tow, but the destroyer was later able to steam under her own power to Rostock for emergency repairs that included welding several beams to the hull to strengthen it. Z43 then steamed into Warnemunde harbour to provide gunfire support for German troops ashore after having off loaded all of her anti aircraft guns and some of her crew. She departed Warnemunde on 2 May for Kiel, having exhausted all of her ammunition. The ship was scuttled near Flensburg the following day.

"Martino Zaccaria was the Lord of Chios from 1314 to 1329, ruler of several other Aegean islands, and baron of VeligostiDamala and Chalandritsa in the Principality of Achaea. He distinguished himself in the fight against Turkish corsairs in the Aegean Sea, and received the title of King and Despot of Asia Minor from the titular Latin Emperor, Philip II. He was deposed from his rule of Chios by a Byzantine expedition in 1329, and imprisoned in Constantinople until 1337. Martino then returned to Italy, where he was named the Genoese ambassador to the Holy See. In 1343 he was named commander of the Papal squadron in the Smyrniote crusade against Umur Bey, ruler of the Emirate of Aydin, and participated in the storming of Smyrna in October 1344. He was killed, along with several other of the crusade's leaders, in a Turkish attack on 17 January 1345. Martino Zaccaria was a scion of the Genoese Zaccaria family. Some modern sources give conflicting views about his father, either said to be Paleologo Zaccaria , or Nicolino Zaccaria. He may accordingly have been either a grandson or a nephew to Benedetto I Zaccaria, lord of Chios and of Phocaea on the Anatolian coast. Benedetto I had captured Chios from the Byzantine Empire in 1304, citing the island's vulnerability to Turkish raids. His occupation was acknowledged by the impotent Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos, initially for a period of 10 years, but which was then renewed at five year intervals. Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in Chios by his son, Paleologo Zaccaria. When he died childless in 1314, the island passed to Martino and his brother, Benedetto II. Chios was a small but wealthy domain, with an annual income of 120,000 gold hyperpyra. Over the next few years, Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of Asia Minor, including Samos and Kos. As lord of Chios, Martino and Benedetto fought with distinction against the Turkish pirates, who made their appearance in the Aegean in the early years of the 14th century. In 1304, the capture of Ephesus by the emirate of Menteshe had sparked the Genoese occupation of Chios, and raids against the Aegean islands intensified over the next years. The Emirate of Aydin soon emerged as the chief Turkish maritime emirate, especially under the leadership of Umur Bey, while the Zaccaria, along with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, became the two main Latin antagonists of the Turkish pirates. The Zaccaria are reported to have maintained a thousand infantry, a hundred horsemen and a couple of galleys on constant alert. In 1317, they lost the citadel of Smyrna on the Anatolian coast to the Aydinids, but continued to hold on to the lower city until 1329, when Umur Bey captured it. In 1319, however, Martino Zaccaria participated with seven ships in a Hospitaller fleet that scored a crushing victory over an Aydinid fleet from Ephesus. By the end of his rule on Chios, Martino is said to have taken captive or slain more than 10,000 Turks, and received an annual tribute in order not to attack them. His constant efforts against the Turkish pirates earned him great praise by contemporary Latin writers, who wrote that if not for his vigilance, neither man, nor woman, nor dog, nor cat, nor any live animal could have remained in any of the neighbouring islands . Martino also intervened to stop the slave trade carried out by the Genoese of Alexandria, for which he was praised by Pope John XXII. In exchange, the Pope granted him the right to export mastic to Egyptan exemption to the papal ban on trade with the Mamluks of Egyptand proposed that the Zaccaria be given command of the Latin fleets in the Aegean. Martino's prestige rose further when he also became one of the most important feudatories in the Principality of Achaea. Shortly after 1316, he bought the rights to the Barony of Chalandritsa from Aimon of Rans, although in a document of 1324 it appears that he possessed only half of it, the other being held by Peter dalle Carceri. Martino added to his domains when he married Jacqueline de la Roche, related to the De la Roche dukes of Athens and heiress of the Barony of VeligostiDamala. Martino's elevated standing was now recognized by Philip II, titular Latin emperor of Constantinople, who in 1325 named him King and Despot of Asia Minor and gave him as fiefs the islands of Chios, Samos, Kos, and Lesboswhich formed part of the Latin emperors' personal domain by the Treaty of Viterboas well as Ikaria, Tenedos, Oinousses and Marmara Island. This award was mostly symbolic, as except for the first three, which the Zaccaria already controlled, the others were in the hands of the Byzantines or the Turks. In exchange, Martino promised to aid with 500 horsemen in Philip's hoped for, but never to be realized, expedition to recover Constantinople from the Byzantines. If these ties to the Latin Emperor provoked displeasure at the Byzantine court, for the time being relations remained good the lease of Chios was renewed in 1324, and in 1327 Martino took part in alliance negotiations between the Byzantines and the Republic of Venice. At the same time, however, Martino's behaviour became increasingly assertive c. 1325 he ousted his brother as co ruler of Chios and began minting coins in his own name. In 1328, the rise of a new and energetic emperor, Andronikos III Palaiologos, to the Byzantine throne, marked a turning point in relations. One of the leading Chian nobles, Leo Kalothetos, went to meet the new emperor and his chief minister, John Kantakouzenos, to propose a reconquest of the island. Andronikos III readily agreed. On the pretext of Martino's unauthorized building of a new fortress on the island, the emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction, and to present himself in Constantinople in the next year in order to renew the island's lease. Martino haughtily rejected the demands and accelerated construction, but now his deposed brother Benedetto lodged a complaint with the emperor claiming the one half share of the island's revenues that was his due. With these events as an excuse, in autumn 1329 Andronikos III assembled a fleet of 105 vesselsincluding the forces of the Latin Duke of Naxos, Nicholas I Sanudoand sailed to Chios. Even after the imperial fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions in exchange for the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession in the same way as his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty. Martino was released in 1337 at the intercession of the Pope and Philip VI of France, and was offered a military command and some castles by the emperor as compensation. He then returned to his hometown, Genoa, and was named the city's ambassador to the Holy See. In September 1343, he was appointed to command the four papal galleys in the crusade against Umur Bey, under the overall command of the titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, Henry of Asti. In view of Zaccaria's character, the Pope expressly warned Henry of Asti not to allow him to divert the crusade in a bid to recover Chios, and authorized Henry to replace Zaccaria if he deemed it necessary. The crusade scored a swift and unexpected success Umur Bey was caught off guard, and the crusaders recaptured the lower town of Smyrna on 28 October 1344. The citadel remained in Turkish hands, however, and the crusaders' position remained precarious. With Venetian aid, they fortified the lower town to enable them to resist Umur's counterattack. The emir bombarded the lower town with mangonels, but the crusaders managed to sortie and destroy them, effectively breaking the siege. To celebrate this feat, Henry of Asti decided, against the advice of the other crusader leaders, to hold mass in the city's former cathedral, which lay in the no man's land between the citadel and the crusader held lower town. The Turks attacked during the service, on 17 January 1345, and killed Zaccaria, Henry of Asti and other crusader leaders present. Martino Zaccaria married, probably some time before 1325, Jacqueline de la Roche. An earlier conjecture of Karl Hopf about a first marriage to a daughter of George I Ghisi, heir to the lordship of Tinos and Mykonos, has since been discarded. From his marriage, Martino had two sons",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martino%20Zaccaria
"Ravi Zacharias born 26 March 1946 is an Indian born Canadian American Christian apologist. A defender of evangelical Protestantism, Zacharias is the author of numerous Christian books, including the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Gold Medallion Book Award winner Can Man Live Without God in the category theology and doctrine and Christian bestsellers Light in the Shadow of Jihad and The Grand Weaver. Zacharias is the founder and chairman of the board of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries RZIM and host of the radio programs Let My People Think and Just Thinking. Zacharias was born in 1946 in Madras, India. His family moved to Delhi when he was quite young and he grew up there. His family were Anglican, but he says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. Zacharias says that it was John 14 19 that touched him as the defining paradigm Because I live, you also will live. He said that he thought, This may be my only hope A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life. and that he committed his life to Christ praying, Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth. In 1966, Zacharias immigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 now Tyndale University College Seminary and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990, he did a two to three month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in Cambridge, England. Ridley Hall is not part of the University of Cambridge, although it does maintain a relationship with the university to offer theological education. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees. Zacharias spent the summer of 1971 in Vietnam, where he evangelized US soldiers, as well as imprisoned Viet Cong members. After graduating from Ontario Bible College, he began an itinerant ministry with the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Canada C MA . In 1974 the C MA sent him to Cambodia, where he preached only a short time before its fall to the Khmer Rouge. In 1977, after graduating from Trinity, Zacharias was commissioned by the C MA to preach worldwide. In 1983, Zacharias was invited to speak in Amsterdam at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's annual evangelists' conference. It was here that he first noticed a lack of ministry in the area of Christian apologetics. After Amsterdam, Zacharias spent the summer evangelizing in India, where he continued to see the need for apologetics ministry, both to lead people to Christ and to train Christian leaders. In August 1984 Ravi Zacharias International Ministries was founded in Toronto, Canada to pursue his calling as a classical evangelist in the arena of the intellectually resistant. Today its headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia, and has offices in Canada, India, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Hong Kong, Romania, Turkey, Austria, Spain, and South Africa. He was later ordained by the Christian and Missionary Alliance and commissioned as an international evangelist. In 1989, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zacharias was invited to speak in Moscow. While there he spoke to students at the Lenin Military Academy as well as political leaders at the Center for Geopolitical Strategy. This was the first of many evangelism opportunities in the political sphere. Future events included an invitation to Bogota, Colombia in 1993, where he spoke to members of the judiciary on the importance of having a solid moral foundation. In 1990 he wrote his first book, A Shattered Visage The Real Face of Atheism. In 1993 Zacharias was invited to speak at his first Veritas Forum at Harvard University, and later that year was one of the keynote speakers at Urbana. Zacharias continues to be a frequent guest at these forums, both giving lectures and answering students in question and answer sessions at academic institutions such as the University of Georgia, the University of Michigan, and Penn State. Zacharias attracted media attention when in 2004 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church opened its signature pulpit at the Salt Lake Tabernacle to him for a series of messages. Zacharias delivered a sermon on Who Is the Truth Defending Jesus Christ as The Way, The Truth and The Life to some 7,000 lay persons and scholars from both LDS and Protestant camps in an initiatory move towards open dialogue between the camps. Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' decision not to use this opportunity to directly address the deep and foundational differences between the historic Christian faith and that of the teachings of the LDS Church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but graciously build one step at a time in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction . He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment. Zacharias is a frequent keynote lecturer within the evangelical community at events such as the Future of Truth conference in 2004, the National Religious Broadcasters' Convention and Exposition in 2005, the National Conference on Christian Apologetics in 2006. On successive nights in October 2007, he addressed first the students and faculty of Virginia Tech, then the community of Blacksburg, Virginia, on the topic of evil and suffering in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre. Zacharias has represented the evangelical community at occasions such as the National Day of Prayer in Washington, DC, the Annual Prayer Breakfast at the United Nations, and the African Union Prayer Breakfast in Maputo, Mozambique, and was named honorary chairman of the 2008 National Day of Prayer task force. He also participated in the ecumenical Together 16 meetings in July 2016, which Pope Francis addressed, describing the event as a valiant effort. Zacharias was interviewed in Focus on the Family's Truth Project. In November 2009, Zacharias signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration which affirms the sanctity of human life, the dignity of marriage as a union of husband and wife, and the freedom of religion are foundational principles of justice and the common good. In 2014, Zacharias republished his book The Lamb and The Fuhrer, an imaginary conversation between Adolf Hitler, Jesus Christ and Dietrich Bonhoffer, as a graphic novel. In 2016, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio appointed Zacharias to his pro life Dignity Of Life advisory panel. In 2017, Christianity Today reported accusations from bloggers that Zacharias had exaggerated his academic credentials. Zacharias was alleged to have referred to himself in multiple articles and videos with the Dr. prefix, despite lacking a PhD qualification. The report went on to say that he has conferred ten honorary doctorates and in Ravis homeland of India... honorific titles are customary and are used frequently out of respect for elders, including by the RZIM India team when addressing Ravi. The veracity of Zacharias's purported academic positions at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was also questioned. In a statement, RZIM indicated that earlier years, 'Dr.' did appear before Ravi's name in some of our materials, including on our website, which is an appropriate and acceptable practice with honorary doctorates. However, because this practice can be contentious in certain circles, we no longer use it. Christianity Today reported that Zacharias's online biography was edited following the accusations regarding his credentials. Canadian ministry supporter, Lori Anne Thompson accused Zacharias of impropriety involving sexting and exchanging inappropriate emails with her. Christianity Today magazine reported that Zacharias filed a RICO suit against Thompson in response to a demand letter containing explicit allegations against Zacharias. The case was settled in November 2017. In a December 3, 2017 statement, Zacharias said, Let me state categorically that I never met alone, publicly or privately. The question is not whether I solicited or sent any illicit photos or messages to I did not, and there is no evidence to the contrarybut rather, whether I should have been a willing participant in any extended communication with a woman not my wife. The answer, I can unequivocally say, is no, and I fully accept responsibility. Zacharias added that he had been absolutely faithful to his wife Margie throughout their marriage, but acknowledged that he failed to exercise wise caution and to protect from even the appearance of impropriety... Zacharias declined to comment on the alleged suicide threat he made to Ms. Thompson, citing the terms of his non disclosure agreement with Thompson. Zacharias states that a coherent worldview must be able to satisfactorily answer four questions that of origin, meaning of life, morality, and destiny. He says that while every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth, the Christian faith is unique in its ability to answer all four of these questions. He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview, saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks. Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels the theoretical, to line up the logic of the argument the arts, to illustrate and kitchen table talk , to conclude and apply. Zacharias' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity's answers to life's great existential questions, with defense of God. In May 1972, Zacharias married Margaret Margie Reynolds, whom he met at his church's youth group. They have three children. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi%20Zacharias
"Zack Fair , Zakkusu Fea is a fictional character first introduced as a non player character in the 1997 role playing video game Final Fantasy VII by Square now Square Enix , and subsequently expanded upon in the metaseries Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. In the original game, Zack is a late member of the paramilitary organization SOLDIER, the military wing of the megacorporation Shinra. During the game, Zack is revealed to have been Aerith Gainsborough's first boyfriend, as well as a friend of Cloud Strife, the game's protagonist. Zack ultimately died in the weeks leading up to the opening of the game protecting Cloud from Shinra's army after they had escaped from imprisonment and being the subjects of genetic experimentation. He is the second owner of the Buster Sword , Basuta Sodo , and wielded it before Cloud, giving it to him as he died. Zack also appears in the Compilation titles Before Crisis Final Fantasy VII, Last Order Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and, most significantly, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII, a prequel in which he is the protagonist. Zack Fair was originally not a part of Final Fantasy VII. However, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to bring a sense of mystery to the title, and created the character to help complicate Cloud's backstory. He was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and his name derived from fair weather, to contrast with Cloud Strife's name. With Zack's conceptual backstory in place for Final Fantasy VII, the staff decided to use Compilation of Final Fantasy VII to expand upon his character. Zack is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura in Japanese and Rick Gomez in English. Suzumura was chosen specifically by Nomura for his voice, and was given the role without an audition. Western critics have praised Zack's character, commenting on his development since Final Fantasy VII. Zack did not exist in the original scenario of Final Fantasy VII, but was created only when scenario writer Kazushige Nojima decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background. Nojima had always planned for Cloud Strife's memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and Aerith Gainsborough, as Aerith had seen something of Zack in Cloud. Zack was the first person Aerith liked, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first love was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist Sephiroth. As the game continued in its development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some of the scenes in the game needing revision. Director Yoshinori Kitase was surprised by the revelation of Cloud's and Zack's connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura got the request to design Zack when Final Fantasy VII was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes so as to give clues about him, despite the fact that he did not reveal to the staff Zack's existence until later. Zack appears as a young man with spiky black hair, standing 185 cm 6 ft 1 in tall. He wears the SOLDIER 1st class uniform, consisting of a black, sleeveless turtleneck, black boots, and armor. In Crisis Core, Zack has two attires his Final Fantasy VII outfit and a different outfit worn during the start of the game, which he changes after fighting Angeal Hewley. Zack's full name was first revealed in an article in Dengeki PlayStation. Nomura stated that Zack's name was derived from 'fair weather' and specifically chosen because it contrasted with Cloud Strife's name. For Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, Zack made only a couple of brief appearances, and as such, was not difficult to animate the team had also acquired his design early in production, allowing modeling of his character to be taken care of. Nomura had wanted Zack to have a nice, upbeat voice, which influenced his decision to cast Kenichi Suzumura. Beforehand, Nomura had had dinner with Suzumura, where he had decided that at that point wanted him to be in one of his projects if the opportunity ever presented itself. Suzumura was offered the role without an audition. Nomura explained that, because Zack had been chosen to be the lead in Last Order Final Fantasy VII, he needed someone who could handle role well. The staff used Last Order as an opportunity to portray Zack properly as a handsome, light hearted man was in everyone's memory. In English, Zack is voiced by Rick Gomez. In an interview with IGN whilst promoting Crisis Core, Yoshinori Kitase explained that when the original game was created, Zack was a rather minor character, although Nomura had created art design, and Nojima had created a basic concept of Zack's story. Kitase further explained that you could say that the idea has been cooking for 10 years. Before Crisis Core began development, the staff had planned to create a PlayStation Portable port of Before Crisis Final Fantasy VII, but soon changed their minds to create a game that focused on Zack, whose fate was already predetermined fans knew how the game was going to end. Throughout the game, the staff decided to use a blue sky in cutscenes to represent Zack, while other features in such scenes are meant to symbolize his connections. A number of Zack's actions from the game were also designed so as to augment the similarities that Aerith finds between him and Cloud in Final Fantasy VII. Zack and Cloud's connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game's ending, with both of them planning to flee to Midgar. However, due to limitations in the console's hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack's role as a warrior. Zack had only a small role in the original Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It is at this point that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he was the result of a scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments. Zack's character and backstory is expanded upon throughout the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. In the prequel game Before Crisis, Zack supports Shinra in their fight against the eco terrorist group AVALANCHE. During the game, two of his SOLDIER acquaintances are captured and experimented upon, and though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them. Zack also makes an appearance during the chapter covering the Nibelheim incident, and later as a boss character when he and Cloud are fugitives from Shinra and are being pursued by the Turks. The OVA Last Order Final Fantasy VII follows Zack and Cloud's journey to Midgar with flashbacks of the Nibelheim incident. Zack also has a small role in the film sequel Advent Children, where most of his appearances are flashbacks from Cloud's point of view. He also appears at the end of the film, where he and the now deceased Aerith speak to Cloud. In the director's cut version, Advent Children Complete, his role is expanded, and he makes an appearance during Cloud's battle with Sephiroth. His death is also shown in the film, where he gives Cloud the Buster Sword and tells him to become his living legacy . Zack is the protagonist of Crisis Core, a prequel to Final Fantasy VII, which deals primarily with Zack's backstory. In the game, Zack is trained as a SOLDIER by his close friend, Angeal Hewley, and hopes to become a hero while working for Shinra. When Angeal, and another SOLDIER, Genesis Rhapsodos, betray Shinra, Zack and Sephiroth are dispatched to kill them, but they decide to avoid doing that if possible. He and Sephiroth learn that both Angeal and Genesis were the result of a Shinra experiment called Project G , where they were injected with Jenova cells prior to being born in an effort to create perfect SOLDIERs. However, both Angeal and Genesis are suffering from secondary effects which led them to antagonize Shinra in the hopes of finding a cure. In the course of the game, Zack befriends Cloud and begins dating Aerith. During a mission to find Angeal and Genesis, Angeal forces Zack to kill him, as he wants to stop hurting people because of his mutations. Before dying, Angeal thanks Zack for stopping him and gives him his Buster Sword. Later, while Zack and Sephiroth search for Genesis and the former Shinra scientist Dr. Hollander, they go to Nibelheim where Sephiroth learns that he too was the result of genetic experimentation involving Jenova. The game then depicts the Nibelheim incident, leading to Zack and Cloud being taken captive and subjected to experiments themselves. Four years pass, Zack and Cloud are able to escape, and Zack learns that Genesis has come to believe the only way he can be cured is by being injected with Sephiroth's cells. As Sephiroth is thought dead, the only source of these cells is now Cloud, and Zack realises that Genesis plans to kill Cloud. Zack decides to stop Genesis, and after defeating him, he and Cloud head to Midgar, where he hopes to be reunited with Aerith. However, Zack and Cloud are intercepted by Shinra infantry, and Zack is killed. In his dying breath, Zack gives the Buster Sword to Cloud, telling him to be his living legacy. As Cloud stumbles off towards Midgar, Zack is pulled into the sky by Angeal, and wonders if he has become a hero. Zack has served as the basis for several forms of merchandise, such as being pictured on the Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Potion soft drink cans. Outside the Final Fantasy VII series, Zack is an unlockable character in the PlayStation version of the fighting game Ehrgeiz, where is playable in arcade, versus, and minigame events. He made his debut appearance in the Kingdom Hearts series in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PlayStation Portable, where he has a more youthful appearance than in his Final Fantasy incarnation. He is featured prominently in the Olympus Coliseum, commonly participating in tournaments in order to achieve his dream of becoming a hero. As the game is a prequel to the other Kingdom Hearts titles, the staff chose him as they wanted a character from a Final Fantasy prequel. Critical response to Zack's character has generally been positive. In IGN's 2008 list of Final Fantasy VII top ten characters list, Zack made sixth place, with IGN's Dave Smith noting that his check out scene in Crisis Core is just about as epic as it gets in videogames. In 2010, Famitsu readers voted Zack as the 37th most popular video game character in Japan. GamesRadar's Jim Sterling found Zack to be one of video game's most sexually appealing male characters due to his personality and look. In 2013, Complex ranked Zack as the 18th greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as the sixth greatest soldier in video games. Zack's role in Crisis Core has received a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it the heart of the game. Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a likable and complex hero, arguing that he transcends the usual spiky haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues. GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as King of the Nice Guys, noting that even though he can be a pretty hate worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline, players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an endearing main character by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero due to his personal conflicts, despite his artfully teased hair and devil may care grin. Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he reaches into his Zack's pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks. He also praised Zack's English voice actor for doing a good job, noting his character's maturing and developing over the 15 hour storyline. IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as pretty likeable. GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the ultimate payoff of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song Why for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate to the hearts of many people. IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game. On the other hand, PSXextreme's Ben Dutka, felt that Zack was not worthy of his own game, believing that only players with halfway decent memories and a hardcore completionist mentality will be able to remember Zack's appearances in the original Final Fantasy VII. IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin Poole called Zack Cloud's identical twin in all but hair colour, and complained about his personality being annoying during the first half of the game. Destructoid agreed, telling players not to expect to enjoy Zack if they do not like cocky teenagers, and even labelling him an annoying cockhole. Gameplanet criticized Rick Gomez' acting, finding it more immature than they expected. PALGN called Zack an unfamiliar character in the series since his only appearances were in backstories.

"Zaculeu or Saqulew is a pre Columbian Maya archaeological site in the highlands of western Guatemala, about 3.7 kilometres 2.3 mi outside of the modern city of Huehuetenango. Occupation at the site dates to the Early Classic period AD 250600 of Mesoamerican history. Zaculeu was the capital of the Postclassic Mam kingdom, and was conquered by the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj. It displays a mixture of Mam and K'iche' style architecture. In AD 1525 the city was attacked by Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras during a siege that lasted several months. Kayb'il B'alam, the city's last ruler, finally surrendered to the Spanish due to starvation. The site contains a number of temple pyramids with talud tablero style architecture and double stairways. The pyramids and governmental palaces are grouped around a series of large public plazas. The site also holds a ballcourt for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. The site was originally fortified with walls. The site was restored by the United Fruit Company in the late 1940s. It is open to tourists and includes a small museum. The name Zaculeu means white earth in the Mam, K'iche' and Q'anjob'al languages, from saq adj meaning white and ulew n meaning earth . In the Mam language, the site is also called Chinabajul. The archaeological site is located in the present day village of San Lorenzo on the outskirts of Huehuetenango city, in the Guatemalan department of Huehuetenango. Zaculeu is the main tourist attraction in the Huehuetenango area. Zaculeu is located at an altitude of 1,900 metres 6,200 ft above mean sea level, and is bordered by the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes mountain range. Zaculeu is located in an area of fertile soils close to the Selegua and Vina rivers. The site is situated on a plateau overlooking the Selegua River, which flows to the west of the city. Deep ravines bordering the site to the south and east protected its access. The only access to the site is via a narrow land bridge to the north which unites the plateau to the general level of the valley floor. The Zaculeu plateau measures 11,178 square varas 4191 square metres . Zaculeu was first occupied in the Early Classic Period AD 250600 , and the buildings from this era show the architectural influence of the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. The largest constructions date from the Classic Period AD 250900 . To these were added other plaza groups and buildings in the Early Postclassic AD 9001200 and Late Postclassic AD 12001525 in an unbroken history. Zaculeu has been used as a ceremonial site by Mam Maya continuously to the present. Zaculeu came under the influence of central Mexico again in the Late Classic. The architectural influence is so distinct that it suggests that a foreign Mexican elite may have settled at the city and continued in occupation there until the K'iche' conquered the site in the Postclassic. The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally that has been calculated as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating has pushed back the calculations of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their conquest of the Mam kingdoms may have taken place as early as the 12th century. The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century. The K'iche' king Q'uq'umatz died in battle against a group of the northern Mam. His son K'iq'ab continued where his father had left off and completed the conquest of the people. K'iq'ab was ruler when Zaculeu was conquered by the K'iche.' This appears to have been a second K'iche' conquest of the city, having previously fallen some time earlier. When the K'iche' conquered another kingdom, its practice was to place the newly subject kingdom under the control of one of the K'iche' noble lineages. Based on the style of Structure 4, archeologists believe that Zaculeu was likely controlled by the Nija'ib.' The Ilocab, who had conquered much of the region, are another possibility. The K'iche' tended to place their newly installed ruling elite in a mountain top fortress securing the population in the valleys below. However, substantial portions of the original Mam population remained in place in the plateau area. The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period structures in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout consists of a westward facing temple with a steep talud tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was likely to have been the temple of Awilix, patron goddess of the Nija'ib' K'iche'. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This K'iche' layout was somewhat distorted by the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, the juxtaposition of Mam and K'iche' style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages. Excavations have uncovered examples of metalwork at Zaculeu. These were small ornamental pieces. An example is a representation of a butterfly worked from tumbaga, an alloy of gold and copper, dated to the Postclassic period. Although hostilities existed between the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel people against their K'iche' allies, the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors shifted the political landscape. Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb'il B'alam was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam population was situated in Xinabahul also spelled Chinabjul , now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people the chronicles are not clear if this is the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu . After a siege lasting several months, the Mam were reduced to starvation. Kayb'il B'alam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish in October 1525. When the Spanish entered the city, they found 1,800 dead Indians, with the survivors eating the corpses of the dead. The Spanish forced the abandonment of Zaculeu after they built the new city of Huehuetenango some 5 kilometres 3.1 mi away. American explorer John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood visited the site in 1840, at which time it was a confused jumble of overgrown ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew. On 24 April 1931, Guatemala declared the site as a National Monument under the name of Tzaculeu. On 23 February 1946, the site was renamed as Zaculeu. The government gave a license to excavate to the United Fruit Company, which immediately began archaeological excavations and related restorations of the structures under the direction of John M. Dimick. This later included re coating a number of the buildings with white plaster, as it was known that many were originally finished that way. This has seldom been done in other restorations of Pre Columbian buildings. On 12 June 1970 the site was declared a National Precolumbian Monument by accord of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education MINEDUC . Zaculeu was likely originally developed because of its proximity to the Selegua River, providing a permanent water supply and transportation waterway, together with its easily defensible hilltop location. Zaculeu has 43 structures. The majority of construction activity took place in one burst in the Early Classic, with minor alterations thereafter. The smaller platforms situated in the plazas were late additions they show the influence of central Mexican civilization. The entrance to the site was via a narrow land bridge to the north, which was protected by a fortified structure that occupied three quarters of the width of the land bridge. The ceremonial centre of the city consisted of 43 structures clustered in an area of 1,400 square metres 15,000 sq ft . The architecture at the site includes talud tablero style buildings with double stairways. The facades of some of the buildings have cylindrical columns, a feature found in other parts of Mesoamerica. Artefacts recovered from the site include items fashioned from turquoise and precious metals. The metal artefacts crafted from gold, silver and copper and their alloys demonstrate the city's participation in the wider trade networks of the Postclassic Period. These metal artefacts were either influenced by or imported from Mexico and southern Central America. The structures at Zaculeu were grouped around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, coated with a thick layer of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and very little in the way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings. An Early Classic tomb was inserted under the main pyramid at Zaculeu it had been tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when the roof of the tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj. The site core is laid out around eight plazas. Some of the structures were restored by the United Fruit Company most of these border Plazas 1 and 2. Structures 1 and 2 are pyramid temples. Structures 4, 6 and 10 are palace structures, long buildings with internal chambers and benches used as residences and for administrative purposes. Plaza 1 is the main plaza at the site. It measures 54 by 38 metres 177 by 125 ft and is closed on all four sides by pyramid temples. Plaza 2 is a large plaza at the southeast of the site core, south of Plaza 1. It is bordered on the southeastern side by Structure 4, on the northeast by Structure 1, on the northwest by the ballcourt and on the southwest by Plaza 3. Plaza 3 is a small plaza at the southern extreme of the site core, southwest of Plaza 2 and south of the ballcourt. Plaza 4 is at the northwest side of the site core. It is closed on the northeastern side by Structure 10, on the southeast by Structure 13 and on the southwest by the ballcourt. Plazas 5 and 6 are located immediately to the west. Plaza 5 is a small plaza immediately west of Plaza 4 and northwest of the ballcourt. It is divided from Plaza 6 to the northwest by Structure 21. Plaza 6 is another small plaza to the west of Plaza 4. It is enclosed on three sides by a building complex with Structure 21 on the southeast side. Plaza 7 is a small plaza at the western extreme of the site core, to the west of Plazas 5 and 6. Plaza 8 is an enclosed plaza to the southwest of the ballcourt. Structure 2, a pyramid, closes the northwest side and Structure 3 closes the southeast side. Structure 1 is a 39 foot 12 m high pyramid on the southeast side of Plaza 1. It has eight stepped sections topped by a summit shrine. The shrine has three doorways approached via a double stairway rising from the plaza below. The pyramid was rebuilt seven times with the visible remains dating to the Early Postclassic. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic period. Structure 2 is a pyramid on the northwest side of the sunken Plaza 8. It is largely unrestored. Structure 3 lies across the plaza to the southeast. It is a platform with a twin stairway facing northwest onto the plaza. Structure 3 is on the southeast side of Plaza 8, facing onto the plaza opposite Structure 2. It is immediately south of the ballcourt. Structure 4 is an unusual combination of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although the roof of the temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold. Structure 6 is a temple on the northeast side of Plaza 1. It rises in stepped sections topped by a summit shrine and was accessed via a stairway from the plaza that divided in two near the summit. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the shrine remain. Structure 9 is a large mound on the northwest side of Plaza 1. The last phase of construction shows evidence of the interruption of construction by the Spanish Conquest. Terraces were absent on three sides of the structure with only the lowest level having been built on the fourth. Early Classic ceramic caches were discovered under Structure 9. Structure 10 borders the northeast side of Plaza 4 and is unrestored although some original stonework is evident. It is a very long building accessed via three stairways ascending from the plaza. The structure has been investigated by archaeologists and was found to have multiple doorways opening into a single long room. Structures 11 and 12 are small platforms in the middle of Plaza 1. They have both been restored. Structure 13 is on the southwest side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double stairway ascending from Plaza 1. This double stairway gave access to the first level of the temple structure only from there, a wide single stairway continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a low platform that supported a perishable superstructure. Structures 15 and 16 are both low platforms located in Plaza 2, on an axis running directly northwest across the plaza from the central temple of Structure 4. Structure 17 is a pyramidal base in Plaza 2, to the west of Structures 15 and 16. It supported two rooms accessed via a double stairway on the northwest side of the temple. The entrance to outermost room once had two columns, although now only the lower portions of the walls and columns remain. Structure 21 is a low platform in Plaza 5, it is partially restored and has a stairway on the northwest side. The Ballcourt consists of Structures 22 and 23, it was used for the ceremonial Mesoamerican ballgame. It is an I shaped sunken ballcourt with sloping walls. The two structures forming the sides of the ballcourt once supported buildings, now only the lower sections of their walls remain. The ballcourt is oriented northwest to southeast and is 48 metres 157 ft long. Structure 37 is not associated with any of the eight plazas of the site core, standing about 50 metres 160 ft northeast of Structure 4 and a similar distance east of Structure 1. It was investigated by archaeologists but has not been restored, although some of the original stonework and plaster coating is visible.

"Ceasefire Yugoslav Ground Forces Yugoslav Air Force Yugoslav Navy Croatian National Guard 1992 1993 1994 1995 The Battle of Zadar Croatian Bitka za Zadar was a military engagement between the Yugoslav People's Army Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA , supported by the Croatian Serb Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina SAO Krajina , and the Croatian National Guard Zbor Narodne Garde, or ZNG , supported by the Croatian Police. The battle was fought north and east of the city of Zadar, Croatia, in the second half of September and early October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Although the JNA's initial orders were to lift the Croatian siege of the JNA's barracks in the city and isolate the region of Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia, the orders were amended during the battle to include capturing the Port of Zadar in the city centre. The JNA's advance was supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and Navy. Fighting stopped on 5 October, when a cease fire agreement was reached by the belligerents after the JNA reached the outskirts of Zadar and blocked all land routes to the city. Subsequent negotiations resulted in a partial withdrawal of the JNA, restoring road access to Zadar via the Adriatic Highway and the evacuation of JNA facilities in the city. The JNA achieved a portion of its stated objectives while it blocked the Maslenica Bridge the last overland route between the Croatian capital of Zagreb and Zadar , a road via Pag Island relying on a ferry remained open. The JNA Zadar garrison was evacuated as a result of negotiations, but the ZNG captured several relatively small JNA posts in the city. The port was never captured by the JNA, although it was blockaded by the Yugoslav Navy. The SeptemberOctober fighting caused 34 civilian deaths in Zadar from the artillery bombardment. Croatia later charged 19 JNA officers involved in the offensive with war crimes against the civilian population they were tried, convicted in absentia and sentenced to prison. After the 1990 electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence Teritorijalna obrana, or TO weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia. After two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA supported by Serbia and its allies asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA was brought under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Milosevic, preferring the expansion of Serbia to the preservation of Yugoslavia, threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually replace plans to preserve Yugoslavia with Serbian expansion. By the end of March, the conflict escalated after the first fatalities during an incident at Plitvice Lakes. The JNA stepped in, supporting the insurgents and preventing the Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia this was seen by the Government of Croatia as an intention to secede from Croatia. At the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army to bolster its defence, the country doubled its police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective portion of the force was the 3,000 strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure an additional 9,00010,000 regionally organized reserve police were grouped into 16 battalions and 10 independent companies. Although most were equipped with small arms, a portion of the force was unarmed. In May the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard Zbor narodne garde, or ZNG , but its development was hampered by a United Nations UN arms embargo introduced in September. In April and early May, ethnic tensions in Zadar and northern Dalmatia escalated after increased sabotage activities targeting communications, the power distribution grid and other property. On 2 May, the situation continued to deteriorate after the killings of Croatian policemen at Borovo Selo and Franko Lisica a member of the Croatian special police in the village of Polaca near Zadar by Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina SAO Krajina troops. The news incited riots in Zadar that day, with crowds marching through the city centre demanding weapons to confront the Croatian Serbs and smashing the windows of shops owned by Serbian companies and Serbs living in the city. Croat owned businesses in Knin were destroyed in retaliation during the night of 78 May. The JNA took an active role in events in nearby Benkovac on 19 May, distributing a leaflet with the names of 41 Croats targeted for immediate execution and providing weapons to SAO Krajina forces in the area. In late May, the conflict gradually escalated to exchanges of mortar fire. From late June through July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat nonetheless, the conflict's increasing intensity in the region and elsewhere in Croatia caused residents of Zadar to build bomb shelters. SAO Krajina authorities called up three TO units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July a day after the fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area , and at the end of July the JNA 9th Knin Corps began conscripting the Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Krusevo near Obrovac they were involved in combat with the SAO Krajina TO and police forces two days later, the first engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. Growing appetites of the SAO Krajina were announced in mid August, when Milan Martic, one of its leaders, spoke of a planned conquest of Zadar. Later that month, the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina. On 26 August the 9th Knin Corps troops and artillery commanded by chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladic attacked the village of Kijevo, advancing with SAO Krajina forces to expel all Croats from the village. Another regional setback for Croatia was the 11 September JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge, cutting the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 14 September the ZNG and Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all accessible JNA facilities, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. The move affected 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia and a number of smaller facilities including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots , forcing the JNA to change its plans for the Croatian campaign. The planned JNA campaign included an advance in the Zadar area by the 9th Knin Corps. The corps began its operations against the ZNG on 16 September fully mobilised and prepared for deployment, it was tasked with isolating Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia. To achieve this, its units advanced with its main axis directed at Vodice and supporting advances directed towards Zadar, Drnis and Sinj. The initial push was intended to create conditions favouring attacks on Zadar, Sibenik and Split. The bulk of the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade, with its battalion of World War II vintage T 34 tanks replaced by a battalion of M 84 tanks from the corps reserve, was committed to the main axis of the attack and supported by elements of the SAO Krajina TO. The secondary advance towards Biograd na Moru was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade supported by the T 34 battalion detached from the 221st Brigade , the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and elements of the SAO Krajina TO. Further elements of the 221st Brigade were detached from the main axis and tasked with lifting the ZNG blockade of JNA garrisons in the Sinj and Drnis areas. The overall offensive was supported by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion. Despite its initial secondary role, the 3,000 strong 180th Brigade became the main attacking force deployed against Zadar. The city was defended by elements of the 4th Guards Brigade, the 112th Infantry Brigade, the independent BenkovacStankovci and Skabrnja battalions of the ZNG and the police. Although the JNA estimated Croatian troop strength at approximately 4,500, the Croatian units were poorly armed. The city's defence was commanded by Colonel Josip Tulicic, head of the Zadar Sector of the 6th Split Operational Zone. The offensive began at 16 00 on 16 September by the second day, JNA 9th Knin Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vukovic modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police who relied on populated areas and terrain features to hold back the JNA . Vukovic's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drnis and Sinj, resting the remainder of the attacking force. These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military Maritime District commander, Vice Admiral Mile Kandic. The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September, further isolating Zadar, and the city's electricity supply was cut on the first day of the JNA attack. The ZNG was driven out of Polaca, towards Skabrnja, on 18 September. Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar, the most significant the Turske kuce barracks and depot. The captures provided the ZNG with about 2,500 rifles, 100 M 53 machine guns and ammunition, although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons. The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence, but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate Croatian forces were spread too thin to defend the city and capture the remaining barracks, and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out. After this there was a lull in fighting in the Zadar area until the end of the month, with only sporadic small arms fire and minor skirmishes. During that period, the JNA's efforts were concentrated on the Battle of Sibenik and an advance towards Sinj. Although the ZNG defended Sibenik and Sinj it lost Drnis, abandoning it before the JNA's arrival on 23 September. During the last week of September the JNA returned its focus to Zadar, stepping up its artillery bombardment of the city and ending its naval blockade on 23 September. On 29 September the JNA edged towards Zadar, capturing the villages of Bulic, Lisane Ostrovicke and Vuksic and announcing its intention to evacuate its Zadar barracks which was affected by desertions . The fighting picked up again on 2 October, when a JNA tank and infantry attack on Nadinthe northernmost point of ZNG resistance in the Zadar areawas repelled. On 3 October, the Yugoslav Navy reinstated its Adriatic blockade. That day, the JNA 9th Knin Corps ordered a new push towards Zadar to relieve the city's JNA barracks, destroy the ZNG or drive it from the city and capture the Port of Zadar in the city centre. The attacking force was augmented by the 1st Battalion of the 592nd Mechanised Brigade. The offensive began at 13 00 on 4 October, supported by artillery, naval and air forces. The besieged JNA garrisons in the city, except for the Sepurine barracks garrison, also provided mortar and sniper support. The 271st Light Artillery Regiment and the 60th Medium Self Propelled Missile Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Defence, based in Sepurine, broke through the Croatian siege and joined the advancing JNA force. Although the ZNG and the police held the city and inflicted many casualties, by the night of 45 October Zadar was besieged by the JNA this forced the Croatian authorities to request a cease fire and negotiations. The cease fire was agreed at 16 00 on 5 October, and scheduled to begin two hours later negotiations were set for 09 00 the following day. However, the fighting continued negotiations did not take place as originally planned, with the JNA citing the Croatian general mobilization as the reason for their cancellation. Two days of negotiations then began at Zadar Airbase on 7 October. The talks involved Zadar JNA commander Vukovic, Colonel Trpko Zdravkovski and Colonel Momcilo Perisic. Major Kreso Jakovina represented the General Staff of the HV at the talks, with Tulicic representing the regional defence command. With additional input from Zadar civilian representatives Ivo Livljanic and Domagoj Kero, the cease fire went into effect at noon on 10 October. On 8 October, during the negotiations, Croatia declared its independence from SFR Yugoslavia. The JNA 9th Knin Corps had completed a significant part of its assigned task before the overall offensive against Croatian forces began in the second half of September by capturing the Maslenica Bridge, which blocked the Adriatic Highway and almost completely isolated Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia. This isolation was reinforced by the Yugoslav Navy blockade, which lasted until 13 October. However, the cease fire agreement ended the JNA siege and a supply route to Zadar was opened via the Pag Island road. The JNA remained on the outskirts of the city, threatening the ZNG defences. Although the ZNG and the police could not withstand the JNA forces supported by artillery and armour , they held Zadar the city celebrates its defence on 6 October each year. The cease fire agreement also provided for the evacuation of the JNA Zadar garrison. The evacuation, encompassing six barracks and 3,750 people, began on 11 October and took 15 days to complete. The JNA removed 2,1902,250 truckloads of weapons and equipment and the personal effects of JNA personnel and their families. Evacuated personnel and equipment were required to be removed from Croatian soil the JNA complied, except for its artillery which was primarily left for the SAO Krajina TO . The JNA also transferred 20 truckloads of weapons to the SAO Krajina TO in the area. On 18 October, the ZNG Independent BenkovacStaknovci Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion of the 112th Brigade to create the 134th Infantry Brigade. The exact number of casualties sustained by the ZNG, the police or the JNA has never been reported in Zadar, 34 civilians were killed and 120 structures damaged by artillery fire during September and October 1991. A group of 19 JNA officers, including Perisic and Mladic, were tried in absentia and convicted by a Croatian court for war crimes against the civilian population. After the JNA completed its evacuation of the Zadar garrison, its force north of the city regrouped and launched a new offensive on 18 November with infantry and armoured units supported by artillery bombardment and close air support . The attack targeted the villages of Skabrnja, Gorica, Nadin and Zemunik Donji. Skabrnja was captured on the first day after an air assault by a battalion of the JNA 63rd Parachute Brigade, and Nadin fell on 19 November. During and immediately after the attack on Skabrnja, the JNA and the supporting SAO Krajina TO forces killed 39 civilians and 14 ZNG soldiers in what became known as the Skabrnja massacre. Some of those killed were buried in a mass grave in the village twenty seven victims were exhumed in 1995, after the end of the war. Another seven civilians were killed in Nadin. On 21 November the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO destroyed the Maslenica Bridge and began reorienting their main effort towards Novigrad, Pridraga, Paljuv and Podgradina, on the right flank of the Zadar sector. Those efforts culminated on 31 December 1991 1 January 1992, when the four settlements were captured. On 3 January the JNA attacked Policnik and Zemunik Donji, again threatening the road to Pag and Zadar however, the advances failed. Zadar was bombarded by artillery during the offensive. A plan by the JNA 9th Knin Corps to advance to the Adriatic coast at Pirovac east of Zadar was drawn up by 30 December 1991 under the codename Strike 91 Udar 91 , but was not implemented. This period saw more war crimes committed by SAO Krajina troops, including the killing of nine civilians and a JNA member in the Bruska massacre on 21 December. Fighting stopped again on 3 January when a new cease fire, based on a peace plan brokered by United Nations Special Envoy Cyrus Vance, went into effect. In early 1992, the Independent Skabrnja Battalion became the 1st Battalion of the 159th Infantry Brigade. Control of the battlefield changed slightly during the night of 2223 May 1992, when Croatian forces captured Kriz Hill near Bibinje, southeast of Zadar this improved security along the Adriatic Highway. Another change took place in JanuaryFebruary 1993, when Croatian troops recaptured part of the Zadar hinterland in Operation Maslenica. The rest of the region was recaptured by Croatia during Operation Storm in August 1995.

"The Yugoslav destroyer Zagreb was the second of three Beograd class destroyers built for the Royal Yugoslav Navy Serbo Croatian Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica, KJRM in the late 1930s. Her main armament consisted of four Skoda 120 mm 4.7 in guns. When Yugoslavia entered World War II due to the German led Axis invasion of that country in April 1941, two of her officers scuttled her at the Bay of Kotor on 17 April 1941 to prevent her capture by approaching Italian forces. Both officers were killed by the explosion of the scuttling charges. A French film was made about her demise and the deaths of the two officers. In 1973, on the thirtieth anniversary of the formation of the Yugoslav Navy, both men were posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero by President Josip Broz Tito. In the early 1930s, the Royal Yugoslav Navy Serbo Croatian Kraljevska Jugoslavenska Ratna Mornarica, KJRM pursued the flotilla leader concept, which involved building large destroyers similar to the World War I Royal Navy V and W class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were intended to operate as half flotillas of three ships, or with one flotilla leader operating alongside several smaller destroyers. The KJRM decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that could reach high speeds and would have long endurance. The endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships to the central Mediterranean, where they would be able to operate alongside French and British warships. This resulted in the construction of the destroyer Dubrovnik in 19301931. Soon after she was ordered, the onset of the Great Depression meant that only one ship of the planned half flotilla was ever built. Despite the fact that the other two large destroyers were not going to be built, the idea persisted that Dubrovnik might lead a flotilla consisting of several smaller destroyers. In 1934, the KJRM decided to acquire three such destroyers to operate in a division led by Dubrovnik. The Beograd class was developed from a French design, and the second ship of the class, Zagreb, was built by Jadranska brodogradilista at Split, Yugoslavia, under French supervision. The ship had an overall length of 98 m 321 ft 6 in , a beam of 9.45 m 31 ft , and a normal draught of 3.18 m 10 ft 5 in . Her standard displacement was 1,210 tonnes 1,190 long tons , and she displaced 1,655 tonnes 1,629 long tons at full load. The ship was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by three Yarrow water tube boilers. Her turbines were rated at 40,000 shp 30,000 kW and she was designed to reach a top speed of 38 knots 70 km h 44 mph . She carried 120 tonnes 120 long tons of fuel oil. Although data is not available for Zagreb, her sister ship Beograd had a radius of action of 1,000 nautical miles 1,900 km 1,200 mi . The crew consisted of 145 officers and enlisted men. Her main armament consisted of four Skoda 120 mm 4.7 in L 46 superfiring guns in single mounts, two forward of the superstructure and two aft, protected by gun shields. Her secondary armament consisted of four Bofors 40 mm 1.6 in anti aircraft guns in two twin mounts, located on either side of the aft shelter deck. She was also equipped with two triple mounts of 550 mm 22 in torpedo tubes and two machine guns. Her fire control system was provided by the Dutch firm of Hazemayer. As built, she could also carry 30 naval mines. She was laid down in 1936, launched on 30 March 1938, and was commissioned into the KJRM in August 1939. At the time of the German led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Zagreb and her sister ship Beograd were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the Bay of Kotor. From the outbreak of war on 6 April, there were air attacks on the ships and shore installations in the Bay of Kotor, but despite near misses Zagreb was not hit by any bombs. During the days following the invasion, Zagreb and other ships were moved to different locations within the bay and camouflaged. On 16 April, the ship's crew were informed of the imminent surrender of the Yugoslav armed forces, and were ordered not to resist the enemy any further. The following day, with Italian forces closing on the Bay of Kotor, two junior officers, Milan Spasic and Sergej Masera, removed the captain and crew from the ship and set scuttling charges to prevent her capture. Both officers were killed in the explosions. Spasic's remains washed ashore on 21 April, and were given a full military funeral by Italian forces on 5 May. Masera's severed head washed up and was secretly buried by locals. The destruction of Zagreb was portrayed in the 1967 French film Flammes sur l'Adriatique Adriatic Sea of Fire , which was directed by Alexandre Astruc, and starred Gerard Barray. The film was partly filmed on location in Yugoslavia, and was released in France in 1968. In 1973, on the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Yugoslav Navy, the President of Yugoslavia and wartime Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito posthumously awarded both officers the Order of the People's Hero for their courage. In the mid 1980s, Masera's head was disinterred and forensically identified, after which it was buried at a cemetery in Ljubljana.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav%20destroyer%20Zagreb
"The Zagreb Synagogue Croatian Zagrebacka sinagoga was the main place of worship for the Jewish community of Zagreb in modern day Croatia. It was constructed in 1867 in the Kingdom of Croatia Slavonia within the Austrian Empire, and was used until it was demolished by the fascist authorities in 1941 in the Axis aligned Independent State of Croatia. The Moorish Revival synagogue, designed after the Leopoldstadter Tempel in Vienna, was located on modern day Praska Street. It has been the only purpose built Jewish house of worship in the history of the city. It was one of the city's most prominent public buildings, as well as one of the most esteemed examples of synagogue architecture in the region. Since the 1980s, plans have been made to rebuild the synagogue in its original location. Due to various political circumstances, very limited progress has been made. Major disagreements exist between the government and Jewish organizations as to how much the latter should be involved in decisions about the reconstruction project, including proposed design and character of the new building. Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first permanently settled in Zagreb in the late eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery. As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue, but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time. By 1855, the community had grown to 700 members and, on October 30 of that year, the decision was made to build a new Jewish synagogue. The construction committee, appointed in 1861, selected and purchased a parcel of land at the corner of Maria Valeria Street now Praska Street and Ban Jelacic Square, the central town square. However, a new urban planning scheme of 1864 reduced the area available for construction, and the community decided to buy another parcel of 1,540 square metres 16,600 sq ft in Maria Valeria Street, approximately 80 metres 260 ft south of the original location. Franjo Klein, a Vienna born Zagreb architect, was commissioned to build the synagogue. Klein, a representative of romantic historicism, modeled the building on the Viennese Leopoldstadter Tempel 1858 , a Moorish Revival temple designed by Ludwig Forster. It became a prototype for synagogue design in Central Europe. Zagreb Synagogue used the already developed round arch style Rundbogenstil , but did not adopt Forster's early oriental motifs. The composition of the main facade, with its dominant drawn out and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts, reflects the internal division into three naves. At ground floor level, the front was distinguished by the three arch entrance and bifora, whereas the first floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases. The synagogue occupied the greater part of the plot, facing west. It receded from the street regulation line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in AustriaHungary, prohibiting non Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street. The synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves unlike Forster's synagogue in Vienna, it did not have a basilical plan. Construction began in 1866 and was completed the following year. The synagogue was officially consecrated on September 27, 1867, a ceremony attended by representatives of city and regional authorities, Zagreb public figures, and many citizens. It was the first prominent public building in Zagreb's lower town, and its architecture and scale aroused general admiration and praise. With the new synagogue, an organ was introduced into religious service. The small minority of Orthodox Jews found this change to be intolerable, and they began to hold their services separately, in rented rooms. In the 1880 earthquake, the synagogue suffered minor damage and was repaired the following year. Largely due to immigration from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish population of Zagreb quickly grew in size from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, and then to 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate the needs of the ever growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken to increase the number of available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A central heating system was installed in 1933. During the 1941 collapse of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustasa regime. The Ustasa quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad. In October 1941, the newly installed mayor of Zagreb, Ivan Werner, issued a decree ordering the demolition of the Praska Street synagogue, ostensibly because it did not fit into the city's master plan. The demolition began on October 10, 1941, proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings it was finished by April 1942. The whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes, and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in Zagreb. It was also shown in Dubrovnik, Karlovac, Sarajevo, Vukovar and Zemun, as an illustration of the solution of the Jewish question in Croatia . A fragment of the film footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director Lordan Zafranovic during research for his 1993 documentary feature, Decline of the Century Testimony of L. Z. 41 seconds of the film survives. This footage was also shown in Mira Wolf's documentary, The Zagreb Synagogue 1867 1942 1996 , produced by Croatian Radiotelevision. The synagogue's eight valuable Torah scrolls were saved due to an intervention by Leonardo Grivicic, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile Budak, a minister in the Ustasa government. He was also close to Poglavnik Ante Pavelic and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund Glaise Horstenau. Although Grivicic did not have a significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, he learned about the regime's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning. By that evening, Grivicic secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, Gruner, and during the night, the Torah scrolls were moved to safety. Shortly after the destruction of the synagogue, the Catholic archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac delivered a homily in which he said A house of God of any faith is a holy thing, and whoever harms it will pay with their lives. In this world and the next they will be punished. . The only surviving fragments of the building the wash basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, as well as some parts of a column were saved by Ivo Kraus. He pulled them from the rubble shortly after the end of World War II. The wash basin and the memorial tables are now in the Zagreb City Museum. The column fragments are kept by the Jewish Community of Zagreb. Only one in five Croatian Jews survived the Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly one half of the surviving members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one tenth of its pre war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praska Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible. After World War II, the vacant site of the former synagogue was used as a makeshift volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day. After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb began to consider a Jewish cultural center and a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silain and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new Jewish center in Praska Street. Silain's vision was ultimately not accepted by the Jewish community instead, plans were being made for the construction of the cultural center and a synagogue, following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed. By the autumn of 1990, after the first democratic elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence 19911995 , caused the project to be put on hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue at the site of the former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when a great number of churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence. In the meantime, the Jewish Community of Zagreb sought to legally reacquire its property. The Croatian denationalization law was enacted in 1996, and the Praska Street parcel was finally returned to the community on December 31, 1999. By 2000, reconstruction activities were invigorated again. An investment study was submitted to the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb in July 2004 and revised in October 2004. The architecture competition was planned for 2005. However, a 2005 rift in the Jewish Community of Zagreb resulted in formation of a splinter Jewish community, Bet Israel, led by Ivo and Slavko Goldstein. In September 2006, the Government of Croatia formed a construction workgroup. It was decided that the project, estimated at the time at HRK 173 million US 30 million , would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the City of Zagreb, and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup. However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Praska Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions. Further disagreements existed about the design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building a replica of the original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines. In 2014 and 2015, the Jewish Community of Zagreb presented new plans for a 10,600 m2 114,000 sq ft multi purpose Jewish center and synagogue in Praska Street.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb%20Synagogue
"Zahir al Umar al Zaydani alternatively spelled Daher al Omar or Dahir al Umar Arabic Zahir al Umar az Zaydani, 1689 90 21 August 1775 was the autonomous Arab ruler of northern Palestine in the mid 18th century, while the area was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire. For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of Galilee, with successive headquarters in Tiberias, Arraba, Nazareth, Deir Hanna and finally Acre, in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid 1760s, he reestablished the port town of Haifa nearby. Zahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the Sidon and Damascus provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after. The wealth Zahir accumulated through monopolizing Palestine's cotton and olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local peasantry. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged Christian and Jewish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants from other parts of the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the Zaydani clan, also patronized the construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among Palestinians today. Zahir was born in the village of 'Arrabat al Battuf in central Galilee. His date of birth is not definitively known, with the years 1686, 1689 90 and 1694 cited by Zahir's contemporary biographers Volney, Mikha'il Sabbagh and Khalil al Muradi, respectively. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, 1689 1690 is the most likely year of his birth because he considers Sabbagh to be the most reliable source for Zahir's personal life. The proper transliteration of his given name is Zahir, but in the local dialect of Arabic used in Galilee, his name was pronounced Dahir. Zahir's family, the Zaydani clan, were Sunni Muslim notables from the Qaisi tribal confederation based in the Tiberias area who had strong connections to the Arab Bedouin tribesmen of Galilee, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire. Zahir was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh Umar al Zaydani his brothers were Sa'd, Salih Abu Dani and Yusuf, and his sister was Shammah. Zahir grew up in the village of Saffuriya. Zahir's father and grandfather had both served as the multazim chief tax collector of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs princes of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became the head of the family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that in the event of a default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan. In 1707, Zahir was involved in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al Qadir al Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir played an important role in defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local peasantry throughout the 1720s. Along with Sa'd, he also gained prestige among the people of Damascus, with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father. Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al Ghaffar al Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al Husayni family, which provided the sharifs of Damascus at the time Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to Nazareth because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune. In the late 1720s, Zahir and his brother Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, captured Tiberias and its multazim. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to Koprulu Abdullah Pasha, governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the multazim of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him multazim of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe. This was the first time a Zaydani multazim was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon. Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the multazim of al Damun, as commander of the family militia. Zahir extended his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain Jezreel Valley between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a drawn out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth a town in Safad Sanjak, but controlled by the Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland Jabal Nablus , along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid 1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000 strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer, killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al Jarrar, and captured Nazareth. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar Saqr coalition during the battle. Following his victory at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, including many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops with food and water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion. In 1738, Zahir's forces captured the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule complained that he governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500 strong force and defeated al Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict. Bi'ina, which was also fortified, withstood a siege by Zahir in 1739, but Zahir later married the daughter of Bi'ina's mukhtar headman , and thus brought Bi'ina into his domain. He also acquired the fortress of Suhmata through diplomatic means, further solidifying his rule over northern and eastern Galilee. In 1740, Zahir made an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to end their looting raids in the area. By then, Sa'd had taken control of Deir Hanna and Muhammad ibn Ali captured Shefa 'Amr, entrenching the presence of the Zaydani clan in western Galilee. After negotiations, Muhammad al Naf'i, the multazim of Safad, surrendered the city to Zahir. Safad was the administrative seat of the sanjak and situated on a strategic hill overlooking the Galilee countryside. Zahir later acquired the fortified village of Deir al Qassi after marrying the daughter of its sheikh, Abd al Khaliq Salih. Zahir's conquest of the Safad region and western Galilee removed the barriers between him and the Metawali Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, Nasif al Nassar, of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of al Bassa and Yaroun on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of Tarbikha. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in Tibnin. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon. Zahir, similar to other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not owe their power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The Ottoman Sultan sent an order to the governor of Damascus Eyalet, Sulayman Pasha al Azm, to put an end to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the Hajj pilgrim caravan. Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa 'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the wali of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and Irbid, Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in Lubya and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp. In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking Saffuriya. Zahir consolidated his authority over Acre in a drawn out process starting in the 1730s. His Acre based partner, the Melkite merchant Yusuf al Qassis, served as an early link between Zahir and the French merchants of Acre. Zahir's first contact with the merchants came in 1731 when he arranged the settlement of debts owed to them by his brother Sa'd. In 1743, To stymie his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali's ambitions in Acre, Zahir had him arrested and executed. In 1743, Zahir requested the tax farm of Acre from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al Azm, who, wary of Zahir's growing power in the province, rejected the request. Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746. In the first few years following his takeover of Acre, Zahir resided in the fortress of Deir Hanna in the heart of Galilee. He began fortifying Acre by building walls around the city in 1750. He built other fortifications and buildings in Acre as well. In 1757 he took control of the Mediterranean port villages of Haifa and Tantura, and nearby Mount Carmel, all of which had been part of Damascus Eyalet, unlike most of Zahir's domain at the time, which was in Sidon Eyalet. He also captured the port village of al Tira, between Tantura and Haifa, at that time. Zahir's stated justification to the Ottoman authorities for conquering Palestine's northern coastal plain was to protect the area from Maltese pirates. In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir maintained ties with, launched an assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte Ottoman imperial government , and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III Osman III had died on 30 October . Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year. Husayn Pasha's replacement, Uthman Pasha al Kurji, who took office in 1760, sought to retrieve control of Haifa from Zahir. Uthman Pasha requested that the governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761. The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over with the assistance of an Istanbul based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders. In 1761, Zahir ordered his son Uthman al Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him. Sa'd's assassination indirectly led to the first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa 'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa 'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa 'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and most loyal son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762. The brothers' efforts to recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and subsequently had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa for six months before exiling him to a village near Safad. Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the Haifa Bay, was built on a narrow strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel to make it easier to defend by land. In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab the Sunni leader of a Druze faction and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir Yusuf Shihab the leader of another Druze faction and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman. Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of Hasbaya culminated in a successful peace summit near Tyre between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth. In September 1767, conflict between Zahir and his son Ali al Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among his brothers and in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and Muhammad Pasha al Azm, governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over Tur'an and Hittin. Ali refused to negotiate, gained the backing of Salibi, and the two defeated their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra family disputes were put to rest for several years until 177475 , and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. In 1768 the central Ottoman authorities partially recognized or legitimized Zahir's de facto political position by granting him the title of Sheikh of Acre, Emir of Nazareth, Tiberias, Safed, and Sheikh of all Galilee . However, this official recognition was tempered when Yaqub Agha was executed shortly after and Sulayman Agha died in 1770, depriving Zahir of close allies in Istanbul. In November 1770, Uthman Pasha had the governor of Sidon replaced by his son Darwish Pasha and had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed governor of Tripoli Eyalet. Uthman Pasha was committed to ending Zahir's rule, and Zahir's position was left particularly vulnerable with the loss of support in Istanbul. In response to threats from Damascus, Zahir further strengthened Acre's fortifications and armed every adult male in the city with a rifle, two pistols and a sabre. He also moved to mend ties with his sons, who held various tax farms in Galilee, and consolidate his relationship with the Shia clans of Jabal Amil, thereby strengthening his local alliances. Although Zahir was bereft of friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new alliance with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis a vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000 20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made it as far as Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa. Zahir was surprised and angered by Ismail's reticence to attack. In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including Quneitra, while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Bani Nu'aym tribe in Hauran, also part of Damascus. In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under Abu al Dhahab in May. Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa, the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of Sidon from Darwish Pasha. However, Abu al Dhahab was persuaded by Ismail that confronting the Ottoman sultan, who carried a high religious authority as the caliph of Islam, was truly ... a scheme of the Devil and a crime against their religion. A short time after capturing Damascus, Abu al Dhahab and Ismail subsequently withdrew from the city, whose inhabitants were completely astonished at this amazing event , according to a chronicler of the time period. The sudden turn of events compelled Zahir's forces to withdraw from Sidon on 20 June. Abu al Dhahab's withdrawal frustrated Zahir who proceeded to make independent moves, first by capturing Jaffa in August 1771, after driving out its governor Ahmad Bey Tuqan, and shortly thereafter, capturing the cotton producing Bani Sa'b region centered around modern day Tulkarm , which was held by Mustafa Bey Tuqan. Zahir had Jaffa fortified and stationed 2,000 troops there. By the end of August, Zahir remained in control of Jaffa, while Uthman Pasha had restored his control over Ramla and Gaza. In an attempt to expand his zone of influence to Nablus, the commercial center of Palestine and its agriculturally rich hinterland, Zahir besieged Nablus in late 1771. By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful Jarrar clan, who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the miri hajj pilgrimage tax . Nablus was under the de facto control of the Tuqan and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated. Uthman Pasha had resumed his governorship of Damascus at the end of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached Lake Hula at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops. Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the Jordan River, the only place where they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men. The Battle of Lake Hula marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary gun salutes by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign. Following his victory against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, which he did on 13 October. He returned two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, only to have the pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte. Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain. Muhammad Tuqan captured Jaffa from Zahir in May 1772, the same month that Ali Bey arrived in Acre to seek Zahir's protection after being forced out of Egypt by rival mamluks. In June, the Ottoman loyalist Jazzar Pasha sought to establish himself in Lebanon and took over Beirut from the local Druze chieftains. The Druze had previously been in conflict with Zahir, but due to Jazzar's offensive, the circumstances fostered an alliance between them, Zahir and the Metawali clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir and Ali Bey sought to take back Jaffa and, with help from the Russian Fleet, succeeded after a nine month siege, in which they exhausted many of their resources. Prior to that, in late October 1772, Zahir and his Lebanese allies captured Beirut from Jazzar, also with Russian naval support. In March 1773, Ali Bey left Palestine to reestablish himself in Egypt, but Abu al Dhahab had him killed when he arrived there. With this came an end to the alliance between Zahir and Ali Bey, which had brought together Egypt and Palestine politically and economically in a way that had not occurred since the early 16th century. While their attempts to unite their territories economically and politically were unsuccessful, their rule posed the most serious domestic challenge to Ottoman rule in the 18th century. As a consequence of Ali Bey's death, Zahir moved to further strengthen his hold over Jaffa and capture Jerusalem, but he failed in the latter attempt. All of Ottoman Syria came under the official command of Uthman Pasha al Misri in 1774 in order to bring stability to the provinces of the region. Al Misri did not seek conflict with Zahir and sought to establish friendly terms with him. As such, he convinced the Sublime Porte to officially appoint Zahir as the governor of Sidon as long as Zahir paid all of the taxes the province had owed to the Porte. Al Misri further promoted Zahir in February by declaring him Governor of Sidon, Nablus, Gaza, Ramla, Jaffa and Jabal Ajlun , although this title was not officially sanctioned by the Porte. In effect, Zahir was the de facto ruler over Palestine with the exception of Nablus and Jerusalem , Jabal Amil, and the Syrian coast from Gaza to Beirut. Al Misri was recalled to Istanbul in the summer of 1774 and Muhammad Pasha al Azm was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al Misri. Al Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made peace with Russia and relieving itself from that conflict, aimed to undermine the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al Azm managed to secure an official pardon of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id, later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id. Ali continued to undermine Zahir's rule by encouraging defections by Zahir's Maghrebi mercenaries through bribes. On 20 May 1775, Abu al Dhahab, having been encouraged by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al Ifranj the French Caravanserai for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon. Ali al Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later. They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil. Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re entered the city two days later and reestablished order with the assistance of Ahmad Agha al Dinkizli. However, the setback of Abu al Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands. On 23 April, the Porte dispatched the Ottoman Navy admiral, Hasan Pasha al Jazayiri, to blockade Acre. He reached Haifa on 7 August taking Jaffa from Zahir's son in law, Karim al Ayyubi. Hasan Pasha ordered Zahir to pay the miri dues he owed to the Sublime Porte dating back to 1768. Zahir initially agreed to pay 500,000 piasters of the total amount upfront and a further 50,000 piasters to Hasan Pasha himself to spare the blood of the people . Hasan Pasha apparently accepted Zahir's proposals, but the arrangements fell apart. The accounts differ as to exactly how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result of disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships. Hasan proceeded to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning fire from the city's artillerymen al Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long time deputy commander's betrayal, Zahir attempted to flee Acre on 21 or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul. Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih were arrested by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized property belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital along with their physician, who was known to be talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan. Zahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali continued to put up resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan Selim III as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when Napoleon invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being defeated in Acre, Abbas and Salih both left Safad with the departing French forces. This marked the end of Zaydani influence in Galilee. Constantin Francois Volney, who wrote the first European biography of Zahir in 1787, lists three main reasons for Zahir's failure. First, the lack of internal good order and justness of principle . Secondly, the early concessions he made to his children. Third, and most of all, the avarice of his adviser and confidant, Ibrahim Sabbagh. Zahir appointed many of his brothers and sons as local administrators, particularly after he consolidated his control over Acre, which became the capital of his territory. Except for Acre and Haifa, Zahir divided the remainder of his territory between his relatives. His eldest brother was appointed to Deir Hanna, and his younger brothers Yusuf and Salih Abu Dani were installed in I'billin and Arraba, respectively. Zahir appointed his eldest son Salibi as the multazim of Tiberias. Salibi was killed in 1773 fighting alongside Ali Bey's forces in Egypt. His death deeply distressed Zahir, who was around 80 years old at the time. He appointed Uthman in Kafr Kanna then Shefa 'Amr, Abbas in Nazareth, Ali in Safad, and Ahmad in Saffuriya. Ahmad replaced Salibi in Tiberias as well, and also conquered Ajlun and Salt in Transjordan. In addition, Ahmad was given authority over Deir Hanna after Sa'd's death. Zahir appointed his nephew Ayyub al Karimi in Jaffa and Gaza, while al Dinkizli was made multazim in Sidon in 1774. The appointment of Zahir's relatives and close associates was meant to ensure the efficient administration of his expanding realm and the loyalty of his circle. Among their chief functions was to ensure the supply of cotton to Acre. It is not clear if these posts were recognized by the Ottoman government. Zahir had an aide who jointly served in the capacity of mudabbir manager and wazir vizier to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence. This official had always been a Melkite local Greek Catholic . His first wazir was Yusuf al Arqash, followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to Malta. He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh, who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local Greek Orthodox Christian and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite. Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in Damietta, Egypt. Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials. There were other officials in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the mufti and the qadi. The mufti was the chief scholar among the ulama Muslim scholarly community and oversaw the interpretation of Islamic law in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same mufti for many years at a time in contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its mufti replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the qadi from Palestine's local ulama, but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the qadi of Sidon. Zahir had a chief imam, who in the last years of his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al Shaabi. An agha was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa. Zahir's initial military forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen and the local inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of the remainder of his rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the two principal conditions Zahir established to foster his sheikhdom's prosperity and its survival were security and justice . Prior to Zahir's consolidation of power, the villages of northern Palestine were prone to Bedouin raids and robberies and the roads were under constant threat from highway robbers and Bedouin attacks. Although following the looting raids, the inhabitants of these agrarian villages were left destitute, the Ottoman provincial government would nonetheless attempt to collect from them the miri hajj tax . To avoid punitive measures for not paying the miri, the inhabitants would abandon their villages for safety in the larger towns or the desert. This situation hurt the economy of the region as the raids sharply reduced the villages' agricultural output, the government appointed mutasallims tax farmers could not collect their impositions, and trade could not be safely conducted due to insecurity on the roads. By 1746, however, Zahir had established order in the lands he ruled. He managed to co opt the dominant Bedouin tribe of the region, the Bani Saqr, which greatly contributed to the establishment of security in northern Palestine. Moreover, Zahir charged the sheikhs of the towns and villages of northern Palestine with ensuring the safety of the roads in their respective vicinity and required them to compensate anyone who was robbed of his her property. General security reached a level whereby an old woman with gold in her hand could travel from one place to another without fear or danger , according to biographer Mikhail Sabbagh. This period of calm that persisted between 1744 and 1765 greatly boosted the security and economy of Galilee. The security established in the region encouraged people from other parts of the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Galilee. Conflict between the local clans and between Zahir and his sons remained limited to periodic clashes, while there were no attacks against Zahir's domain from outside forces. While Zahir used force to strengthen his position in the region, the local inhabitants generally took comfort in his rule, which historian Thomas Philip described as relatively just and reasonably fair . According to Richard Pococke who visited the area in 1737, the local people had great admiration for Zahir, especially for his war against bandits on the roads. In addition to providing security, Zahir and his local deputies adopted a policy of aiding the peasants cultivate and harvest their farmlands to further guarantee the steady supply of agricultural products for export. These benefits included loans to peasants and the distribution of free seeds. Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor. This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands. Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for outstanding payments the peasants owed to merchants from credit based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment. According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level. He regularly paid the Ottoman authorities their financial dues, ensuring a degree of stability in his relationship with the sultanate. When Zahir conquered Acre, he transformed it from a decaying village into a fortified market hub for Palestinian products, including silk, wheat, olive oil, tobacco and cotton, which he exported to Europe. With cotton in particular, Zahir was able to monopolize the market for it and its foreign export. He did business with European merchants based in Galilee's ports, who competed with one another for the cotton and grain cultivated in the rural villages under Zahir's dominion or influence in Galilee's hinterland and Jabal Amil. Previously, European merchants made direct transactions with local cotton growers, but Zahir, with the help of Ibrahim Sabbagh, put an end to this system of commerce by making himself the middleman between the merchants and the growers living under his rule. This allowed him to both monopolize cotton production and the merchants' price for the product. Zahir's designation of prices for the local cash crops also prevented exploitation of the peasants and local merchants by European merchants and their manipulation of the prices , according to Joudah. This caused financial losses to the European merchants who lodged numerous complaints to the French and English ambassadors to the Sublime Porte. A formal agreement to regulate commerce between Zahir and the European merchants was reached in 1753. Zahir further encouraged trade by offering local merchants interest free loans. The high European demand for the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his autonomous sheikhdom. This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order to benefit from the customs fees he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom as a result of its position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom. Zahir maintained tolerant policies and encouraged the involvement of religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742, along with Muslims. Zahir did not consider Jews to be a threat to his rule and believed that their connections with the Jewish diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area. The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna. Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa 'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule. Zahir encouraged local Christian settlement in Acre, in order to contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries. Zahir allowed the Franciscan community of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with Jesus's life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth, and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest church in the city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As a testament to the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built under the auspices of Zahir's less tolerant successors. A strong relationship existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs and merchant class. Zahir maintained law and order in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skills. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their successful conflict with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab clan under Mulhim Shihab, . The relationship between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of Chouf allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the Tripoli region remained supportive of the Ottomans. Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze emirs of Mount Lebanon, he Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the oral traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned and there was a partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River. Zahir's clan belonged to the Qaisi political faction in the centuries long struggle between the Qais and Yaman confederations. The Ma'an and Shihab dynasties, who ruled Mount Lebanon and often Galilee semi autonomously, also belonged to the Qaisi faction. For the most part, Zahir respected the socio political system that prevailed in the region he ruled. The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan. Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables. Zahir had five wives during his lifetime. Among his wives was a woman from the Sardiyah, a Bedouin tribe active in Transjordan and Palestine. Zahir was also married to a daughter of Sayyid Muhammad, a wealthy religious notable from Damascus, a daughter of the mukhtar headman of Bi'ina, and a daughter of the mukhtar of Deir al Qassi. Zahir had eight sons from his wives, and according to Tobias Smollett, a daughter as well. His sons, from eldest to youngest, were Salibi, Ali, Uthman, Sa'id, Ahmad, Salih, Sa'd al Din and Abbas. His daughter's husband's name was Karim al Ayyubi, who was also Zahir's cousin. By 1773, Zahir had a total of 272 children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. As Zahir consolidated his power and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other in order to secure their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power. Zahir's rule radically changed the landscape of Galilee. With the restoration and re fortification of Acre and the establishment of the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture. In the late 19th century, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Claude Reignier Conder wrote that the Ottomans had successfully destroyed the power of Palestine's indigenous ruling families who had practically been their own masters but had been ruined so that there is no longer any spirit left in them . Among these families were the proud race of Zahir, which was still held in high esteem, but was powerless and poor. Zahir's modern day descendants in Galilee use the surname Dhawahri or al Zawahirah in Zahir's honor. The Dhawahri clan constitute one of the traditional elite Muslim clans of Nazareth, alongside the Fahum, Zu'bi and 'Onallas families. Other villages in Galilee where descendants of Zahir's clan live are Bi'ina and Kafr Manda and, prior to its 1948 destruction, al Damun. Many of the inhabitants of modern day northern Israel, particularly the towns and villages where Zahir or his family left an architectural legacy, hold Zahir in high regard. Although he was mostly overlooked by historians of the Middle East, some scholars view Zahir's rule as a forerunner to Palestinian nationalism. Among these scholars is Karl Sabbagh, who asserts the latter view in his book Palestine A Personal History, which was widely reviewed in the British press in 2010. Zahir was gradually integrated into Palestinian historiography. In Murad Mustafa Dabbagh's Biladuna Filastin 1965 , a multi volume work about Palestine's history, Zahir is referred to as the greatest Palestinian appearing in the eighteenth century . The Palestine Liberation Organization PLO radio station, Voice of Palestine, broadcast a series about Zahir in 1966, praising him as a Palestinian national hero who fought against Ottoman imperialism. Zahir is considered by many Arab nationalists as a pioneer of Arab liberation from foreign occupation. According to Joudah However historians may look at Shaykh Zahir al 'Umar and his movement, he is highly respected by the Arabs of the East. In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has elevated Zahir and his legacy to near iconic status. These re readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the Nakba. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a little Kingdom, as Albert Hourani called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century. Zahir and his family built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and khans caravanserais . These buildings improved the domestic administration and general security of Galilee. Today, many of these structures are in a state of disrepair and remain outside the scope of Israel's cultural preservation laws. In Acre, Zahir rebuilt the Crusader era walls and built on top of various Crusader and Mamluk structures in the city. Among these were the caravanserais of Khan al Shawarda and its Burj al Sultan tower and Khan al Shunah. In 1758, he commissioned the construction of the al Muallaq Mosque, He also built the Seraya government house in Nazareth, which served as that city's municipal headquarters until 1991. In Haifa, which Zahir founded, he built a wall with four towers and two gates around the new settlement. Within Haifa, he built the Burj al Salam fortress, a small mosque, a customs building, and a government residence saraya . In Tiberias, he commissioned the building of a citadel now ruined and the al Amari Mosque. The latter was built with alternating white and black stone, typical of the architectural style of Zahir's building works, and a minaret. Fortifications and other structures were built in the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress with the addition of a mosque and hamaam bathhouse . The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab Israeli War. In Shefa 'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya. In Tibnin, in modern day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader era fortresses rebuilt. Zahir fortified the village of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century. At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained standing by the 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest of its kind in Galilee. In the village of I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th century semi autonomous Arab sheikh of Galilee.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahir%20al-Umar
"M.Ed. from Indiana University of Pennsylvania Gerald L. Zahorchak is an American educator and the former Secretary of Education for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, a position he held from 2006 to 2010. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zahorchak worked at various Pennsylvania public school districts in a number of positions, including teacher, football coach, principal, federal programs director, strategic planning coordinator and personnel director. Zahorchak worked as superintendent of the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County from 1997 to 2003, when he was chosen to be Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education for the state. Governor Ed Rendell appointed him Secretary of Education in 2005. During his tenure as secretary, Zahorchak implemented state funding for pre kindergarten and full day kindergarten, developed a new school funding formula, helped increase education funding for school districts, and established the Keystone Exams and the state's Standards Aligned System. In 2010, Zahorchak announced he would leave the Secretary of Education position, coinciding with Rendell's pending departure from the governorship. On April 22, 2010, Zahorchak was selected to be superintendent of the Allentown School District in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he vowed to establish regular updates to families about their students education, improve safety in schools and implement incentives to attract qualified minorities and top education students into teaching positions. A native of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Zahorchak received a bachelor's degree master in 1980 from Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, and a master of education degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986. In 1994, Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on state policy making. Zahorchak began his educational career in 1980 at the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, where he spent two years an elementary school teacher. In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the North Star School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at North Star until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his three years in the district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director. In 1992, he returned to the North Star School District as a principal and strategic planning coordinator. Zahorchak also previously served as an elected member of the Greater Johnstown School Board, and was a Johnstown city councilman, the Johnston deputy major and president of the Johnstown Rotary in 2003. Zahorchak returned to the Greater Johnstown School District in 1996 as a federal programs and personnel director. In 1997, he was promoted to superintendent, a position he held for six years. During his tenure as superintendent, Zahorchak implemented full day kindergarten, pre kindergarten and tutoring programs. He also pursued high school reform and hired reading and math coaches to boost student learning. In March 2003, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Vicki Phillips hired Zahorchak as Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, where he oversaw the education of more than 1.8 million children public school children in the state. Zahorchak helped implement the release of Pennsylvania's first Academic Achievement Reports, and led the development and implementation of support systems for public schools trying to meet No Child Left Behind targets. By 2005, Zahorchak was making a yearly salary of 124,458. Zahorchak served as acting education secretary from August 2004, when Phillips left the position, to September 2004, when Francis Barnes was hired. During the Barnes administration, Governor Ed Rendell encouraged local Pennsylvania school boards to participate in Act 72, a state property tax relief program. Act 72 used proceeds from slot machine gambling to finance property tax cuts from homeowners, and included with spending restrictions in exchange for the tax cuts. Barnes himself did not support the program, and most school boards rejected it because of the spending restrictions. Zahorchak, however voiced support for Act 72 and helped Rendell lobby local school districts to support it, which increased his visibility statewide. Zahorchak claimed Act 72 includes real property tax relief that shifts more of the responsibility for school funding back to the state . When Barnes resigned in September 2005, Zahorchak was again tapped to serve as acting secretary and was widely considered the most qualified candidate for the permanent position, although Governor Ed Rendell engaged in a thorough search for other potential candidates around the state. Zahorchak was appointed state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor Ed Rendell, following the resignation of former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's 44 million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks for businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the full senate unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006. Zahorchak was a steady supporter of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained that he could still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, I happen to agree with the outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions. In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level. However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams. As secretary, Zahorchak implemented state funding for pre kindergarten and full day kindergarten, training for principals, and easier ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed 200 million in Accountability Block Grants that were used for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet the specific needs of individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by 2.6 billion over the next six years, starting with an additional 291 million in 200809, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to 274 million. Zahorchak spearheaded the establishment of the Keystone Exams, state created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form. In December 2009, Zahorchak received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, making him one of about only 50 people to receive the distinction. In 2010, Zahorchak helped lead the application for federal funding through Race to the Top, a competitive grant program that encourages innovation and reform throughout public education. Zahorchak said the plan he drafted would double the number of students meeting math and reading proficiency targets by 2014. About 120 school districts and 59 charter schools representing roughly 650,000 students signed on for the application, which could have brought the state 400 million. However, Pennsylvania was not included among the states to receive money in the first round of Race to the Top, where funds were awarded only to Delaware and Tennessee for their reform measures. Zahorchak said feedback from the rejected application would be used to strengthen another application in the second round. Zahorchak announced he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was spurred by the pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At the time of his departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job. Robert Smith, AllentownSchool District director Zahorchak was unanimously selected to be superintendent of the Allentown School District in Allentown, Pennsylvania on April 22, 2010. His five year contract began on July 1, 2010, with a starting yearly salary of 195,000. Zahorchak is the 16th superintendent of the district, which serves about 18,300 students and is the fourth largest public school district in Pennsylvania. He was chosen over four potential candidates, including former Harrisburg School District Superintendent Gerald Kohn, deputy superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools Carlinda Purcell and School District of Philadelphia Regional Superintendent Lucy D. Feria. The Allentown position was the only job Zahorchak sought as he considered leaving the Secretary of Education position. Zahorchak said he plans to install a system that would provide regular updates to families on the academic performance of their children and push them toward tangible improvement goals. In response to recent student violence problems at the William Allen High School, Zahorchak identified one of his priorities as strengthening the district's code of conduct and citizenship programs. He also announced he would seek to replace retiring teachers with highly skilled minority candidates, and would create incentive programs to lure top students into teaching positions if they agreed to spend at least five years teaching in Allentown schools. Shortly after it was announced that all four Allentown School District middle schools failed to meet PSSA standards in 2009 10, Zahorchak proposed a major overhaul that would effectively eliminate all the district's middle schools and change elementary schools to a kindergarten through eighth grade model. On August 26, 2010, the school board approved a study of the district's facilities which would look into that proposal, or an alternative of building a fifth middle school in East Allentown to reduce the district's middle school student population per building. The Morning Call said if approved, Zahorchak's proposal would be the biggest overhaul of the city's educational landscape in 30 years . On October 14, the Allentown School Board Education Committee signed off on Zahorchak's proposed five year leadership and curriculum plans Pathways to Success . The full board will determine whether to adopt it on October 28. Among the elements of the plan were social supports to help students transition from one grade level to the next, as well as the introduction to students of college information and career choices as early as elementary school, to ensure they understand their options after high school. The plan would also align programs and curricula across the district, establish a network to provide students better access to college courses and tutoring, and a push for more students to take advanced placement courses. Additionally, the plan would require high schoolers to pass mandatory, internationally recognized exit exams to graduate from high school. The committee signed off on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to 15 million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes as a condition for receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public. On March 24, Zahorchak's proposal for district wide reform will be put before the Allentown School Board. The plan for reform is based primarily on financial expectations within the district. While the plan calls for the hiring of new teachers who will not be full time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300 teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan. By July 1, 2011, the school board approved a budget that saw less than 60 professionals educators being furloughed. The budget continued to endorse the Pathways to Success Program. On August 17, 2011, Zahorchak resigned as superintendent and was retained as Director of Strategic Initiatives. Cost savings was cited by the ASD board as the reason for the resignation. Other issues with Zahorchak's management style, initiatives, and actions were also reported as contributing to the mutually accepted resignation.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%20Zahorchak
"Zaion I Wish You Were Here Japanese , Hepburn Anata ga koko ni Itehoshii is a four episode Japanese science fiction original net animation ONA released by Gonzo in 2001. The story is set in the near future, when Earth is threatened by a spaceborne virus that turns humans into violent creatures and enhanced soldiers are fighting a war against the creatures in order to ensure the survival of the human race. The series was directed by Seiji Mizushima and written by Natsuko Takahashi. Music for the series was composed by Kenji Kawai. Zaion was licensed for an English language release in North America by ADV Films. In the year 2000, the CDC discovers a meteorite borne virus known as M34 that alters the molecular structure of the human body and turns its victims into violent creatures. In 2002, the World Health Organization establishes an internal organization called the Committee of the Universal Resolution of Ecocatastrophe CURE , with several international branches, in order to eradicate the virus, which has infected three percent of the human population. CURE creates an elite unit of soldiers called NOA , an acronym for the Nano Osmolar Armor they wear, and units of unmanned robots called Multi purpose Operative Beings MOB that assist NOA in the field. CURE's branches also begin secret work on special superhuman weapons, codenamed UNIT and each given an alphabetic suffix. In 2004, as the missions begin to take their toll on NOA's ranks, NOA soldier Yuuji Tamiya , Tamiya Yuji voiced by Joe Odagiri in Japanese and Joey Hood in English becomes angry when he learns of CURE's Japanese branch's UNIT project, known as UNIT i, and that they're not using it. UNIT i is a girl named Ai voiced by Yukari Tamura in Japanese and Christa Kimlicko Jones in English who is able to create a projected being that can destroy the creatures. During the next outbreak, several victims of the virus fuse together into a larger creature that overwhelms the NOA soldiers. CURE decides to put Ai's ability to the test, and the projected being destroys the creature. Yuuji is quarantined after coming into contact with one of the creatures, but is released when he recovers from his injuries. However, his blood tests later indicate that the virus has evolved and is attacking the nanomachines in his body. CURE orders Yuuji's arrest, but he escapes and takes Ai hostage. When his condition worsens during their journey, Ai heals him with her powers. Other NOA soldiers catch up with Yuuji and Ai and help them escape, but they are soon found by CURE units and are taken to the NOA facility. At the NOA facility, the NOA soldiers become victims of the virus as their nanomachines are destroyed. Yuuji is forced to fight them and the CURE units at the same time. Ai uses her powers to eliminate all traces of the virus in the facility, curing the infected NOA soldiers. A larger outbreak occurs elsewhere in the city, and the virus further evolves to mimic the nanomachines' abilities. Yuuji delays the creatures' advance as Ai creates the projected being and uses all of her power to purge the infected area of the virus. Yuuji and Ai are later discharged from CURE and spend time together, free from their duties at last. The first episode of Zaion was published on the Internet on October 4, 2001. The first two episodes aired later that day on the Kids Station television network. The network aired the final episodes of the series on November 3, 2001. The ending theme song for the series is Lunatic Trance Shizuka naru Zekkyo Lunatic Trance , which was released as a maxi single on November 21, 2001. The song was later included in Gonzo's compilation release of music from its anime works in 2006. The series did not have an opening theme. Each monthly episode of Zaion was released on DVD by the Japanese distributor, Media Factory. The first episode was released on February 22, 2002, and the final episode was released on May 31, 2002. ADV Films licensed the series for the English language and released the episodes in pairs in 2003. It then repackaged the series into one set, released on February 3, 2009. Madman Entertainment licensed Zaion for distribution in Australia and New Zealand and released its boxed set on July 26, 2006. Zaion I Wish You Were Here had a mixed reception. Patrick King of Animefringe wrote, On the surface, it may appear to be merely another sci fi mecha action show. However, Zaion introduced apocalyptic themes similar to those found in Michael Crichton's novel Andromeda Strain and the film 28 Days Later . According to King, the real story of Zaion occurs when Yuuji and Ai develop their relationship, and we begin to think less of the nanomachine technology and viral invasion of the planet and focus more upon the potential love between these two lonely people, trapped in a labyrinth devoid of an exit . The series was produced with high audio and visual qualities, and was designed with plausible technical details . King also praised the fitting soundtrack, which was composed by Kenji Kawai and incorporated the sounds of progressive rock. On the contrary, Jason Bustard of THEM Anime rated the series one out of five stars and accused Gonzo of attempting to rip off Power Rangers as a last resort . He also pointed out the seemingly oblivious general population of the world in Zaion, which is not at all concerned about the invasion. If they were trying for some sort of grand social statement here, they succeeded instead in making the vast majority of Japan simply look stupid , Bustard charged. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also rated Zaion below average. Although he criticized the series as a woefully undercooked and dull bit of science fiction claptrap , he also admitted that it wouldn't be quite so miserable if the design wasn't as poorly handled as it is . Gonzo, which was known for incorporating experimental animation into its productions, mismanaged the show's 3D computer animation and produced a result that could have been rendered many years ago in some ancient MS DOS modeling program . Despite his criticisms, Bertschy called the soundtrack a truck stop of pleasure on the highway of pain , and praised the professional English language dub released by ADV Films. Mania's Chris Beveridge noted that character development between Yuuji and Ai was not consistent. Yuuji comes across as little more than a blank sheet for the most part with just the scribble of angst on him , Beveridge observed. Overall, Gonzo's experimentation with computer animation look highly fake and out of place .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaion%3A%20I%20Wish%20You%20Were%20Here
"Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by American rock band The Flaming Lips, released on October 28, 1997 by Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of four Compact Discs designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, they would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound the discs could also be played in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and Eureka literally I have found it , an expression of joyous discovery. Zaireeka was the first album by the band since the departure of guitarist Ronald Jones. It acted as a preview of the music and style that would surface on the next album The Soft Bulletin 1999 , which was recorded during the same sessions as Zaireeka, and is the predecessor to the band's more conventional surround sound releases. Adverse circumstances led to the production of Zaireeka. The departure of guitarist Ronald Jones compelled the band to change fundamentally. In addition, the limited success of the previous album, Clouds Taste Metallic, threatened their status at Warner Bros. Records. They eventually found that drummer Steven Drozd could compensate for the loss of Jones by becoming a multi instrumentalist. However, live shows proved to be more challenging and in order to maintain activity and output, Wayne Coyne conceived an experimental show. During 1996 and 1997, The Flaming Lips ran a series of events known as The Parking Lot Experiments . The concept was inspired by an incident in Coyne's youth, where he noticed that car radios in the parking lot at a concert were playing the same songs at the same time, Wayne Coyne created 40 cassette tapes to be played in synchronization. The band invited people to bring their cars to parking lots, where they would be given one of the tapes and then instructed when to start them. The music was a strange, fluid 20 minute sound composition . Production of the album was preceded by two unfortunate events, which were recounted in The Spiderbite Song from The Soft Bulletin. Michael Ivins was involved in a car crash, and Steven Drozd's hand became severely infected. Drozd initially claimed that his hand had been bitten by a spider, although later he admitted the infected abscess was caused by injection of heroin. The Flaming Lips began work on Zaireeka in April 1997 in the then new Tarbox Road Studios. Initially, the band was frustrated while making the album. Even after diverting half of the budget for the next album into Zaireeka, there were no tangible results. The band experienced difficulty writing songs for the album. Finally, Coyne exclaimed, Look, we don't have to be friends... but we have to make this record While this philosophy aided progress, the band only began to complete songs when they learned to write for the medium as opposed to trying to split normal songs across four CDs. The group wrote several songs that were unsuccessful in the four CD format. These songs, including Race for the Prize , were reserved for the next album, which would eventually become The Soft Bulletin. Warner Bros. Records was initially apprehensive about releasing Zaireeka, so manager Scott Booker carefully researched the costs of releasing a box set. Booker discovered that Zaireeka could be released so that once 12,000 copies had been sold, the label would break even. Advance orders for the album came to 14,000 copies. Booker pitched the album to Warner Bros. Records president Steven Baker. Eventually, the two factions reached an agreement in which the album would be released, although Zaireeka would not count towards the seven albums the band was contracted to deliver to Warner Bros. For an advance of 200,000, the band would make both Zaireeka and The Soft Bulletin. In addition, Booker mentioned that by allowing the media to proclaim how weird the band was with Zaireeka, they would be more prepared to treat The Soft Bulletin as a serious album. Zaireeka was released in October, 1997. As of 2006 , 28,000 copies have been sold. The speakers being used may be physically positioned in many different configurations e.g. at different heights or even in entirely different rooms . Some listeners may even choose to disable the left or right speaker of one or more systems. Synchronization errors between the audio systems may cause effects such as reverb or echo being heard on one disc before the original sound is produced from another. Further, the type and quality of each audio system affect the relationship between the four CDs. After completion of Zaireeka, The Flaming Lips tried an unconventional method to tour the album. The Boom Box Experiments , like The Parking Lot Experiments , involved tapes being played at the same time. However, these shows were held in conventional rock venues, and the band supplied their own boom boxes. Coyne and Drozd conducted two choirs of people controlling the boom boxes, giving them instructions for actions like turning the volume up or down, while Ivins controlled the mixer. Songs played in The Boom Box Experiments include Wayne Coyne, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots 5.1 liner notes With Zaireeka, The Flaming Lips had overcome the loss of Ronald Jones and proved they could still work as a band. The situation at Warner Bros. Records was still dire, including a risk of being dropped from the label. However, songs had already been written for the next album, The Soft Bulletin, which would be both a critical hit for the band and their breakthrough into mainstream success. Following the release of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots in 2002, The Flaming Lips would return to the concept of surround sound with a DVD Audio special edition of that album in 2003. Zaireeka is viewed by the band as nothing more than an experimental release. It was, and still is, intended to be listened to by other artists, musicians and producers, Coyne would later state in the liner notes for The Soft Bulletin 5.1, adding that they never expected the less involved members of our audience to care about it. As noted above, there was no conventional concert tour to promote Zaireeka, and only two of its eight songs have ever been played live. Riding to Work in the Year 2025 Your Invisible Now was played on the tour supporting The Soft Bulletin and also on the Lips 2007 and 2013 tours, whilst How Will We Know Futuristic Crashendos was played a total of twelve times in 2000 and 2002. Zaireeka opens with Okay I'll Admit That I Really Don't Understand , a mantra of sorts about the admitted lack of comprehension regarding one's situation. The second track, Riding to Work in the Year 2025 Your Invisible Now tells a science fiction story about a man who pretends to be a secret agent in the future and imagines his own psychological demise from the stress of being the most important secret agent in the world . Thirty Five Thousand Feet of Despair , the third song, is the tragic story of an airplane pilot who somehow hangs himself mid flight. The next song, A Machine in India , is about the dull and depressing, mild insanity that the speaker's partner slips into during her menstrual cycle. Next, The Train Runs over the Camel but Is Derailed by the Gnat , is a speech by a man who is on the verge of discovery, but ends up talking himself into circles . Track six, How Will We Know Futuristic Crashendos , is based on an urban legend that being exposed to high and low frequencies can cause a person to experience premonitions, and thus contains its infamously extensive frequencies that caused the band to place a warning on the album cover and inside the booklet. The seventh song, March of the Rotten Vegetables , is music for a cartoon about a group of demented vegetables . The eighth and final song, The Big Ol' Bug Is the New Baby Now , contains a spoken word story about Coyne's dogs the track ends the album with loud barking from each disc. On the 10th anniversary of Zaireeka, Wayne Coyne made and distributed an additional 5th disc to go along with the set. Critical reaction to Zaireeka was polarized. Josh Kun of Rolling Stone wrote that the album's wall of surround sound approach melds droning rock dissonance with warped, off kilter pop melodies, producing a totally immersing post Pet Sounds audio seance. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic stated that the album would only really be accessible to hardcore Flaming Lips fans, but that they're in for the musical experience of a lifetime . Critics who disliked the album cited what they viewed as a ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that Musically ... their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same psychotic results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually The same thing, just all at once stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10 in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor in chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1 3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles the creation of the album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchfork's 2010 list of ten unusual CD era gimmicks . Wayne Coyne confirmed that Zaireeka will eventually be released on DVD format in the vein of the surround sound special editions of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, The Soft Bulletin, and At War with the Mystics. In the UK, the Race for the Prize and Waitin' for a Superman CD singles were released in 2 disc sets. Each disc of the two sets contained a different version of Riding to Work in the Year 2025 Your Invisible Now and Thirty Five Thousand Feet of Despair . This marked the first time material from the album would be released in the four disc format in Europe. The Waitin' for a Superman Maxi CD, as released in the US, contains stereo mixes of the two songs. The album was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day 2013. All four discs have identical track listings. All tracks are written by The Flaming Lips. The Flaming Lips Technical",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaireeka
"Prince Jozef Zajaczek 1 November 1752, Kamieniec Podolski 28 August 1826, Warsaw was a Polish general and politician. Zajaczek started his career in the Army of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, an aide de camp to hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki. He was Branicki's supporter on the political scene, before joining the liberal opposition during the Great Sejm in 1790. He became a radical supporter of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. As a military commander, in the rank of a general, he participated in PolishRussian War of 1792 and Kosciuszko Uprising. After the partitions of Poland, he joined the Napoleonic Army, and was a general in Napoleon's forces until his wounding and capture during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. From 1815 he became involved in the governance of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, becoming the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland. Jozef Zajaczek was born on 1 November 1752 in Kamieniec Podolski to Antoni Zajaczek and Marianna Cieszkowska, members of the Polish noble family of the Swinka. Young Zajaczek probably attended a school in Zamosc, and later a Jesuit school in Warsaw. At the age of sixteen he joined the Bar Confederates, and served as a secretary to Micha Wielhorski, accompanying him on his diplomatic mission to Paris, France, in 1770. Zajaczek stayed in Paris for several years, and in 1773 he met one of the major leaders of the Confederacy, Casimir Pulaski. Falling under Pulaski's influence, he left Wielhorski's service, and accompanied Pulaski on his diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Empire in 1774, where he witnessed the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Kozludzha on 20 June. Returning to France later that year he wrote a hagiographic biography of Pulaski in French. In 1775 he got an officer junior lieutenant position in the hussar regiment of the French Army, although after several weeks he abandoned this position to return to Poland. Thanks to the support from the magnate Sapieha family he received a post of an aide de camp to hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki. Zajaczek participated as a deputy from the Podole Voivodeship in the Sejm parliament of the Commonwealth session of 1784, and was a vocal member of the hetman Branicki's faction known as the Hetmans' Party . In a similar vein he participated in the Sejm of 1786, this time as a deputy from the Kiev Voivodeship. During that time he emerged as a vocal critic of king Stanisaw August Poniatowski. In late 1786 he married Aleksandra Iaura, nee de Pernet. Meanwhile, he kept being promoted in ranks, reaching that of colonel in 1787. He was also not a deputy to the first half of the Four year Sejm 17881792 , and spent the first two years of its deliberations with his unit 2nd Front Guard Regiment, Polish 2 regiment strazy przedniej on the Ukrainian border in 1790, however, he was elected as a deputy once again and joined his patron Branicki in Warsaw. Soon, however, he left Branicki's camp, joining the faction of Hugo Koataj, the Patriotic Party. Zajaczek became involved in the works of a commission tasked with reforming the Polish military, and contributed to a new project on military exercises and officer training. He became one of the supporters of the new Constitution of 3 May 1791, and members of the Friends of the Constitution society. Displeased with reforms in Poland that were threatening its influence there, Russia invaded Poland in May 1792, starting the PolishRussian War of 1792. Two weeks before the war started, on May 4 Zajaczek became the commander of the 3rd Front Guard Regiment 3 regiment strazy przedniej . On May 26 he was given command over a reserve corps, and on 29 May he was promoted to the rank of major general. After gathering some troops near Lublin, he departed towards Dubno, which he reached on 7 June. He was one of the Polish commanders at the victorius battle of Zielence, for which he received the highest decoration of the Polish military, Virtuti Militari, becoming the fifth person to receive this award, instituted just that year. He took part in some minor skirmishes, but did not participate in any significant battle before Stanisaw August Poniatowski surrendered to the enemy, joining the Targowica Confederation. The war ended without any decisive battles, with the Polish army still in the fighting condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. Angered at the king's betrayal, Zajaczek was one of the main proponents of the plan to kidnap the king the plan, however, never came to fruition. Like many other dissatisfied officers, including Prince Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, Zajaczek requested a discharge from the army his resignation was accepted on 18 August. Shortly afterward Zajaczek left the country, heading to Vienna. In August 1793 he moved to Leipzig, joining a number of other Polish emigres, namely Kosciuszko and Kolataj, preparing for a new war. Soon he became one of the major planners of this approaching conflict, often tasked with delivering important messages to Poland, and collecting information there in particular he was active in Warsaw, and Kosciuszko planned for him to become a commander of that region. Zajaczek also went on missions to Dresden and Paris. During that time, he became known as a radical revolutionary, democrat and proponent of abolishing serfdom in Poland. In April he joined the club of Polish Jacobins . Shortly after the Kosciuszko Uprising began in March 1794, Zajaczek joined Kosciuszko in Luborzyca on 2 April. Zajaczek was given the command of the Lesser Poland Division, and on 4 April he took part in battle of Racawice, which concluded with a major Polish victory. On 6 April he was promoted to lieutenant general. Over the next few weeks Zajaczek accompanied Kosciuszko and his staff. On 8 June he was defeated at the battle of Chem and retreated toward Lublin. He lost support among the troops, and faced a mutiny, eventually quelled by Kosciuszko, on 10 June. In mid June Zajaczek's forces merged with those of Kosciuszko. He commanded the forces in the inconclusive battle of Gokow on 910 July, and soon after he was one of the Polish commanders of the defense of Warsaw that lasted from mid July until early September. In the following few weeks Zajaczek became one of the members of the Supreme National Council, and a president of its Criminal Court. He was a commander of the defense of Warsaw during the disastrous battle of Praga of 4 November. During the battle Zajaczek was wounded and retreated from the battle even before the conflict was over. He has been criticised for his insufficient preparation for the defense of Warsaw against Russian invasion, and for poor leadership during the battle. Zajaczek escaped to Polish Galicia where he was interned by Austrians. He was released one year later, moving to Paris. In Paris, Zajaczek quickly became involved with the active emigre groups there. Hoping to sway revolutionary France into supporting the Polish cause, many Poles, including him, volunteered to join the French Revolutionary Army, eventually leading to the creation of the Polish Legions in Italy led by Jan Henryk Dabrowski, which became a part of Napoleon's army. On 8 March 1797 Napoleon ordered that Zajaczek should be recognized as an active brigade general of the French army. That year he published a brochure on his experiences of the 1794 war, Histoire de la revolution de Pologne en 1794, in which he tried to justify his actions. Zajaczek was, however, still unpopular among the Polish troops, many of whom blamed him for the fall of Praga due to frequent personal conflicts, Zajaczek chose to remain with the French army, rather than joining the Legions themselves. Over the coming years, he took part in the French Revolutionary Wars. He took part in the 1798 Egyptian Expedition. There he also served as a governor of several provinces, first, from July that year, of the Monufia Governorate, later, from January 1799, simultaneously of the Faiyum Governorate and Beni Suef Governorate. On 25 January 1800 he defeated Murad Bey at the Battle of Sediman. In 1801 he was promoted to division general, and later took part in the failed defense of Alexandria. In 1802 Zajaczek became the commander of the French 2nd Division. In 1803 he received the Knight's Cross of the Legion of Honour a year later, the Commander's Cross. In 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition he was assigned to the French Army of the Rhine, where he worked at army's High Command. Next year in September, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, he was assigned to command of the foreign mostly Polish North Legion in the following month he organized another similar unit, the Kalisz Legion. In 1808 those units were reorganized into parts of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw, in which Zajaczek became a general. During that time, dissatisfied with his transfer from the French army, and being made subject to Prince Jozef Poniatowski whom he disliked, he refused to wear a Polish uniform and swear an oath to the Duchy, and was forced to do so only on direct orders of French marshal Louis Nicolas Davout. In 1809 he commanded several formations in the PolishAustrian War, where he failed to distinguish himself, instead suffering the only significant defeat in this campaign at the battle of Jedlinsk on 11 June. He remained in the Army after the war, commanding the 2nd Division, and organizing the troops for the expected conflict with Russia. During Napoleon's Invasion of Russia in 1812, Zajaczek commanded the 16th Infantry Division of the V Corps in la Grande Armee. His division performed well at the battle of Smolensk in August where he was wounded, recuperating till October. He rejoined his unit in the time to take part in the battle of Tarutino. After Prince Poniatowski, commander of the V Corps, was wounded, from 1 November Zajaczek took charge of that formation. He led it at the battle of Vyazma and battle of Krasnoi until a wound at Berezina claimed his leg, which was amputated by doctor Dominique Jean Larrey. While recuperating from the wound he was taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army in Wilno Vilnius . Zajaczek's name is found on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Zajaczek was imprisoned in Poltava fortress until January 1814, first to Biaystok, then in July he was returned to Warsaw. There he was assigned to the post of a deputy president of a Military Commission, reorganizing the former Napoleonic Army of the Duchy of Warsaw into a new, Russian controlled Army of the Congress Poland. Russian tsar Alexander I, also newly crowned King of Poland, gave Zajaczek on 3 December 1815 the position of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland tsar's deputized ruler of the territory, a position similar to that of a viceroy . This nomination surprised many, including Zajaczek himself, who is said to have at first refused this position, but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order. Zajaczek's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews, both among his contemporaries, as well as among later historians. He was actively interested in economic development of Polish lands, and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom's lands he was also one of the founders of the University of Warsaw. He has been criticized, however, for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position, too servile to the wishes of his patron, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland, which contributed to a slow but steady erosion of the country's freedoms and autonomy. Deferential towards the Russian authorities, he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander's commissar, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution, become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom. In recognition of Zajaczek's services, Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of 'Prince of Poland' on 27 April 1818. In the spring of 1826 Zajaczek fell ill, steadily becoming weaker. On 25 July that year he lost consciousness, and died in the morning of 28 July. He died in Warsaw's palace called Paac Namiestnikowski Regent's Palace , nowadays a seat of the President of Poland. His funeral lasted from 2 to 5 August. He was buried at the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus in Opatowek, where he had a manor on the lands received from Napoleon. His heart was placed in the Bernardine Church in Warsaw, and his insides were buried at the Powazki Cemetery, also in Warsaw. Zajaczek and his wife had no children Aleksandra outlived her husband by nineteen years.

He started 24 of 30 regular season games in 2009 and played in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup final, when the Sounders became the second MLS team to win the tournament in their inaugural season. Zakuani provided a much needed attacking presence from the wing he was the third best scorer with four goals throughout the regular season. The press considered him a candidate for Rookie of the Year because he had the highest number of goals and assists of all new players. The award eventually went to Omar Gonzalez. A local reporter praised him for improving his assistance to the defence and making better offensive runs as the season progressed. Although Zakuani was already known as a top young player, coach Sigi Schmid wanted him to improve his on field decision making and increase his fitness before the next year. In 2009, a shoulder injury that had limited Zakuani's ability to play the full 90 minutes per game forced him to undergo surgery during the off season. In his second professional year, Zakuani scored ten goals, equalling the score of striker Fredy Montero for the team lead. He also made six assists. Zakuani was named MLS Player of the Week twice the first was after recording both goals in a 21 win over Colorado, and the second was awarded for both a goal and an assist in a 21 victory over Chivas USA. Fans around the league voted the strike against Chivas as the Goal of the Week. Zakuani also won the award for his perfectly timed break past the defensive back line for a one on one situation with the goalkeeper while scoring a goal against Toronto FC. He also recorded the fastest scored goal in club history with a fourth minute tally against Columbus Crew, beating the previous record he had set the season before. Zakuani was again in the starting line up for the 2010 U.S. Open Cup final, which Seattle won to become the first team since 1983 to repeat as Open Cup champions. On 7 November 2010, he scored the Sounders' first ever playoff goal in a 21 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy. He received his green card after the season this helped the team because MLS limits the number of international players available to each team and receiving permanent resident status exempted him from the cap. Zakuani scored two goals and had two assists in his first six appearances of the 2011 season. On 22 April 2011, a harsh challenge by Brian Mullan led to Zakuani fracturing his tibia and fibula three minutes into a game against the Colorado Rapids. He was airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery the same day. During recovery, doctors feared that his leg would require amputation because of compartment syndrome. The concern was caused by a lack of blood flow that hurt the nerves connecting the area to his foot. Mullan initially defended the tackle, saying he would make the challenge again. He later apologized in the face of increasing scrutiny and received a 10 game suspension matching the longest ban in MLS history to date and a 5,000 fine. Nelson Rodriguez, an executive vice president of MLS, said in a statement that the disciplinary committee felt the egregious nature of Mullans foul justified the punishment. 'Mullans tackle is the type of play we need to eliminate from our game, and the level of discipline is consistent with our efforts to do so.' Zakuani missed the remainder of the season, and this injury marked the beginning of the end of his career as a starter in pro soccer. Zakuani's injury was one of several to key players throughout the league that year, leading to criticism that MLS play was aggressive to the point of thuggery . On 7 July 2012, after 15 months away, Zakuani returned in a match against Mullan and the Rapids. His return as a substitute with five minutes left in the game met provoked emotional cheers from the fans. Having already publicly forgiven Mullan, the two hugged and exchanged shirts after the whistle. Within two months, he appeared to further his recovery with an assist against FC Dallas and then scored a goal against San Jose Earthquakes. He finished the 2012 season with one goal in 320 minutes over eight matches and went on to play in three playoff games before the team was eliminated. During the 2013 season, Zakuani made only nine appearances across all competitions before being sidelined with a sports hernia. In that time, he recorded one assist in league play, and assisting in the game winning goal against Mexico's Tigres UANL in the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals. He was later placed on injured reserve and twice underwent surgery on each side of his groin. Zakuani's contract was allowed to expire, effectively ending his five year career with the Sounders, during which he started in 67 of 78 appearances in league play. At the time, he was the clubs third leading scorer with 17 goals. In January 2017, The Seattle Times reported that Zakuani had been training with the team for some time, with coach Brian Schmetzer describing his situation as somewhere between a 'trial' and just pure training . A month later, he announced that he would not return to professional soccer and instead continue his broadcasting duties with the Sounders. On 12 December 2013, Zakuani was selected by Portland Timbers as the number two pick in the MLS Re Entry Draft a yearly draft that allows teams to select players who are out of contract or have had their options declined by their current teams. The Timbers traded up for the opportunity. Zakuani was reunited with Caleb Porter, his former Akron coach, who had become the Portland manager. His pay was cut by 60,000 to 120,000 a year. Zakuani was expected to receive additional minutes immediately because first choice winger Rodney Wallace was recovering from injury. Zakuani appeared in the Timbers' opening match of 2014 against Philadelphia Union as a substitute in the 85th minute. The Sounders and Timbers are fierce rivals when the teams met in the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Zakuani assisted former college team mate Darlington Nagbe in the Timbers' only goal during the 31 loss to his previous club. Zakuani scored his first goal for Timbers on 19 August 2014, scoring the opening goal in a 41 win over Alpha United in the 201415 CONCACAF Champions League. After the match, Porter spoke to the media about the need to bench Zakuani because of his persistent muscle strains. Zakuani announcing his retirement. 2014 was disappointing for Zakuani he scored no goals and only three assists. On 29 October 2014, Zakuani announced his retirement in a blog post. Having scored only one goal and five assists in the previous three seasons, he cited his difficulty recovering from numerous injuries. He had lost much of his precision, pace, and confidence since being hurt. He retired at the relatively early age of 26 his retirement after his initial promise led Sports Illustrated to describe his career as a roller coaster . Zakuani was eligible to play for both Congo and England. He considers London his hometown but still sees himself as Congolese. Of his five siblings, as of April 2015 , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town and is a member of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England a long shot . Later in his career, he expressed interest in playing for the United States, saying, of the three, I prefer the States as this is where I made my name as a player . In 2010, Zakuani accepted a call up from Congo for a friendly match against Mali. In a press release, Zakuani called it the highest honor of his young career. It was a challenging decision for him but the wait to become eligible to play for the United States was too long. The game was played in Dieppe, France, in November 2010. Zakuani started the match and came off at half time with Congo in the lead. Mali rallied in the second half, beating Congo in a 31 loss. Description of Zakuani's play in Sports Illustrated. Zakuani was a right footed player who preferred being on the left of the field. He played on the left wing in a 442 formation with Arsenal later he was a forward in college before converting to a winger professionally. Zakuani said he played with a style he learned at Arsenal's youth academy and that he tried to emulate the style of former winger Robert Pires. Zakuani often sought advice from former Arsenal star Freddie Ljungberg when they played together in Seattle. Zakuani was a quick, agile player who liked to take defenders one on one. While coaching him at Akron, Porter said many of Zakuani's goals came after long runs that beat multiple players. Since retiring in 2014, Zakuani has been a part of the Sounders broadcast team as an analyst and later color commentator. He published a memoir, 500 Days , in 2015 and a documentary in 2018 that chronicled his recovery from the 2011 injury. Zakuani served as an assistant coach for the Tacoma Stars, an indoor team in the Major Arena Soccer League, from 2015 to 2016. He became the head coach at Bellevue High School in 2019, taking the team to a league championship. As a teenager in London, Zakuani began mixing with the wrong crowd . He was distracted from soccer by girls and parties. He said in an interview, A lot of the people I grew up with ended up in prison, taking drugs, and never made it to university . He has strong feelings about the increase of knife crime in London since one of his friends was killed. In 2010, he founded the non profit organization Kingdom Hope to run youth soccer camps in the greater Seattle area. He remembers being focused on soccer instead of education in Europe the organization is focused on providing collegiate scholarships to young athletes.

"Codex Zacynthius designated by siglum or 040 in the Gregory Aland numbering A1 in von Soden is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. First thought to have been written in the 8th century, it is a palimpsestthe original lower text was washed off its vellum pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century. The upper text of the palimpsest contains weekday Gospel lessons the lower text contains portions of the Gospel of Luke, deciphered by biblical scholar and palaeographer Tregelles in 1861. The lower text is of most interest to scholars. The manuscript came from Zakynthos, a Greek island, and has survived in a fragmentary condition. It was brought to England in 1821 and transferred to Cambridge University in 1985. It is often cited in critical editions of the Greek New Testament. The lower text of the manuscript contains fragments of the chapters 1 1 11 33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves it measures 36 x 29 cm. The text was written in a single column with well formed uncial script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes. Abbreviations are rarely used in the codex. The handwriting is very close to that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts e.g. , , , which are not used in later medieval manuscripts. The codex uses a peculiar system of chapter divisions, which it shares with Codex Vaticanus and Minuscule 579. A more common system divides chapters according to their titles. The capital letters at the beginnings of sections stand out in the margin as in the Codices Alexandrinus and Ephraemi. The text is surrounded by a marginal commentary it is the only codex that has both text and commentary in uncial script. The commentary is a catena of quotations of nine church fathers Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small uncial letters. Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria 93 scholia next comes Titus of Bostra 45 scholia . The commentary was written in a different kind of uncial script than the biblical text. The book contains the following chapters and verses of the Gospel of Luke 1 1 9,19 23,27 28,30 32,36 60,77 2 19,21 22,33 3 3 5 8,11 20 4 1 2,6 20,32 43 5 17 36 6 21 7 6,11 37,39 47 8 4 21,25 35,43 50 9 1 28,32 33,35 9 41 10 18,21 40 11 1 4,24 33. The textual character of the codex is representative of the late Alexandrian text type, and is similar to the Codex Regius. Kurt and Barbara Aland gave the following textual profile of it 21, 82, 21 2, 3s. This means the text of the codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 2 times, it agrees 8 times with the original text against the Byzantine and it agrees both with the Byzantine and original text 2 times. There are 3 independent or distinctive readings. On the basis of this profile the Alands considered the quality of the text to suit his Category III. According to the Claremont Profile Method, it represents the Alexandrian text in Luke 10 and mixed Byzantine text type in Luke 1, which probably indicates sporadic Byzantine corrections. The codex is a palimpsest, meaning that the original text was scraped off and overwritten and the parchment leaves folded in half. The upper text was written by a minuscule hand and contains lectionary 299 l 299 from the 12th or 13th century, though the lectionary text is not complete it is written on 176 leaves 28.7 cm by 18.2 cm , in one column per page, 33 36 lines per page. Three folios are only the lower halves of leaves, one folio was supplied with paper folio LXVIII . The manuscript contains weekday Gospel lessons Evangelistarium , but is lacunose. Tregelles did not collate its text because of its secondary value. Scrivener designated it by siglum 200, Gregory by 299. Lectionary 299 in Mark 6 33 has textual reading along with Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, 0187 omit , 892, l 49, l 69, l 70, l 303, l 333, l 1579, l 950 , itaur, vg, copsa, bo . The text of the lectionary is cited in some critical editions of the Greek New Testament UBS3 in the following places Matthew 10 4 11 17 12 47 13 13 14 22 18 10 22 30 26 27 28 9 Mark 1 27 2 10.26 4 16.20 6 2.2.3.33. It is not cited in UBS4. Tregelles dated the manuscript to the 8th century. Tregelles was aware that the handwriting is typical for the 6th century, but the handwriting of the commentary is much older. The letters are round, high, and narrow, and could not have been written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, the manuscript could not have been written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century. William Hatch in 1937, on the basis of palaeographical data, suggested that the codex should be dated to the 6th century. It does not use breathings and accents and the text of the commentary is written in uncial script. Aland supported Hatch's point of view. This date is accepted by the majority of scholars. David C. Parker in 2004 argued that manuscript was written later than the 6th century, because it has a small number of square letters, and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed , , , the bar over the letter is short and the letter is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 6th century. The early history of the manuscript is unknown. In 1821 it was brought by general Colin Macaulay to England from the Greek island Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. The manuscript was placed in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society Mss 24 in London. Scholz saw the manuscript in 1845, and Paul de Lagarde in 1853, but they did not decipher it. The lower text of the codex was deciphered, transcribed, and edited by Tregelles in 1861. Tregelles used types originally cast for printing the Codex Alexandrinus, which only approximately represented the shape of the letters of the codex. The hand written letters are smaller than the type. Tregelles included one page of typographical facsimile in this edition. He did not decipher the small Patristic writing and doubted that it could be read without chemical restoration. Nicholas Pocock found errors in Tregelles' edition, but William Hatch thought it satisfactory. J. Harold Greenlee corrected Tregelles' errors and edited the list of corrections in 1957, which was examined by William Hatch. In 1959 Greenlee published a commentary. The codex probably needs another examination with modern technology. Tischendorf cited the codex in his Editio Octava Critica Maior in 564 places. It is often cited in the critical editions of the Greek New Testament UBS3, UBS4, NA26, NA27 . In 1985 it was moved to the Cambridge University Library BFBS Ms 213 . In December 2013, the Bible Society announced plans to sell some manuscripts, among them the Codex Zacynthius, to raise funds for a Visitors Centre in Wales. The University was given right of first refusal and has until February 2014 to raise the money to acquire the codex.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex%20Zacynthius

"Zambia competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's participation at London marked its twelfth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The delegation consisted of seven competitors three track and field athletes Gerald Phiri, Prince Mumba and Chauzje Choosha, one each in Boxing and Judo Gilbert Choombe and Boas Munyonga and two swimmers, Zane Jordan and Jade Ashleigh Howard. Phiri, Mumba, Choombe and Munyonga had qualified by meeting the standards in their respective sports, and Choosha, Jordan and Howard qualified by wildcard places. Mumba was the national flag bearer at the opening and closing ceremonies. Phiri received a bye in the men's 100 metres and was eliminated at the first round stage and recorded his best time of the 2012 athletic season. Mumba and Choosha were both eliminated from the competition in the parliamentary heats, and Choombe was defeated by Australian Jeff Horn in Boxing's round of 32. Munyonga was disqualified in his round of 32 match against Takahiro Nakai by holding his opponent's leg, a move he later regretted. Jordan failed to advance beyond the heats of the men's 100 metre backstroke despite recording a new personal best, while his female counterpart Howard was also eliminated in the same stage in the women's 100 metre freestyle. Zambia has participated at twelve Olympiads from its debut at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan as Northern Rhodesia and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, with the exception of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa. The highest number of athletes sent by Zambia to a summer Games is 37 to the Soviet 1980 Summer Olympics. Two Zambian athletes Keith Mwila and Samuel Matete have won medals at the Olympic Games. Zambia participated in the Summer Olympics from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The Zambia National Olympic Committee NOC selected three track and field athletes via qualification standards. An NOC would be able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the A standard, or one athlete per event if they met the B standard. The seven athletes that were selected to compete in the London Games were Gerald Phiri in the men's 100 metres, Prince Mumba in the men's 800 metres and Chauzje Choosha in the women's 100 metres. Choosha qualified via a wildcard and replaced long distance runner Tonny Wamulwa, who withdrew before the opening of the Games because of injuries sustained in a road traffic accident on 9 July.

Boxer Gilbert Choombe qualified for the men's light welterweight following the conclusion of the AIBA African Olympic Qualifying Event. Zambia's sports minister Chishimba Kambwili stated that the country's national government did not expect their athletes to win any medals at the London Games but would help build a team for future games and expose them to international media. The country's NOC secretary general Hazel Kennedy said it was comforting that the team sent athletes who had qualified on merit rather than a majority on wildcards. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mumba and Phiri were Zambia's best chances of achieving success. The team elected to train at the Palace of Art Centre for Sport Excellence and Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow for two weeks. Mumba was the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.

Overall he finished 15th out of 75th athletes overall and was unable to progress further because his time was 0.09 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round. After the event Phiri said he placed a large amount of pressure onto himself but was not good enough in the event. Nevertheless, he thanked the people who supported him. Prince Mumba was the oldest man to compete in the athletics for Zambia at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Mumba qualified for the London Games, as his personal best time of one minute and 46.14 seconds met the B standard for his event, the 800 metres.

He made his Olympian debut, the youngest male athlete on the Zambia Olympic delegation, at age 20. Choombe trained in Cardiff where it was affected by rain and cold weather and later adapted to hot weather conditions in London. He stated that his objective was to claim the gold medal and make Zambia proud. Choombe began the contest in the round of 32 against Australia's Jeff Horn at ExCeL London on 31 July. Horn began strongly by performing quick shots at Choombe who attempted to react by throwing back some punches but missed most of them. Horn clinched the first round 61, and took the second round by 42 when Choombe made his guard vulnerable to attack. Horn attacked consistently and by selecting his angles, he defeated Choombe 195. After the fight Choombe described it as tough and that he had a feeling of securing the victory but knew his opponment was stronger. Boas Munyonga represented Zambia in men's judo. He qualified by being awarded an additional place in the additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga made his Olympian debut as Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Games, at age 31. He said that he would do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signaled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he regretted the move and that he had forgotten about the rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor. Zane Jordan was the only member of the Zambia team to be a two time Olympian, having competed at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. He qualified after receiving a universality place from FINA as his best time of 59.33 seconds was not within the A and B standard entry times. Jordan was drawn in first heat of the men's 100 metre backstroke which was held on 29 July, finishing third and last with a time of 58.47 seconds.

He finished 43rd and last of all swimmers who competed, and did not advance to the later stages of the 100 metres backstroke. Jordan's performance was praised by his coach Gajan Sothylingam who described it as extremely good and he felt that it showed that the swimmer was improving on his performance. Jade Ashleigh Howard had the distinction of making her Olympian debut as the youngest member of the athletes at the age of 17. Like Jordan, Howard qualified after receiving a universality place from FINA, her personal best time of one minute and 1.24 seconds was outside the A and B qualification standard. She stated that her objective to record a new personal best time and that she was not inimitated. Howard took part in heat four of the women's 100 metre freestyle, which was held on 1 August, finishing first out of seven swimmers, with a time of 59.35 seconds. She ranked ahead of Bayan Jumah of Syria 59.78 seconds and Paraguay's Karen Riveros Schulz 59.86 seconds . Despite her victory, she finished 39th out of 48 swimmers who competed, and did not advance to the later stages of the women's 100 metre freestyle. Nevertheless, she achieved her objective of setting a new personal best time, and became the first Zambian swimmer to set a fastest time under one minute.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics
"Jan Sariusz Zamoyski Latin Ioannes Zamoyski de Zamoscie 19 March 1542 3 June 1605 was a Polish nobleman, magnate, and the 1st ordynat of Zamosc. He served as the Royal Secretary from 1565, Deputy Chancellor from 1576, Grand Chancellor of the Crown from 1578, and Great Hetman of the Crown from 1581. Zamoyski was the General Starost of the city of Krakow from 1580 to 1585, Starost of Bez, Miedzyrzecz, Krzeszow, Knyszyn and Tartu. An important advisor to Kings Sigismund II Augustus and Stephen Bathory, he was one of the major opponents of Bathory's successor, Sigismund III Vasa, and one of the most skilled diplomats, politicians and statesmen of his time, standing as a major figure in the politics of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth throughout his life. Jan Zamoyski was born on 19 March 1542 to Stanisaw Zamoyski and Anna Herburt in Skokowka. He started his education in a school in Krasnystaw but when he was thirteen years old he was sent to study abroad from 1555 to 1559 he was a page at the royal court in Paris. Already at this young age he attended lectures at the Sorbonne University and College de France. In 1559 he briefly visited Poland, then attended the University of Strasbourg after a few months there he moved to University of Padua, where from 1561 he studied law and received a doctorate in 1564. During his years abroad he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism. During his education, he became active in university politics, and in 1563 he was elected the rector of the law department. Around that time he also wrote De senatu Romano, a brochure about Ancient Rome government. He returned to the Commonwealth in 1565, and was the first person to receive a commendation letter from the senate of the Republic of Venice. After returning to Poland, he was appointed to the Royal Chancellery, and soon became a favorite secretary to King Sigismund II. In 1567 he commanded a royal task force, sent to remove the noble family of Starzechowscy from the royal lands they were decreed to hold illegally. Another major task he completed at that time was the reorganization of the Chancellery archive. In 1571 he married Anna Ossolinska his wife and their young son died shortly afterwards, in 1572. After the extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty in 1572 during the election sejm special session of the Commonwealth parliament he used his influence to enforce the viritim election meaning all nobles had the right to vote for the new king during the upcoming 1573 PolishLithuanian royal election . However, his proposal for majority voting did not pass, which opened the process for abuses of liberum veto in the future. He was a colleague of Mikoaj Sienicki and Hieronim Ossolinski, and with them he was one of the leaders of a faction of the lesser and middle nobility szlachta in the Commonwealth, whose goal was the reform the country the execution movement preserving the unique constitutional and parliamentary government of the Commonwealth with the dominant role of poorer nobility Golden Freedom . He was so influential and popular among the lesser nobility that he was known as the first tribune of nobility or Polish Gracchus. In that first election he was in favour of Henry de Valois later, Henry III of France . Subsequently, he was part of the diplomatic mission that traveled to France to finish formalities with the newly elected king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henryk secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which ended up in the marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania. Bathory thanked Zamoyski by granting him the office of Deputy Chancellor on 16 May 1576. He participated on Batory's side in the quelling of the Danzig rebellion in 15761577, sponsoring a choragiew of pancerni cavalry unit and participating in close combat on several occasions. In 1577 he married again, this time marrying Krystyna Radziwi, daughter of magnate Mikoaj Radziwi Czarny this made him a close ally of the Radziwi family, the most powerful family in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1578 he received the post of the Grand Crown Chancellor. That year poet Jan Kochanowski dedicated his Odprawa Posow Greckich, the first Polish tragedy, to him. He took part in the preparation for a war against Muscovy in 15791581, where he contributed a group of 400 or 600 mercenaries. Through he had little prior military background nor experience, he was interested in mastering the military art, and proved to be an adept learner. With Batory's support, he began filling in for some of the roles of Grand Crown Hetman Mikoaj Mielecki, particularly when Mielecki was not present. While not campaigning, he was also instrumental in ensuring that the ongoing political support for the war. In 1580 he was hit by another personal tragedy, as his wife died in labor, together with their child entering a short period of depression. Later that year, in August, he captured Velizh in September he participated in the siege of Velikiye Luki, and then took Zavoloc. On 11 August 1581 he received the nomination for the post of Grand Crown Hetman this nomination, although uncontroversial at that time, was technically illegal. Following that he participated in the long and inconclusive Siege of Pskov, which ended with the Peace of Yam Zapolsky in 1582. Though Zamoyski failed to capture Pskov, he drained the Russian resources, and the ongoing siege was a major reason for the final treaty, which was highly favorable to Poland. In June 1583 Zamoyski took his third wife, Gryzelda Bathory, a relative of king Bathory himself. In May 1584 Zamoyski's men captured Samuel Zborowski, a noble whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade shortly afterwards with Bathory's consent Zborowski was executed. This political conflict between Bathory, Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility, would be a major recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years, beginning with a major dispute at the Sejm of 1585. After the death of Batory in 1586, Zamoyski helped Sigismund III Vasa gain the Polish throne, fighting in the brief civil war against the forces supporting Habsburg archduke Maximilian III of Austria. The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian was supported by the Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Krakow and defeated Maximilian's forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which Sawomir Lesniewski describes as one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski's military career , Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and Bedzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown. Later that year Zamoyski proposed a reform of the royal elections, which failed to pass the Sejm. Zamoyski presented to this Sejm a project that in case the present King should die without issue none but a candidate of some Slav stock should henceforth be eligible to th Polish throne. This was a project which could even imagine the possibility of some kind of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy and semi Protestant Bohemia. In fact, it was a circuitous and clumsy counter proposal against pro Habsburg policy. From 1589 Zamoyski, in his role as the hetman, tried to prevent the intensifying Tatar incursions along the Commonwealth south eastern border, but with little success. In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a buffer zone between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire this would lead to a lengthy campaign. Meanwhile, in internal Commonwealth politics, early on in Sigismund III's reign, Zamoyski, who was once a staunch supporter of the Commonwealth kings, begun to distance himself from the King. Sigismund had quickly allied himself with the Habsburgs, much to chancellors dissatisfaction. Zamoyski was dissatisfied with Sigismund's early plans to use Poland as a stepping stone to gaining the Swedish crown, as Sigismund was plotting to cede the Polish crown to the Habsburgs in exchange for their support of his right to the Swedish throne. The new King feared the chancellor's power, but due to Commonwealth laws he was unable to dismiss him from his posts. He offered him a prestigious voivode of Krakow office, but Zamoyski declined, as if he was to accept, the law would require him to resign from his slightly less prestigious but more influential chancellorship. By 15901591 Zamoyski was seen as one of the king's staunchest opponents. Open quarrel between king and chancellor broke out during the Sejm of 1591, culminating in a heated exchange of words and the king storming out of the chamber. Despite their tensed relations, neither the king nor the chancellor wanted a civil war soon after their quarrel Zamoyski would issue a public apology to the king and their uneasy relationship would continue until Zamoyski's death. In 1594 Zamoyski once again failed to stop a Tatar incursion in the southern borders. The next year was much more successful, as in Moldavia in 1595 he was victorious in the Battle of Cecora, and helped hospodar Ieremia Movila Jeremi Mohya gain the throne. In 1600 he fought against Michael the Brave Micha Waleczny, Mihai Viteazul , hospodar of Wallachia and the new Prince of Transylvania, who had conquered Moldavia a few months earlier. He defeated him on the Bukova Bucovu and restored Ieremia to the throne. He also helped his brother, Simion Movila to become brief ruler of Wallachia, thus spreading the influence of the Commonwealth to the Central Danube. In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski took part in the war against Sweden commanding the Commonwealth forces in Livonia Inflanty . At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command. At the Sejm of 1603 Zamoyski led opposition to the governance reforms proposed by Sigismund seeing in them intentions of transforming the Commonwealth into an absolute monarchy. Later, he also opposed Sigismund's plans to intervene in the civil war plaguing Muscovy the Time of Troubles and the Dymitriads . He clashed with Sigismund for the final time during the Sejm of January 1605. Zamoyski died suddenly on 3 June 1605, due to a stroke. His fortune was inherited by his single son, Tomasz Zamoyski. The fame of Zamoyski, significance in life, endured after his death. He was praised by artists such as Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanisaw Staszic, Stanisaw Tarnowski and Artur Sliwinski. There were also those critical of him Hugo Koataj, Jozef Szujski, Micha Bobrzynski. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski's posthumous career was even more magnificent than his real one. Lesniewski, ending his recent biography of Zamoyski, concludes that he is a significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance. Zamoyski was the subject of several paintings and drawings. Most notably, he is one of the characters in two large paintings by Jan Matejko, featured on the Skarga's Sermon and Batory at Pskov. Having control of both the Chancellorship and the Grand Hetman office, Zamoyski was one of the most powerful people in the country, having obtained both the power of Grand Hetman commander in chief of the armed forces and that of chancellor, combined for the first time in the hands of one person. He was responsible for much of the Polish internal and foreign policies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history. Even though his military career begun almost as an afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered as one of the most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field. Zamoyski gathered a significant fortune his estates generated a revenue of over 200,000 zloties in the early 17th century. His personal lands covered 6,445 square kilometres 2,488 sq mi , and included eleven towns and over 200 villages. He was a royal caretaker of another dozen or so cities and over 600 villages. Totaled, his personal and leased lands covered over 17,000 square kilometres 6,600 sq mi , with 23 towns and cities and 816 villages. In 1589 he succeeded in establishing the Zamoyski Family Fee Tail ordynacja zamojska , a de facto duchy. Zamoyski supported economical development of his lands, investing in colonization of frontiers, and the development of industry, both small sawmills, breweries, mills and such and large his lands had four iron mills and four glass factories . His most prized creation was the capital of his Fee Tail, the city of Zamosc, founded in 1580, built and designed as a Renaissance citta ideale or ideal city by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando. In the city, in 1595 he founded the Akademia Zamojska, the third university in the history of education in Poland. In addition to Zamosc, he also funded four other towns Szarogrod, Skinderpol, Busza and Jasnogrod. Zamoyski collected a significant library, and was a patron of numerous artists in his Fee Tail. Artists under his patronage included the poets Jan Kochanowski and Szymon Szymonowic, and the writer and historian Joachim Bielski. Zamoyski was not a deeply religious person, and his conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism was primarily pragmatic. Lesniewski notes that Zamoyski was often motivated by greed, for example during the Danzig Rebellion, when he supported lenient treatment of the rebels, and during the 15771578 negotiations with, when he favored the solution of George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg Ansbach in both cases his decision was likely influenced by bribes or favors. In another example, Lesniewski describes how Zamoyski openly demanded rewards following his victory at Byczyna, and tried to include an article favoring him in the Bytom and Bedzin treaty. He further notes, critically, that with raising power and political success Zamoyski begun displaying negative qualities, such as egoism and arrogance. Zamoyski was ruthless to those weaker than him. At the same time, he was respected by his opponents, widely recognized as highly intelligent, a cunning strategist and tactician in matters political and military, and a popular political leader. He valued the good of the country at least as high as his own, and although he could have become the king after a victorious civil war against Sigismund, he preferred to act within the limits of law instead, avoiding a war that could devastate the country, and thus curbing his own ambitions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan%20Zamoyski
"The Zanzibar women's national football team, nicknamed the Zanzibar Queens , is the women's representative team from Zanzibar, a semi autonomous part of Tanzania. Founded in 1988, the team has limited recognition as the regional governing body, the Zanzibar Football Association, is a full member of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations CECAFA and Confederation of African Football CAF , but Zanzibar Football Association is not recognised by Federation Internationale de Football Association FIFA as an independent national association. The national team was supposed to have its first international matches in the CECAFA Women's Challenge Cup in October 2007, but the event was cancelled. The team plays domestically against men's sides in Zanzibar. The development of women's football in Zanzibar faces several challenges specific to Africa and their own islands, including efforts to politicize the game. Zanzibar is a territory consisting of two main islands, Unguja Zanzibar and Pemba, and is a semi autonomous part of Tanzania with its own government. As of the 2002 census, it had a total population of 984,625. Women's football in Africa has not developed compared to elsewhere because of a variety of factors, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. Another problem with the development of the game throughout the continent is that higher ability players leave to play in Europe or the United States. According to Kuhn, funding for the game on a regional level is problematic as national associations do not fund the women's game adequately. Zanzibar has unique problems relating to the development of the women's game including pressures for female players to wear the hijab while playing and pressure from male family members not to participate as their involvement may bring shame to the family. There is minimal support for the game at schools, with the national federation not responding to requests from the national team coach to work harder to get girls to play the sport in school. A national women's league was created in 2004 after a 26 year effort. Five teams competed in the inaugural season Women Fighters, Nyuki FC, Koani Sisters, Bungi Sisters and Policewomen FC. Women Fighters won the first two editions of the league, however, the league has since collapsed. Founded in 1988 by Nassra Juma Mohammed of Tanzania, the Women Fighters was Zanzibar's first women's football club, upon which the national team was built, and the team was created at a time when there were very few women's national teams in existence. Prior to 1988, women had played informally or on men's only teams several of these players, as well as those from other sports, including badminton, made up the inaugural team. The team soon played a game against the touring Swedish women's club side, Tyreso FF in Zanzibar's largest football stadium, losing the game 015 at Amaan Stadium. At the time the team was created, there were few opportunities for it to compete against other women's teams in Zanzibar, but they have played and sometimes beaten men's teams in Zanzibar while receiving support from the Zanzibar Football Association and Zanzibar's Ministry of Sport. The players do not wear a hijab or cover up as part of their kit, which has led to criticism from religious leaders for playing in public while wearing shorts and jersey tops, instead of covering their bodies according to Muslim custom. The team trains in Stone Town at the Mao Tse Tung Stadium. Player recruitment and retention has been a problem because some members of the national team have been prohibited from playing by their husbands or family members. Male relatives of the Fighters team have beaten players because they disgrace them . National team players are eligible to play for Tanzania in all competitions. Aziza Mwadini and Sabai Yusuf are two Zanzibar based players who have participated in a Tanzanian national team training camp. As of 2011 , Mohammed remained the team's head coach. The national association, founded in 1926, is recognised by the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations CECAFA , but not by Federation Internationale de Football Association FIFA despite repeated attempts for such recognition. However, it became a member of CAF in 2017, after previously being an associate member, and plans to re apply for FIFA membership, which it last did unsuccessfully in 2005. Zanzibar were meant to play in the inaugural CECAFA Women's Challenge Cup in October 2007, but the tournament was ultimately cancelled because of an inability to attain funding from CECAFA to cover costs connected to the competition. The competition was to have been jointly funded by CAF and CECAFA. The CECAFA secretary, Nicholas Musonye said of the event, CAF wants to develop women football in this region in recognition of the milestones CECAFA has achieved over the years. CAF appreciates what CECAFA has done despite the hardships the association has gone through, from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations. Member states in the CECAFA region have not taken women's football seriously. CAF now wants to sponsor a long term campaign to attract women from this region into the game. CECAFA, after many false starts, eventually staged the first ever CECAFA Women's Championship in 2016 in Uganda, and Zanzibar were one of seven participating teams. They lost all 3 group games, scoring just 1 goal and conceding 30. In 2007, a movie was made about the team called Zanzibar Soccer Queens. The film was featured at the BFI London Film Festival in 2007.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team
"Zaolzie listen is the Polish name for an area now in the Czech Republic which was disputed between interwar Poland and Czechoslovakia. The name means lands beyond the Olza River it is also called Slask zaolzianski, meaning trans Olza Silesia . Equivalent terms in other languages include Zaolsi Zaolzi in Czech and Olsa Gebiet in German. The Zaolzie region was created in 1920, when Cieszyn Silesia was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland. Zaolzie forms the eastern part of the Czech portion of Cieszyn Silesia. The division did not satisfy any side, and persisting conflict over the region led to its annexation by Poland in October 1938, following the Munich Agreement. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the area became a part of Nazi Germany until 1945. After the war, the 1920 borders were restored. Historically, the largest specified ethnic group inhabiting this area were Poles. Under Austrian rule, Cieszyn Silesia was initially divided into three Bielitz, Friedek and Teschen , and later into four districts plus Freistadt . One of them, Frydek, had a mostly Czech population, the other three were mostly inhabited by Poles. During the 19th century the number of ethnic Germans grew. After declining at the end of the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 the Czech population grew significantly mainly as a result of immigration and the assimilation of locals and Poles became a minority, which they are to this day. Another significant ethnic group were the Jews, but almost the entire Jewish population was murdered during World War II by the Germans. In addition to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group living in the area, the Slazakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian national identity. This group enjoyed popular support throughout the whole of Cieszyn Silesia although its strongest supporters were among the Protestants in eastern part of the Cieszyn Silesia now part of Poland and not in Zaolzie itself. The term Zaolzie meaning the trans Olza , i.e. lands beyond the Olza is used predominantly in Poland and also commonly by the Polish minority living in the territory. In Czech it is mainly referred to as Ceske Tesinsko Ceskotesinsko land around Cesky Tesin , or as Tesinsko or Tesinske Slezsko meaning Cieszyn Silesia . The Czech equivalent of Zaolzie Zaolsi or Zaolzi is rarely used. The term of Zaolzie is also used by some foreign scholars, e.g. American ethnolinguist Kevin Hannan. The term Zaolzie denotes the territory of the former districts of Cesky Tesin and Frystat, in which the Polish population formed a majority according to the 1910 Austrian census. It makes up the eastern part of the Czech portion of Cieszyn Silesia. However, Polish historian Jozef Szymeczek notes that the term is often mistakenly used for the whole Czech part of Cieszyn Silesia. Since the 1960 reform of administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia, Zaolzie has consisted of Karvina District and the eastern part of Frydek Mistek District. After the Migration Period the area was settled by West Slavs, which were later organized into the Golensizi tribe. The tribe had a large and important gord situated in contemporary Chotebuz. In the 880s or the early 890s the gord was raided and burned, most probably by an army of Svatopluk I of Moravia, and afterwards the area could have been subjugated by Great Moravia, which is however questioned by historians like Zdenek Klanica, Idzi Panic, Stanisaw Szczur. After the fall of Great Moravia in 907 the area could have been under the influence of Bohemian rulers. In the late 10th century Poland, ruled by Bolesaw I Chrobry, began to contend for the region, which was crossed by important international routes. From 950 to 1060 it was under the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia, and from 1060 it was part of Poland. The written history explicitly about the region begins on 23 April 1155 when Cieszyn Tesin was first mentioned in a written document, a letter from Pope Adrian IV issued for Walter, Bishop of Wrocaw, where it was listed amongst other centres of castellanies. The castellany was then a part of Duchy of Silesia. In 1172 it became a part of Duchy of Raciborz, and from 1202 of Duchy of Opole and Raciborz. In the first half of the 13th century the Moravian settlement organised by Arnold von Huckeswagen from Stary Jicin castle and later accelerated by Bruno von Schauenburg, Bishop of Olomouc, began to press close to Silesian settlements. This prompted signing of a special treaty between Duke Wadysaw of Opole and King Ottokar II of Bohemia on December 1261 which regulated a local border between their states along the Ostravice River. In order to strengthen the border Wadysaw of Opole decided to found Orlova monastery in 1268. In the continued process of feudal fragmentation of Poland the Castellany of Cieszyn was eventually transformed in 1290 into the Duchy of Cieszyn, which in 1327 became an autonomic fiefdom of the Bohemian crown. Upon the death of Elizabeth Lucretia, its last ruler from the Polish Piast dynasty in 1653, it passed directly to the Czech kings from the Habsburg dynasty. When most of Silesia was conquered by Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1742, the Cieszyn region was part of the small southern portion that was retained by the Habsburg monarchy Austrian Silesia . Up to the mid 19th century members of the local Slav population did not identify themselves as members of larger ethnolinguistic entities. In Cieszyn Silesia as in all West Slavic borderlands various territorial identities pre dated ethnic and national identity. Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread slowly in Silesia. From 1848 to the end of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co operated, united against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria Hungary. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions arose as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the most important factor was material well being they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava west of the ethnic border , as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava about 8 of the population have Polish surnames. The Czech population living mainly in the northern part of the area Bohumin, Orlova, etc. declined numerically at the end of the 19th century, assimilating with the prevalent Polish population. This process shifted with the industrial boom in the area. Cieszyn Silesia was claimed by both Poland and Czechoslovakia the Polish Rada Narodowa Ksiestwa Cieszynskiego made its claim in its declaration Ludu slaski of 30 October 1918, and the Czech Zemsky narodni vybor pro Slezsko did so in its declaration of 1 November 1918. On 31 October 1918, at the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria Hungary, the majority of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities supported by armed forces. The interim agreement of 2 November 1918 reflected the inability of the two national councils to come to final delimitation. On 5 November 1918, the area was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia by an interim agreement of two local self government councils Czech Zemsky narodni vybor pro Slezsko and Polish Rada Narodowa Ksiestwa Cieszynskiego . Before that, the majority of the area was taken over by Polish local authorities. In 1919 both councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw. The former was not satisfied with this compromise and on 23 January 1919 invaded the area while Poland was engaged in its war against the West Ukrainian National Republic. The reason for the Czech invasion in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm parliament of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were to be held in the whole of Cieszyn Silesia. The Czechs claimed that the polls must not be held in the disputed area as the delimitation was only interim and no sovereign rule should be executed there by any party. When the Czech demand was rejected by the Poles, the Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force. Czech units were held up near Skoczow and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed the area partly on historic and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. The area was important for the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed the area the Kosice Bohumin Railway, which was one of only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time . The area is also very rich in black coal. Many important coal mines, facilities and metallurgy factories are located there. The Polish side based its claim to the area on ethnic criteria a majority 69.2 of the area's population was Polish according to the last 1910 Austrian census. In this very tense atmosphere it was decided that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation declared a state of emergency in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1 of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9 of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as Zaolzie the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory. The most vocal support for union with Poland had come from within the territory awarded to Czechoslovakia, while some of the strongest opponents of Polish rule came from the territory awarded to Poland. Historian Richard M. Watt writes, On 5 November 1918, the Poles and the Czechs in the region disarmed the Austrian garrison ... The Poles took over the areas that appeared to be theirs, just as the Czechs had assumed administration of theirs. Nobody objected to this friendly arrangement ... Then came second thoughts in Prague. It was observed that under the agreement of 5 November, the Poles controlled about a third of the duchy's coal mines. The Czechs realized that they had given away rather a lot ... It was recognized that any takeover in Teschen would have to be accomplished in a manner acceptable by the victorious Allies ... , so the Czechs cooked up a tale that the Teschen area was becoming Bolshevik ... The Czechs put together a substantial body of infantry about 15,000 men and on 23 January 1919, they invaded the Polish held areas. To confuse the Poles, the Czechs recruited some Allied officers of Czech background and put these men in their respective wartime uniforms at the head of the invasion forces. After a little skirmishing, the tiny Polish defense force was nearly driven out. In 1919, the matter went to consideration in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful in order to influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get most of the people and the strategic rail line. Watt writes Czech envoy Edvard Benes proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Benes was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Benes knew what he was doing. A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's. Watt argues that Benes strategically waited for Poland's moment of weakness, and moved in during the Polish Soviet War crisis in July 1920. As Watt writes, Over the dinner table, Benes convinced the British and French that the plebiscite should not be held and that the Allies should simply impose their own decision in the Teschen matter. More than that, Benes persuaded the French and the British to draw a frontier line that gave Czechoslovakia most of the territory of Teschen, the vital railroad and all the important coal fields. With this frontier, 139,000 Poles were to be left in Czech territory, whereas only 2,000 Czechs were left on the Polish side . The next morning Benes visited the Polish delegation at Spa. By giving the impression that the Czechs would accept a settlement favorable to the Poles without a plebiscite, Benes got the Poles to sign an agreement that Poland would abide by any Allied decision regarding Teschen. The Poles, of course, had no way of knowing that Benes had already persuaded the Allies to make a decision on Teschen. After a brief interval, to make it appear that due deliberation had taken place, the Allied Council of Ambassadors in Paris imposed its 'decision'. Only then did it dawn on the Poles that at Spa they had signed a blank check. To them, Benes' stunning triumph was not diplomacy, it was a swindle ... As Polish Prime Minister Wincenty Witos warned 'The Polish nation has received a blow which will play an important role in our relations with the Czechoslovak Republic. The decision of the Council of Ambassadors has given the Czechs a piece of Polish land containing a population which is mostly Polish.... The decision has caused a rift between these two nations which are ordinarily politically and economically united' .... The affair soured the Prague Warsaw relationship. Another account of the situation in 19181919 is given by historian Victor S. Mamatey. He notes that when the French government recognised Czechoslovakia's right to the boundaries of Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia in its note to Austria of 19 December, the Czechoslovak government acted under the impression it had French support for its claim to Cieszyn Silesia as part of Austrian Silesia. However, Paris believed it gave that assurance only against German Austrian claims, not Polish ones. Paris, however, viewed both Czechoslovakia and Poland as potential allies against Germany and did not want to cool relations with either. Mamatey writes that the Poles brought the matter before the peace conference that had opened in Paris on 18 January. On 29 January, the Council of Ten summoned Benes and the Polish delegate Roman Dmowski to explain the dispute, and on 1 February obliged them to sign an agreement redividing the area pending its final disposition by the peace conference. Czechoslovakia thus failed to gain her objective in Teschen. With respect to the arbitration decision itself, Mamatey writes that On 25 March, to expedite the work of the peace conference, the Council of Ten was divided into the Council of Four The Big Four and the Council of Five the foreign ministers . Early in April the two councils considered and approved the recommendations of the Czechoslovak commission without a change with the exception of Teschen, which they referred to Poland and Czechoslovakia to settle in bilateral negotiations. When the Polish Czechoslovak negotiations failed, the Allied powers proposed plebiscites in the Cieszyn Silesia and also in the border districts of Orava and Spis now in Slovakia to which the Poles had raised claims. In the end, however, no plebiscites were held due to the rising mutual hostilities of Czechs and Poles in Cieszyn Silesia. Instead, on 28 July 1920 the Spa Conference also known as the Conference of Ambassadors divided each of the three disputed areas between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division of Cieszyn Silesia. About 12,000 to 14,000 Poles were forced to leave to Poland. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates depending mainly whether the Silesians are included as Poles or not range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self declaration and many Poles filled in Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities but reality in Zaolzie was quite different. Local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. Czechs schools were built in ethnically almost entirely Polish municipalities. This and other factors contributed to the cultural assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After few years, the heightened nationalism typical for the years around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co operated with Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not follow certain laws related to language, legislative and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put those issues on agenda. One way or the other, more and more local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population. Within the region originally demanded from Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1938 was the important railway junction city of Bohumin Polish Bogumin . The Poles regarded the city as of crucial importance to the area and to Polish interests. On 28 September, Edvard Benes composed a note to the Polish administration offering to reopen the debate surrounding the territorial demarcation in Tesinsko in the interest of mutual relations, but he delayed in sending it in hopes of good news from London and Paris, which came only in a limited form. Benes then turned to the Soviet leadership in Moscow, which had begun a partial mobilisation in eastern Belarus and the Ukrainian SSR on 22 September and threatened Poland with the dissolution of the Soviet Polish non aggression pact. The Czech government was offered 700 fighter planes if room for them could be found on the Czech airfields. On 28 September, all the military districts west of the Urals were ordered to stop releasing men for leave. On 29 September, 330,000 reservists were up throughout the western USSR. Nevertheless, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Jozef Beck, believed that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German occupation of the city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague time until noon the following day. At 11 45 a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Wadysaw Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5 km2 with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390 km2 with 854,277 inhabitants. The Germans were delighted with this outcome, and were happy to give up the sacrifice of a small provincial rail centre to Poland in exchange for the ensuing propaganda benefits. It spread the blame of the partition of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, made Poland a participant in the process and confused political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany a charge that Warsaw was hard put to deny. The Polish side argued that Poles in Zaolzie deserved the same ethnic rights and freedom as the Sudeten Germans under the Munich Agreement. The vast majority of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice, but they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various key positions from which locals were fired. The Polish language became the sole official language. Using Czech or German by Czechs or Germans in public was prohibited and Czechs and Germans were being forced to leave the annexed area or become subject to Polonization. Rapid Polonization policies then followed in all parts of public and private life. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. The Roman Catholic parishes in the area belonged either to the Archdiocese of Breslau Archbishop Bertram or to the Archdiocese of Olomouc Archbishop Leopold Precan , respectively, both traditionally comprising cross border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakia and Germany. When the Polish government demanded after its takeover that the parishes there be disentangled from these two archdioceses, the Holy See complied. Pope Pius XI, former nuncio to Poland, subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie to an apostolic administration under Stanisaw Adamski, Bishop of Katowice. Czechoslovak education in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared socialists the opposition and rightists loyal to the new Polish national authorities . Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued to feel like second class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939. When Poland entered the Western camp in April 1939, General Gamelin reminded General Kasprzycki of the Polish role in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. According to historian Paul N. Hehn, Polands annexation of Teschen may have contributed to the British and French reluctance to attack the Germans with greater forces in September 1939. Richard M. Watt describes the Polish capture of Teschen in these words Amid the general euphoria in Poland the acquisition of Teschen was a very popular development no one paid attention to the bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles. He predicted that it would not be long before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans. Watt also writes that the Polish 1938 ultimatum to Czechoslovakia and its acquisition of Teschen were gross tactical errors. Whatever justice there might have been to the Polish claim upon Teschen, its seizure in 1938 was an enormous mistake in terms of the damage done to Poland's reputation among the democratic powers of the world. Daladier, the French Prime Minister, told the US ambassador to France that he hoped to live long enough to pay Poland for her cormorant attitude in the present crisis by proposing a new partition. The Soviet Union was so hostile to Poland over Munich that there was a real prospect that war between the two states might break out quite separate from the wider conflict over Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Prime Minister, Molotov, denounced the Poles as Hitler's jackals . In his postwar memoirs, Winston Churchill compared Germany and Poland to vultures landing on the dying carcass of Czechoslovakia and lamented that over a question so minor as Teschen, they sundered themselves from all those friends in France, Britain and the United States who had lifted them once again to a national, coherent life, and whom they were soon to need so sorely. ... It is a mystery and tragedy of European history that a people capable of every heroic virtue ... as individuals, should repeatedly show such inveterate faults in almost every aspect of their governmental life. On 1 September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe, and subsequently made Zaolzie part of the Military district of Upper Silesia. On 26 October 1939 Nazi Germany unilaterally annexed Zaolzie as part of Landkreis Teschen. During the war, strong Germanization was introduced by the authorities. The Jews were in the worst position, followed by the Poles. Poles received lower food rations, they were supposed to pay extra taxes, they were not allowed to enter theatres, cinemas, etc. Polish and Czech education ceased to exist, Polish organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Katowice's Bishop Adamski was deposed as apostolic administrator for the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie and on 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, nuncio to Germany, returned them to their original archdioceses of Breslau or Olomouc, respectively, with effect of 1 January 1940. The German authorities introduced terror into Zaolzie. The Nazis especially targeted the Polish intelligentsia, many of whom died during the war. Mass killings, executions, arrests, taking locals to forced labour and deportations to concentration camps all happened on a daily basis. The most notorious war crime was a murder of 36 villagers in and around Zywocice on 6 August 1944. This massacre is known as the Zywocice tragedy Polish Tragedia Zywocicka . The resistance movement, mostly composed of Poles, was fairly strong in Zaolzie. So called Volksliste a document in which a non German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp were introduced. Local people who took them were later on enrolled in the Wehrmacht. Many local people with no German ancestry were also forced to take them. The World War II death toll in Zaolzie is estimated at about 6,000 people about 2,500 Jews, 2,000 other citizens 80 of them being Poles and more than 1,000 locals who died in the Wehrmacht those who took the Volksliste . Also a few hundred Poles from Zaolzie were murdered by Soviets in the Katyn massacre. Percentage wise, Zaolzie suffered the worst human loss from the whole of Czechoslovakia about 2.6 of the total population. Immediately after World War II, Zaolzie was returned to Czechoslovakia within its 1920 borders, although local Poles hoped it would again be given to Poland. While most Czechoslovaks of German ethnicity were expelled, the local Polish population again suffered discrimination, as many Czechs blamed them for the discrimination by the Polish authorities in 19381939. Polish organizations were banned, and the Czechoslovak authorities carried out many arrests and dismissed many Poles from work. The situation had somewhat improved when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power in February 1948. Polish property deprived by the German occupants during the war was never returned. As to the Catholic parishes in Zaolzie pertaining to the Archdiocese of Breslau Archbishop Bertram, then residing in the episcopal Jansky vrch castle in Czechoslovak Javornik Jauernig , appointed Frantisek Onderek 18881962 as vicar general for the Czechoslovak portion of the Archdiocese of Breslau on 21 June 1945. In July 1946 Pope Pius XII elevated Onderek to Apostolic Administrator for the Czechoslovak portion of the Archdiocese of Breslau colloquially Apostolic Administration of Cesky Tesin Czech Apostolska administratura ceskotesinska , seated in Cesky Tesin, thus disentangling the parishes from Breslau's jurisdiction. On 31 May 1978 Pope Paul VI merged the apostolic administration into the Archdiocese of Olomouc through his Apostolic constitution Olomoucensis et aliarum. Poland signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia in Warsaw on 13 June 1958 confirming the border as it existed on 1 January 1938. After the Communist takeover of power, the industrial boom continued and many immigrants arrived in the area mostly from other parts of Czechoslovakia, mainly from Slovakia . The arrival of Slovaks significantly changed the ethnic structure of the area, as almost all the Slovak immigrants assimilated into the Czech majority in the course of time. The number of self declared Slovaks is rapidly declining. The last Slovak elementary school was closed in Karvina several years ago. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Zaolzie has been part of the independent Czech Republic. However a significant Polish minority still remains there. The entry of both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and especially the entry of the countries to the EU's passport free Schengen zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls on the border between the countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed to cross the border freely at any point of their choosing. The area now belongs mostly to the Cieszyn Silesia Euroregion with a few municipalities in the Euroregion Beskydy. Ethnic structure of Zaolzie based on census results Sources Zahradnik 1992, 178179.

"Stylianos Zaoutzes Greek , but in Skylitzes was a high Byzantine official of Armenian origin. Rising to high rank under Byzantine emperor Basil I reigned 867886 , he then rose further to prominence under Basil's successor Emperor Leo VI the Wise r. 886912 , who had a close friendship and possibly an affair with Stylianos's daughter Zoe Zaoutzaina. Stylianos Zaoutzes was Leo's leading minister during the first half of his reign, and was awarded the unique title of basileopator. His standing and influence declined after 895, but in 898, he became Leo's father in law when the Byzantine emperor married Zoe. He died in 899, in the same year as Zoe. Following an attempted coup by his relatives, the Zaoutzes clan was deprived of the considerable power it had amassed under Stylianos's tutelage. Zaoutzes was of Armenian descent, and was born in the thema of Macedonia. It has been theorized by the historian Nicholas Adontz that Zaoutzes might be the son of a contemporary strategos of Macedonia named Tzantzes, the name also of Zaoutzes's son, but the connection is ultimately impossible to prove. According to Steven Runciman, the surname Zaoutzes derives from the Armenian word Zaoutch, negro , reflecting Zaoutzes's particularly dark complexion. In the same vein, Zaoutzes was known among Byzantines as the Ethiopian . Whatever his exact ancestry, he shared ethnic and geographical origin with the Emperor Basil I the Macedonian, a factor that probably played an important role in his ascent to high office during the latter's reign. In late 882, the young Leo, Basil's second son and heir after the death of his elder brother Constantine in 879, was wedded to Theophano, a member of the Martinakes family. The bride was the choice of empress Eudokia Ingerina, and did not please Leo, who instead preferred the company of Zoe Zaoutzaina, the beautiful daughter of Stylianos Zaoutzes. Whether Zoe was actually his mistress is uncertain Leo himself strenuously denied this in later accounts. At that point, Zaoutzes held the post of mikros hetaireiarches, i.e. commander of the junior regiment of the Byzantine emperor's mercenary bodyguard, the hetaireia. Leo's relations with his father Basil were always strained, and when Theophano informed him of this affair, Basil reportedly became enraged, beat Leo until he bled, and married Zoe off to one Theodore Gouzouniates. Furthermore, in 883, Leo was denounced as plotting against Basil and was imprisoned it was only through the intervention of patriarch Photios and Stylianos Zaoutzes that he was not also blinded. This affair does not seem to have hurt Zaoutzes's own standing with Basil or his career, for by the end of Basil's reign he was protospatharios and megas hetaireiarches senior commander of the hetaireia . Leo spent three years in prison, until released and restored to his rank in late July 886. Here too Zaoutzes played a major role, as he personally pleaded with the Byzantine emperor to secure Leo's release. By that time, Basil was ailing, and on August 12, 886, he was gravely wounded during a hunt. Zaoutzes's participation in the hunt raised suspicions of a conspiracy, but his complicity is generally rejected, as Basil survived for nine days, during which he did not punish Zaoutzes. Upon Basil's death, Leo was crowned emperor, but Zaoutzes, who was awarded the titles of patrikios and magistros and the office of logothetes tou dromou, effectively assumed control of the government, directing state policy. One tradition, based on the Vita Euthymii the hagiography of Patriarch Euthymios I , holds that Basil himself appointed Zaoutzes as regent epitropos , but other sources indicate that his ascent to power was more gradual. It is indicative of his authority that most of Leo's ordinances novels are directed to him in person, and in 893, he succeeded in getting his protege, Antony Kauleas, elected as Patriarch of Constantinople. In the same period between 886 and 893 , Emperor Leo VI himself delivered a homily on a church built on Zaoutzes's orders in Constantinople. Zaoutzes's rise to prominence was consolidated in 891893, when he was given the newly created title of basileopator father of the emperor . His promotion to this new and enigmatic title has been a subject of controversy, as neither the reasons for the creation of the title nor its exact functions are known. The early date of his elevation precludes a relation to the eventual rise of his daughter Zoe to the imperial throne as Leo's empress. Gratitude for Zaoutzes's support against Basil may have played a role, and a common theory is that the office implied some form of tutorship over the emperor. The office certainly confirmed Zaoutzes as the senior secular official of the Byzantine Empire. However, although Zaoutzes has traditionally been regarded as an all powerful regent over a weak emperor, in no small part due to the account provided in the Vita Euthymii, the actual relationship between the two may have been quite different. A more careful evaluation of the source material has led modern scholarship to conclude that Leo was actively involved in government, and that Zaoutzes as chief minister was loyal and obsequious to his master. An assessment of his record as the Byzantine Empire's first minister is difficult. Of the few available sources on his career, the Vita Euthymii, compiled years after Zaoutzes's death, is extremely hostile, seeking to pin the responsibility for several of the reign's failures or unpopular decisions on him, and thus preserve Leo from blame. The account of the Vita is further colored by the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and Euthymios, then a synkellos and Leo's spiritual father, over influence on the Byzantine emperor. Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army, as well as for the outbreak of hostilities with Bulgaria in 893 allegedly, two of his proteges moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants. When Leo, at the behest of Zaoutzes, rejected the merchants' protests, the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I found a pretext to attack Byzantium. It has, however, been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo's initiative, aiming to enrich Thessalonica, whose patron saint, Saint Demetrius, he showed special favor to. Nevertheless, all this has led to the enduring image of an ineffectual leadership in foreign and military affairs under Zaoutzes. This may explain why, despite the resumption of Leo's affair with Zoe, the relationship between Zaoutzes and the emperor became strained tales of an alleged plot by Zaoutzes's son to murder Leo in 894 895 indicate a rift between the two, and although Zaoutzes himself was not involved, a major quarrel between them ensued shortly after. Although they were reconciled, Zaoutzes's standing seems to have declined further thereafter, as two of his proteges, found guilty of accepting bribes, were punished by Leo. Nevertheless, in late summer 898, following the death of Theophano in December 865 or 866 and of Zoe's first husband Gouzouniates in early 898, Leo at last married Zoe, raising her to Augusta. In the next year, however, both Zoe and Stylianos died. Following their deaths, Leo proposed to marry yet again, choosing Eudokia Baiana as his wife. Zaoutzes's numerous relatives, who had benefited from his patronage, were fearful of losing their positions to the new Empress's relations, and conspired to overthrow Leo. Chief among them was Basil, Zoe's nephew. The plot, however, was betrayed by the eunuch servant Samonas, and the conspiracy suppressed. The Zaoutzes relatives were exiled or confined to monasteries, and the clan's power broken. Samonas himself was richly rewarded he was taken into the imperial service and rapidly promoted, becoming parakoimomenos by 908, before he too fell from favor.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylianos%20Zaoutzes
"John Sigismund Zapolya or Szapolyai Hungarian Szapolyai Janos Zsigmond 7 July 1540 14 March 1571 was King of Hungary as John II from 1540 to 1551 and from 1556 to 1570, and the first Prince of Transylvania, from 1570 to his death. He was the only son of John I, King of Hungary, and Isabella of Poland. John I ruled parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, with the support of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the remaining areas were ruled by Ferdinand I, who also claimed Hungary. The two kings concluded a peace treaty in 1538 acknowledging Ferdinand's right to reunite Hungary after John I's death, but shortly after John Sigismund's birth, and on his deathbed, John I bequeathed his realm to his son. The late king's staunchest supporters elected the infant John Sigismund king, but he was not crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary. Suleiman invaded Hungary under the pretext of protecting John Sigismund against Ferdinand. The capital of Hungary, Buda, fell to the Ottomans without opposition in 1541, but Suleiman allowed the dowager queen, Isabella, to retain the territory east of the river Tisza on John Sigismund's behalf. Isabella and John Sigismund moved to Lippa now Lipova in Romania . Before long, they took up residence in Gyulafehervar in Transylvania now Alba Iulia in Romania . John Sigismund's realm was administered by his father's treasurer, George Martinuzzi, who wanted to reunite Hungary under the rule of Ferdinand. Martinuzzi forced Isabella to renounce her son's realm in exchange for two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins in 1551. John Sigismund and his mother settled in Poland, but she continued to negotiate for John Sigismund's restoration with Ferdinand's enemies. Ferdinand could not protect eastern Hungary against the Ottomans. Urged by Suleiman, the Transylvanian Diet in 1556 persuaded John Sigismund and his mother to return to Transylvania. She ruled her son's realm until her death in 1559. A wealthy lord, Melchior Balassa, rebelled against John Sigismund in late 1561, which contributed to the loss to Ferdinand of most counties outside Transylvania. The Szekely people, whose liberties had been restricted in the 1550s, also rose up against John Sigismund, but he crushed the rebellion. During the ensuing war against the Habsburgs, the Ottomans supported John Sigismund, and he paid homage to Suleiman in Zemun in 1566. The 1568 Treaty of Adrianople concluded the war, confirming John Sigismund in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary Transylvania and Partium . John Sigismund initiated a series of theological debates among the representatives of the concurring theological schools of the Reformation in the 1560s. He converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism in 1562 and from Lutheranism to Calvinism in 1564. Around five years later, accepting the Anti Trinitarian views of his physician, Giorgio Biandrata and court preacher Ferenc David, he became the only Unitarian monarch in history. In 1568, the Diet passed the Edict of Torda now Turda in Romania , which emphasized that faith is a gift of God and prohibited the persecution of people for religious reasons. The edict expanded the limits of freedom of religion beyond the standards of late 16th century Europe. John Sigismund abandoned the title elected king of Hungary in the Treaty of Speyer in 1570. Thereafter, he styled himself Prince of Transylvania and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary . He died childless. The Catholic Stephen Bathory succeeded him. John Sigismund's father, John Zapolya, was the wealthiest Hungarian lord in the early 16th century. After the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Hungarian army in the Battle of Mohacs, the majority of the noblemen elected John Zapolya king in 1526. However, a group of influential lords proclaimed Ferdinand of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, king in the same year. Hungary fell into a civil war that lasted for decades. John paid homage to Suleiman at Mohacs in 1529 to secure Ottoman support against Ferdinand. However, neither John nor Ferdinand could win control of the whole country during the next years. To conclude the civil war, the two kings' envoys signed the Treaty of Varad on 24 February 1538, which confirmed both kings' right to retain the lands that they held. John, who was childless, also acknowledged Ferdinand's right to take control of his realm the central and eastern part of the Kingdom of Hungary after his death. John also stipulated, if he fathered a son, his son would inherit his ancestral domains. Ferdinand, however, proved unable to protect John's realm against an Ottoman invasion. At age 52 John married Isabella Jagiellon, the 22 year old daughter of Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, on 2 March 1539. The humanist scholars Paolo Giovio and Antun Vrancic emphasized that Isabella was one of the most educated women of their age. John Sigismund was born in Buda on 7 July 1540. On learning of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers' camp to inform them of the good news. The following day John fell ill, and he died on 21 or 22 July. Before his death he persuaded those present at his death bed to take an oath that they would prevent the transfer of his realm to Ferdinand. Soon after John Zapolya died, his treasurer, George Martinuzzi, hurried to Buda to secure John Sigismund's inheritance. On Martinuzzi's proposal, the Diet of Hungary elected John Sigismund king on 13 September 1540, but he was not crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary. The Diet proclaimed Queen Isabella and George Martinuzzi, along with two powerful lords, Peter Petrovics and Balint Torok, the guardians of the infant monarch. In August, Ferdinand's envoys had demanded the transfer of the late John Zapolya's realm to Ferdinand in accordance with the Treaty of Varad. Peter Perenyi, who had been the commander of Zapolya's troops in Upper Hungary, and Franjo Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, soon deserted to Ferdinand. The wealthy Stephen Majlath expelled most of John Sigismund's supporters from Transylvania in an attempt to seize the province for himself. Ferdinand's envoy, Hieronymus aski, informed Suleiman of the Treaty of Varad, asking the sultan to consent to the unification of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. Instead, the sultan stated that he supported John Sigismund and had aski arrested. Ferdinand's army seized Visegrad, Vac, Pest, Tata and Szekesfehervar in October, but could not capture Buda. His military commander, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, again laid siege to Buda on 4 May 1541. Suleiman left Istanbul at the head of a large army in June to take advantage of the new civil war in Hungary. On his command, Petru Rares, Prince of Moldavia, captured Stephen Majlath and forced the Transylvanian Diet to swear fealty to John Sigismund in late July. Roggendorf lifted the siege of Buda before Suleiman reached the town on 26 August. Suleiman said that he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also announced that he wanted to see the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords including George Martinuzzi and Balint Torok accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29 August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This turned out to be a trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Balint Torok was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins. Isabella and Martinuzzi left Buda on 5 September 1541, taking John Sigismund and the Holy Crown with them. She and her son settled in Lippa, which was the center of an old domain of the Zapolya family. The delegates of the counties of John Sigismund's realm met in Debrecen on 18 October. They swore fealty to him and acknowledged the sultan's suzerainty. Martinuzzi signed a treaty with Ferdinand I's representative, Caspar Seredy, in Gyalu now Gilau in Romania on 29 December. According to the Treaty of Gyalu, Hungary was to be reunited under the rule of Ferdinand, but John Sigismund's right to the Zapolyas' domains in Upper Hungary was confirmed. On 29 March 1542, the Three Nations of Transylvania urged Isabella to move from Lippa which was located near the Ottoman Empire to Transylvania. After John Statileo, Bishop of Transylvania, died in April, the Diet granted the domains of the bishopric to the royal family. Isabella and John Sigismund moved to Gyulafehervar in June, taking up residence in the bishops' castle. The Transylvanian Diet confirmed the Treaty of Gyalu in August. The representatives of the noblemen of the Partium the counties between the Tisza and Transylvania also consented to a war against the Ottoman Empire in November. However, the Habsburgs' army was unable to recapture Pest or defeat the Ottomans. Caspar Seredy came to Gyalu to take possession of John Sigismund's realm on Ferdinand's behalf, but Isabella refused him on 17 December. Three days later, the Diet declared the Treaty of Gyalu null and void, over the objections of the delegates of the Transylvanian Saxons. The relationship between Isabella and Martinuzzi was tense. Martinuzzi continued to control state administration and finance even after the Diet confirmed Isabella's superior position in February 1543. The first tribute from John Sigismund's realm was sent to the Ottoman Sultan in June. In the same month, Saxon clergymen from Kronstadt now Brasov in Romania , who had adopted Lutheranism, participated in a debate with Catholic priests in the presence of the queen and Martinuzzi in Gyulafehervar. The Saxons were allowed to leave, although Martinuzzi, who was bishop of Varad, wanted to bring them before court on charges of heresy. In April 1544, the Diet of Torda prescribed that travellers should respect the religious customs of the settlements they visited, showing that the ideas of the Reformation had spread to the whole province. The first Transylvanian Diet at which delegates from the Partium were present met in August 1544. At the Diet, Martinuzzi was made chief justice. Five counties that had previously accepted Ferdinand's rule Bereg, Szabolcs, Szatmar, Ung and Zemplen swore allegiance to John Sigismund before the end of 1555. The Ottomans laid claim to two fortresses, Becse and Becskerek now Novi Becej and Zrenjanin in Serbia , in early 1546. The sultan refused to include John Sigismund's realm in the peace treaty that he concluded with Ferdinand's brother, Emperor Charles V, in 1547. Both actions suggested that Suleiman intended to seize part of John Sigismund's kingdom, prompting Isabella and Martinuzzi to reopen negotiations with Ferdinand on the reunification of Hungary in 1548. Martinuzzi and Ferdinand's envoy, Nicolaus of Salm, signed a treaty in Nyirbator on 8 September 1549. According to their agreement, Isabella and John Sigismund were to abdicate in exchange for the Silesian duchies of Opole and Raciborz and 100,000 florins in compensation. Isabella refused to execute the treaty and remained in Gyulafehervar. Martinuzzi laid siege to the town, forcing her to give up resistance in October 1550. Isabella and her supporters Peter Petrovics and Ferenc Patocsy made a new attempt to prevent the execution of the Treaty of Nyirbator in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them. Under duress, Isabella abdicated in favor of Ferdinand on John Sigismund's behalf, in return for the two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins on 19 July. Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26 July. Isabella and John Sigismund left Transylvania on 6 August 1551, accompanied by Peter Petrovics. They settled in Kassa now Kosice in Slovakia , and moved to Opole in March 1552. Realizing that the Silesian duchies were poor, they left for Poland before the end of April. During the following years they lived in Krakow, Warsaw, Sanok, and other Polish towns. John Sigismund often went hunting for bison and regularly visited his uncle, Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland. However, his health was delicate because he suffered from epilepsy and chronic intestinal disorders. The contemporaneous historian Ferenc Forgach, who was Isabella's implacable enemy, accused her of bringing her son up shamefully , allowing him to keep bad company and drink. John Sigismund's tutors were actually humanist scholars the Hungarian Mihaly Csaky and the Polish Wojciech Nowoposki. Nowoposki aroused John Sigismund's interest in theological debates. Ferdinand's rule remained fragile in the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary because he did not send enough mercenaries to defend them. Suspecting that Martinuzzi was conspiring with the Ottomans, Castaldo had Martinuzzi murdered in late 1551. The Ottomans occupied the lowlands of Banat in the summer of 1552. In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella to return to Hungary. Peter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an assembly of the Szekely people declared their loyalty to John Sigismund. However, both uprisings were crushed before the end of September. Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should be restored to John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Peter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella to return to Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund. Suleiman sent messages to the Transylvanian lords in 1555, demanding they obey John Sigismund without resistance. Before the end of the year, the representatives of the Three Nations petitioned Ferdinand either to send reinforcements or to absolve them from their oath of fealty. Petrovics stormed into Transylvania in early 1556. The Diet swore an oath of fealty to John Sigismund on 12 March 1556, referring to him as the son of King John . The envoys of the Diet departed for Poland on 1 June to persuade Isabella and her son to return. Two weeks later, Ferdinand informed Suleiman that he was ready to withdraw his troops from John Sigismund's former realm. The representatives of the Three Nations received Isabella and John Sigismund with much pomp and ceremony in Kolozsvar now Cluj Napoca in Romania on 22 October 1556. The Diet confirmed her right to administer state affairs in the name of her son, who was still a minor. In the following months several counties outside Transylvania including Abauj, Bihar, and Gomor also acknowledged John Sigismund's rule. Isabella adopted a tolerant religious policy, enabling the spread of Calvinism, especially in Partium and Kolozsvar. In 1559 she started new negotiations with Ferdinand, proposing to renounce her son's title of king if Ferdinand would agree to marry one of his daughters to John Sigismund and to confirm John Sigismund's rule in the lands to the east of the Tisza. However, the dowager queen died at the age of 40 on 18 September 1559. John Sigismund's rule began with his mother's death. Rather than adopting a new title, he continued to style himself rex electus king elect . Mihaly Csaky, Christopher and Stephen Bathory, and his mother's other advisors continued to participate in state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand's daughters, but also to announce his claim to the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. His demands were rejected, but peace was preserved. John Sigismund showed a particular interest in religious matters and initiated several debates among the representatives of diverse theological schools. The first debate was held between Lutheran and Calvinist priests in Medgyes now Medias in Romania in January 1560. A year and a half later, John Sigismund sent letters to the University of Wittenberg and other theological centers in Germany to seek advice on the main points of the two Protestant schools of thought. Melchior Balassa, one of the wealthiest lords in John Sigismund's realm, deserted to Ferdinand in December 1561. John Sigismund moved to seize Balassa's domains, but his army was routed at Hadad now Hodod in Romania on 4 March 1562. Stirred up by Balassa, the Szekely commoners rose to restore their ancient liberties including exemption from taxes , which had been restricted in the 1550s. John Sigismund's army routed them in May, and their leaders were impaled or mutilated. The Diet adopted new laws to restrict the privileges of the Szekelys, including a ban on the employment of commoners as jurors. Two new royal castles named Szekelytamad Szekely assault and Szekelybanja Szekely regret were erected in the Szekely Land. After Balassa's revolt, most counties outside Transylvania changed allegiance from John Sigismund to Ferdinand. To persuade Ferdinand to renounce the counties, John Sigismund even offered not to style himself king, but this was rejected in July 1562. John Sigismund, originally Roman Catholic, converted to Lutheranism before the end of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata who as an Anti Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view to head a synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc David his court preacher. Ferdinand died on 25 July 1564, and his son Maximilian succeeded him. The Transylvanian Diet declared war to reoccupy the counties that had been lost to the Habsburgs in 1562. John Sigismund's army seized Szatmar now Satu Mare in Romania , Hadad and Nagybanya now Baia Mare in Romania before the end of 1562, but a counter invasion by Lazarus von Schwendi reached the river Szamos in March 1565. The envoys of John Sigismund and Maximilian concluded a treaty in Szatmar on 13 March 1565 in which John Sigismund renounced his title of king in return for the recognition of his hereditary rule in Transylvania John Sigismund was also to marry Maximilian's sister, Joanna. However, the Ottomans forced John Sigismund to declare the treaty null and void on 21 April. John Sigismund and Hasan, Pasha of Temesvar, joined forces and recaptured Erdod now Ardud in Romania , Nagybanya and Szatmar. He intended to see the sultan in Istanbul to give an explanation for the Treaty of Szatmar, but Suleiman informed him that he would personally come to Hungary. Ferenc David began to include Anti Trinitarian ideas in his sermons, which infuriated the Calvinist bishop of Debrecen, Peter Melius Juhasz. John Sigismund organized an open debate about the doctrine of Trinity, which was held in Gyulafehervar in April 1566. After the debate John Sigismund granted funds to the Calvinist publishing house in Debrecen. He also sponsored the establishment of Protestant colleges in Kolozsvar, Marosvasarhely present day Targu Mures in Romania and Nagyvarad. His letters to Petrus Ramus and other leading scholars of the Reformation show that he wanted to develop the royal college in Gyulafehervar into an academy. An anthology of Italian poems, published in Venice in the 1560s, hailed John Sigismund as patron of the Renaissance . Sultan Suleiman came to Zemun on the Danube in preparation for his campaign against Habsburg territories in the summer of 1566. John Sigismund hurried to the sultan's camp, accompanied by 400 Transylvanian lords. After John Sigismund and his principal advisors prostrated themselves before the sultan in his tent, Suleiman confirmed John Sigismund's position as hereditary ruler. According to the eyewitness Mustafa Selaniki, the sultan addressed John Sigismund as his beloved son . John Sigismund invaded Upper Hungary on the sultan's order on 28 July. However, when Suleiman died during the Siege of Szigetvar on 6 September, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ordered John Sigismund to return to Transylvania. In a letter written about this time to Cosimo I, Duke of Florence, the mercenary Giovanandrea Gromo described John Sigismund as extremely benevolent, gracious, subtle in thought, wise, level headed, industrious brave . Gromo mentioned that John Sigismund spoke Latin, Italian, German, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian well, and could also speak Greek and Turkish. is of medium height and slender, with blond, silky hair and extremely fine, white skin. ... is blue eyes gaze mildly and with benevolence ... His arms and hands are long and finely articulated, but powerful ... e heartily enjoys every kind of hunting, both for large game ... and for hare and fowl. ... He enjoys training horses. ... He is very strong in battle with the lance ... n archery few are his equal ... He runs and jumps better than average he loves wrestling, even if many are superior to him ... e loves music very much ... He plays the lute surpassing all but very few. ... e tends more to cheerfulness than to melancholy ... He is opposed to suffering and only with great difficulty does he bring himself to mete out punishment ... Among his recognized fine qualities is his abstinent mode of life ... John Sigismund appointed a Calvinist bishop as the only religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by David and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, David published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity. John Sigismund and Hasan Pasha stormed into Upper Hungary in March 1567. However, John Sigismund was taken seriously ill in summer. The Transylvanian lords pledged to respect his last will when electing his successor. The Ottoman Sultan Selim II granted the Transylvanian lords the right to freely elect their monarch, only preserving the right to approve their decision. Before long, John Sigismund recovered. The Diet met again in Torda in early 1568 and authorized preachers to teach the Gospel according to their own understanding. The Diet also declared that nobody should suffer at the hands of others for religious reasons , stating that faith is a gift of God . The Edict of Torda expanded the limits of religious freedom far beyond the standard of 16th century Europe. The decree did not put a complete end to discrimination, because official status was granted only to the Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist clergymen, but Unitarian, Orthodox, Armenian, Jewish, and Muslim believers could also freely practise their religions. The Treaty of Adrianople, signed in February 1568, concluded the first war between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs. According to the treaty, John Sigismund retained all territories that he had conquered from Maximilian in the previous years. The envoy of the Ottoman Sultan Selim II in Paris suggested that John Sigismund should marry Margaret of Valois, but his proposal was ignored. Many theological discussions on the Trinity were organized in 1568, the first of them taking place in his presence in Gyulafehervar from 8 to 17 March. The growing influence of the Anti Trinitarians on John Sigismund became obvious in 1569. After Peter Karolyi, a Calvinist cleric, complained about John Sigismund's bias, John Sigismund accused the Calvinist bishop, Melius, of having persecuted non Calvinist priests, stating that Melius should not play the pope . The largest debate between the Calvinist and Anti Trinitarian, or Unitarian, theologians took place in Nagyvarad from 20 to 25 October 1569. Although neither side was declared winner, after the debate John Sigismund accepted Anti Trinitarian ideas, which made him the only Unitarian monarch in history. We wish that in our country ... freedom shall reign. We know furthermore that faith is a gift from God and that conscience cannot be constrained. And if does not abide by this, he may go to the other side of the Tisza. John Sigismund's words to Peter Karolyi After John Sigismund's conversion, most of his courtiers also adhered to Unitarianism. According to historian Gabor Barta, political factors also contributed to John Sigismund's conversion, because he found in Anti Trinitarianism the means through which he could express both his adherence to the Christian world and the distance from it . Istvan Keul says that the simplicity of the idea that There is but one God also contributed to the spread of Unitarianism, especially among the Szekely villagers and the townspeople of Kolozsvar. A religious enthusiast, Gyorgy Karacsony, stirred up many peasants in Partium to wage holy war against the Ottomans in 1569. They marched against Debrecen, but the neighboring noblemen routed them near the town in early 1570. Negotiations between John Sigismund and Maximilian concluded with the Treaty of Speyer, signed on 16 August 1570. John Sigismund acknowledged Maximilian as the sole king of Hungary and abandoned his own royal title. Instead, he adopted the new title Prince of Transylvania and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary , also confirming that his realm was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and would revert to Maximilian or Maximilian's heir after John Sigismund's death. John Sigismund, now gravely ill, ratified the treaty on 1 December. The last Diet to meet during his reign confirmed the decrees of previous Diets enhancing religious freedom. He died in Gyulafehervar on 14 March 1571, a few days after Maximilian had ratified the Treaty of Speyer. The Transylvanian lords kept his death secret for days. He was buried in St. Michael's Cathedral in Gyulafehervar, in accordance with Unitarian rite. John Sigismund had made his last testament and will in the presence of Chancellor Mihaly Csaky and Treasurer Gaspar Bekes during his earlier illness in the summer of 1567. Despite his recovery, he did not alter the text in the following years. He willed most of his wealth to his uncle, Sigismund August of Poland, and his three aunts, Sophia, Anna and Catherine. He bequeathed his library to the Protestant school of Gyulafehervar. John Sigismund, who never married and left no heir, was the last member of the Zapolya family. In his will, he assured the Diet of its right to choose the new monarch. The representatives of the Three Nations elected the Roman Catholic Stephen Bathory, who adopted the title Voivode of Transylvania. Gaspar Bekes, supported by Maximilian, contested the election, but Bathory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and consolidated his rule.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Sigismund%20Z%C3%A1polya
"Zapp also known as the Zapp Band or Zapp Roger is an American funk band that emerged from Dayton, Ohio, in 1977. Particularly influential in the electro subgenre of funk, Zapp were known for their trademark use of the talk box effect. The original line up consisted of four Troutman brothersfrontman Roger, Larry, Lester and Terryand non Troutman family members Bobby Glover, Gregory Jackson, Sherman Fleetwood, Jerome Derrickson, Eddie Barber and Jannetta Boyce. Zapp also worked closely with George Clinton and Bootsy Collins of Parliament Funkadelic during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1979. Zapp released its eponymous debut album in 1980, and achieved mainstream recognition from the single More Bounce to the Ounce . The group's follow up Zapp II was released in 1982, selling well and becoming certified gold. In the 1990s, Zapp would also be an influence on the regional G funk sound and the broader cultural scene of West Coast hip hop itself. The band disbanded in 1999 after the deaths of Roger and Larry Troutman in a murder suicide apparently carried out by Larry. Zapp reformed briefly in 2003 with the remaining brothers of the Troutman family to produce the album Zapp VI Back By Popular Demand. Born on November 29, 1951, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Roger Troutman began recording music in the late to mid 1960s, issuing his first solo recording efforts Jolly Roger and Night Time on the obscure and now defunct Ohio label, Teen Records in 1966 under the band name 'Lil' Roger and His Fabulous Vels. Although neither song received recognition due to its very limited release, Troutman and brothers pursued their music career throughout the 1970s, forming Roger The Human Body in 1976, on their privately owned label Troutman Bros. Records. Their own label allowed Troutman and the band to give a slightly wider and more high profile release of their own music, issuing their first and only album Introducing Roger in 1976. In the late 1970s Roger Troutman continued to record with his brothers, losing the name Roger The Human Body and adopting the Zapp nickname from his brother Terry in 1977. The group searching for recognition, began playing at various small venues locally around Ohio. The Troutman family had long standing friendships with Ohio natives Phelps Catfish Collins and William Earl Bootsy Collins, who had both been involved with Parliament Funkadelic in the early 1970s. Phelps and Bootsy were attendees at a performance, and were impressed with Zapp's musical abilities, prompting Bootsy to invite Roger to the United Sound Studios in Detroit the P Funk studio base which was frequently used by Parliament Funkadelic. Roger Troutman subsequently wrote and recorded the demo for More Bounce to the Ounce in 1978. George Clinton, the leader of Funkadelic liked the recording and encouraged Troutman to present the demo to Warner Bros. Records. Warner Bros. signed Zapp in early 1979, and on July 28, 1980, Zapp released their debut album, which was recorded by Roger and produced by Bootsy between 1979 and early 1980 at the United Sound Studios in Detroit, their first recording on a major label. The album's sound, which is highly influenced by Parliament Funkadelic, contrasts largely with Zapp's later releases. More Bounce to the Ounce reached number two on the Billboard Hot R B tracks for two weeks during the autumn of 1980. By November 18, 1980, Zapp had been certified gold by the RIAA. Bootsy Collins citing Clinton's influence toward creating the song 'More Bounce To The Ounce' After the 1980 release of Zapp's debut album, tensions rose between Roger Troutman and George Clinton. Troutman's solo album The Many Facets of Roger was primarily funded by Clinton, through CBS, and was slated to be released on his own Uncle Jam Records label. By the early 1980s, Clinton and his musical projects were experiencing financial troubles due to his poor management skills and shifting tastes in music. Around the time that Troutman's debut was due to be released, Warner Bros. Records dropped Clinton from their label. Funkadelic's final recording with Warner Bros., on which Troutman had worked briefly, was The Electric Spanking of War Babies. Under pressure from the label, it was cut from a double album to a single disc. Warner Bros. did not promote the release, which emerged in early 1981 and made little impact. Troutman could see the disarray surrounding Clinton and severed their partnership by accepting a higher offer for the demo recordings of his album from Warner Bros. With Clinton out of the picture, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's subsequent work. When The Many Facets of Roger was finally released in August 1981 it was on the Warner Bros. label. In Clinton's biography George Clinton For the Record, Troutman was quoted as off handedly commenting, ... Heck gee willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money . Clinton's view, expressed in his response, was that CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don't like to go into it on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , and a lot of people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling . The financial loss from the rupture with Troutman is credited as one of the factors that derailed Clinton's musical career and sent Funkadelic into hiatus. Zapp released its second album, Zapp II, on October 14, 1982. Electronic production techniques featured prominently, including liberal use of the talk box that became Troutman's signature. Despite the contrasting styles between the first and the second albums, Zapp II attained gold status by September 21, 1982. The album fared almost as well as Zapp's debut, peaking at number two on the Billboard R B chart, and reaching 25 on The Billboard 200 Albums chart. The single Dancefloor Part I peaked at number one on the R B singles chart of 1982. Zapp spawned several more albums in close succession, retaining the slick electronic style that Zapp II had adopted, but with diminishing success. Zapp III was released in 1983, and managed to gain a gold certification, but peaked at only 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R B chart. Zapp III's poorer commercial performance became a sign that the band's popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s, with post disco music falling out of trend. By the release of The New Zapp IV U in October 1985, the downward trajectory was evident. The album did not attain gold status until 1994, almost a decade after its initial release. Zapp's presence faded further in the latter half of the 1980s, as Troutman focused his attention on his solo career. The final release by Zapp before Troutman's death was Zapp V in September 1989, which achieved only moderate commercial success and failed to receive an RIAA certification. The increasingly dominant West Coast hip hop scene of the early to mid 1990s briefly brought Zapp and Roger back into the spotlight as their material came into favour as a source of samples for hip hop tracks. Troutman gained recognition for providing talk box backing vocals for both the original and remixed version of Tupac Shakur's 1995 96 comeback single California Love the alternate version of the music video features Troutman playing the keyboard and talk box during a party. Roger's involvement in California Love awarded him a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1997. On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as a result of an apparent murder suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear. Larry had been experiencing increasingly severe financial problems managing the family run housing company, Troutman Enterprises, which eventually filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy owing 400,000 in tax. Larry might also have been bitter after Roger fired him as manager of his music career, a position Larry had held for several years. During Roger's funeral, his nephew Clet Troutman performed a talk box rendition of Amazing Grace. Roger was survived by his six sons and five daughters his eldest son, Roger Lynch Troutman Jr., died of head injuries just a few years after the murder of his father January 31, 1970 January 22, 2003 . After Troutman's death, Ice Cube said that More Bounce To The Ounce introduced him to hip hop. I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, and he used to bring in his radio with these pop lockers. He used to teach the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard 'Rapper's Delight' yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain. The resulting impact of Roger and Larry's deaths left the band stranded, halting production. Without Roger serving as the creative source, they effectively disbanded, and quietly left the music industry altogether. Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label, bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close. A few years later, Zapp resurfaced for a short period after the establishment of its own independent label, Zapp Town Records, managed by the Troutman family.

"Evangelis or Evangelos Zappas Greek Romanian Evanghelie Zappa, 23 August 180019 June 1865 was a Greek patriot, philanthropist and businessman who spent most of his life in Romania. He is recognized today as one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, who sponsored the Olympic Games of 1859, 1870, 1875, and 1888 and preceded the Olympic Games that came under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. These Games, known at the time simply as Olympics, came before the founding of the International Olympic Committee. The legacy of Evangelis Zappas, as well as the legacy of his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, was also used to fund the Olympic Games of 1896. During his youth, Zappas joined the Greek War of Independence 18211832 , achieving the rank of Major and fighting in several significant battles. Following Greek independence, he moved to Wallachia where he had a successful career as a businessman, becoming one of the richest men of that time in Eastern Europe. Aside from being the only major sponsor of the Olympic revival at that time, Zappas's philanthropy also included contributions toward the foundation of several Greek institutions and schools as well as sports and exhibition facilities. Evangelis Zappas was born to Vasilis Zappas and Sotire Mexis, of a Greek ancestry in 1800 in the village of Labovo, near Tepelene, modern Gjirokaster County, Albania , when the region was still under Ottoman rule. Zappas did not receive any education during his childhood. He left his village at the age of 13 and enrolled as a mercenary in the Ottoman militia of the local ruler Ali Pasha. Zappas became a member of the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Eteria and joined his compatriots when the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821. During this period, Zappas reached the rank of Major in the revolutionary army and became a personal friend of the Souliot captain, Markos Botsaris. After Botsaris's death in 1823, Zappas served under various military commanders of the independence struggle, such as Dimitrios Panourgias, Kitsos Tzavelas, and Michail Spyromilios. He participated in several major conflicts, such as the siege of Souli, the first siege of Missolonghi and the Battle of Peta. In his later correspondence with a Greek official, he claimed that he was wounded five times during the war. In 1831, Zappas emigrated to Wallachia and made a fortune in land and agriculture. In the 1850s, Zappas was considered one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe. At the time of his death in 1865, his total wealth was estimated at six million gold drachmas. The idea of reviving the ancient Olympic Games had been raised from time to time during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by romanticism and patriotism. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work Dialogue of the Dead, proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition. In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived. Zappas was notably inspired by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition through his own efforts and resources. In early 1856, he sent a letter through diplomatic channels to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund the revival of the Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors. However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were a throwback to ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event. For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events. King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund. On 15 November 1859 the first Olympic Games was held, in a city square in central Athens. These athletic contests were the first Olympic Games of modern times with the provenance of ancient Greek roots and the intention of using an, as yet unready, ancient Greek stadium. That stadium, the Panathenaic Stadium, was first used for a modern Olympic Games in 1870 and for the first time since the ancient Panathenaic and Olympic Games. The athletes competed in a variety of disciplines, similar to that of the ancient Olympic Games running, discus, javelin throwing, wrestling, jumping, and pole climbing. Zappas left a fortune for the funding of future Olympiads to be held at the Panathenian stadium. He died in 1865. His immense fortune was used for the construction of permanent sporting facilities in Athens, as well as for the continuation of the Olympiad. He also instructed on the building of the Zappeion exhibition and conference center, which is named in his honour and that of his cousin Konstantinos Zappas. After Zappas's death, and wholly due to the Greek government ignoring Zappas's instructions to refurbish the stadium in marble, it was necessary to refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests and hosted the fencing events of 1896 , as well as an industrial exhibition that anti athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888. Dr. William Penny Brookes, from the United Kingdom, further developed his Olympian Class sports events held in Much Wenlock in the 1850s, by adopting some events from the 1859 Athens Olympic Games into the programme of future Wenlock Olympian Games. Baron Pierre de Coubertin from Paris, France, was, in part, inspired by Dr. Brookes, and went on to found the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Professor David C. Young, of the University of Florida Gainesville , noted Had it not been for Zappas, the Athens Games of 1896 surely would not have taken place. Zappas's actions, his will and the previous tradition of Zappas Olympic Games had made Constantine an advocate of Olympic Games before the formation of the IOC in 1894. Apart from his efforts to revive the Olympics, Evangelos Zappas made several philanthropic donations towards the foundation of schools, libraries and other similar institutions all over the Ottoman occupied world, and notably their birthplace, Epirus. Greek schools were founded and expanded in several Greek populated villages and towns, such as Labovo, Lekli, Nivani, Dhroviani, Filiates, Delvina, Permet. In Constantinople, education facilities were also founded that included nurseries, primary and secondary schools, which were collectively known as the Zappeion Institute. Moreover, a large amount of money was deposited in the National Bank of Greece to provide scholarships for Greek agricultural students in order to conduct postgraduate studies in Western Europe. During the anti Greek Istanbul Pogrom in 1955, the facilities of the Zappeion female college in the Turkish capital were vandalized by the fanatical mob and a statue of him was broken into pieces. Evangelis Zappas was often described as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, he was a man of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos%20Zappas
"Zapresic pronounced is a city in Zagreb County in Croatia. Its newest population is 19,644 inhabitants for the city proper, and over 51,000 for its seven municipality metropolitan area. Zapresic is the third largest, and most densely populated division of the county. It is located northwest of the Croatian capital Zagreb, and near the Slovenian border. It is centered on plains north of the Sava River, and is bordered by Medvednica Mountain to the east, and the Marija Gorica Hills to the west. The first human settlement in, and near Zapresic dates from the Neolithic, and several Roman roads were constructed in the area. The first records of the modern town date from 1334. Since that date, the town's history includes being a part of a feudal estate to operating the first meat packaging plant in Croatia. However, it was not formally established as a city until 1995. The city is governed by a mayor, a city government of seven members upper house , and a city council of twenty one lower house . Zapresic has its own fire department, but police coverage is provided by the city of Zagreb. Komunalno poduzece Zapresic manages all utilities except electricity. Tap water in Zapresic is of high quality. Due to its many rail, and road transport corridors, Zapresic has been dubbed the northwestern gate to Zagreb County . It lies directly next to the A2 highway connecting Zagreb to Central Europe. It also is adjacent to the main railway leading northwest out of Zagreb. Centered on the tertiary sector, the city's economy is booming due to a large population influx. Zapresic's educational facilities range from kindergartens to centers of higher education. The city is home to four elementary schools, one high school, and two universities. The Zapresic metropolitan area contains six castles that together make up what is known as the palace path. The town also has a museum and an art gallery. The most popular sport in the region is football, and the local team is NK Inter Zapresic, a member of the First Football League of Croatia. Other sports are also present in Zapresic, and the city is home to a golf resort. The first records of human inhabitants in the Zapresic metropolitan area date back to the Neolithic, evident through stone axes found in Brdovec, and axes from the Copper Age found in Marija Gorica. Halstatt culture traces were uncovered in the area of Sveti Kriz. The Romans left their imprints on Zapresic in the form of the SisciaNeviodunumEmona road, which followed Sava River on its left bank through the Zapresic area, passing near modern settlements. After a lack of records from the first millennium, Zapresic again became known in the late 11th century. In 1094, following the formation of the Zagreb Diocese, Aca, an advisor of the CroatoHungarian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain to protect the newly formed diocese. Zapresic became part of the SusedgradStubica manor, the second biggest estate in the Croato Hungarian Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zapresic, marking the first evidence of the modern settlement of Zapresic. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on important trade and transit routes. This was corroborated by the route of the first railway in Croatia, which passes through Zapresic. During 15th and 16th centuries, refugees from Lika came to Zapresic to escape the Ottomans. Some of these refugees were the so called Brdovec Franciscans, for whom Lord Zylagy of Susedgrad built an abbey in Marija Gorica. The refugees brought the Ikavian accent, which was preserved for a long time in some small Zapresic communities, although the Zapresic area has historically been Ekavian Kajkavian yat being or rather than . The area was hit hard by the 1573 peasant revolt, led by Matija Gubec, who, according to historian Ivan Kukuljevic Sakcinski, managed the estate of Jablanovec, part of modern Zapresic. One of the revolt leaders was Ilija Gregoric, a resident of Marija Gorica. Two years later, the large manor of Susedgrad and Stubica started to disperse into many small estates owned by low level members of the nobility. Dozens of simple diocesan curia houses serve as a reminder of this nobility. In 1903, Zapresic railway station was a sight of two anti Hungarian demonstrations caused by installing of panes with Hungarian inscriptions on railway objects across Croatia. The demonstrations were part of a wider national movement that swept the country at a time. In both occasions the demonstrations turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injured by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards were placed on the building of Zapresic railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded. Zapresic was formally established for the first time in 1952, when the Municipality of Zapresic Croatian Opcina Zapresic was formed. The municipality operated as part of the Zagreb kotar and later City of Zagreb. The City of Zapresic Grad Zapresic was incorporated on 30 November 1995. On that day, parts of the surrounding municipalities of Pusca, and Hrusevec Kupljenski which was disbanded, leaving only a namesake settlement and the City of Zagreb were incorporated into a new City of Zapresic. The settlement of Merenje came under the jurisdiction of Zapresic on 17 January 1997. Zapresic is a part of the metropolitan area of Croatia's capital and largest city, Zagreb. It is located 18 kilometres 11 mi northwest of Zagreb, lying near the confluence of the Krapina River, and the Sava River. The small Luznica River marks the western city border of Zapresic. The Zapresic metropolitan area consists of Zapresic and seven surrounding municipalities Brdovec, Bistra, Dubravica, Jakovlje, Luka, Marija Gorica, and Pusca. It is formed by the northwestern part of Zagreb County, bordered on the south by the Sava River, on the east by Zagreb, and the Medvednica Mountain, and on the west by the Sutla River, and the Slovenian border. According to the official website, three distinct geographic areas make up the Zapresic area the western part of the Medvednica Mountain, the Marija Gorica Hills and the plains that lie between. The western part of the Medvednica Mountain is fairly lightly inhabited, with no settlements except at the base of the mountain. These include the Bistra municipality and the Zapresic settlement of Jablanovec. The Marija Gorica Hills are located mainly in the Marija Gorica municipality between the rivers of Krapina, and Sutla. The third area, the plains, is the area where the Zapresic itself is located. Zapresic has a lake, Lake Zajarki, situated between the town and the Sava River in the south. It is colloquially known as Bager Croatian word for excavator . The lake is currently still used as a gravel pit, although it is a known destination for Zapresic swimmers and beach goers, as well as local people and foreign tourists who do recreational fishing. Fishing activities on lake Zajarki are regulated by Srd Saran, Zapresic. In 2017. the picnic zone was built on eastern side of a big lake which includes barbeque houses and beach volleyball, handball and football fields. According to the 2011 census, the town of Zapresic has 25,223 inhabitants, 19,644 of whom live in the Zapresic settlement naselje . This makes Zapresic urban area at 1,036 inhabitants per square kilometer 2,683 per square mile the most densely populated in the whole of Zagreb County. The town is administratively divided into nine settlements, the largest of which is also called Zapresic, covering a third of the town's area. The metropolitan area of Zapresic had 54,640 inhabitants in 2011, an increase from 51,040 inhabitants in 2001. About 96 of inhabitants are Croats and 98.3 speak Croatian as their mother tongue. The sex ratio is 90.63 men to 100 women, and the median age is 39.9 years, which makes Zapresic one of the younger towns in Zagreb County. According to the 1910 census in Croatia, town of Zapresic had 5,058 inhabitants, which were linguisticaly and religiously declared as this total 5,058 total 5,058 Due to its accessible location with favorable conditions for expansion, and a very high net migration, and population growth rates estimated to be 29 persons per 1,000 per year , Zapresic is expecting an economic boom. Despite the ongoing financial crisis that hit many cities in Croatia, including the capital, the town operates without loans and expects a yearly budget increase in the range of 20 to 30 percent. The tertiary sector is dominant with mainly retailing, and hospitality, and a smaller presence of tourism, as well as souvenir manufacturing and financial services. The secondary sector is also present with ceramic industry Inker as of 2006 part of Roca , metalworking Karbon Nova, Lanac, and Unija metali and chemical industry Messer Croatia plin, Montkemija . The primary sector mainly consists of agriculture, and is expected to continue shrinking. There are currently 3,040 hectares 7,512 acres of arable land for agricultural use, but the town's general urban plan anticipates an economic shift will lower the amount of agricultural use to 930 hectares 2,298 acres by 2015, thus speeding the process of suburbanization started by the expansion of Zagreb. The future of Zapresic's economy is seen in the development of small, and mid sized businesses, tourism, and food related industries. The city income tax rate is 12 percent. The city budget in 2008 amounted to HRK 198 million. The Shopping City Zagreb also called West Gate Shopping Center is a shopping mall planned to create a major job demand in the Zapresic region. Located next to the Krapina River and A2 highway, the center serves 2.3 million residents in the Zagreb region. It will also be the largest in the Zagreb metropolitan area with 100,000 square meters 1,080,000 sq ft of gross leasable area. Construction started in late 2007. It was opened in October 2009. Zapresic's cultural heritage includes a series of six historic castles and palaces known as the palace path Croatian staza dvoraca Luznica mansion, Janusevac palace, Laduc mansion, Orsic family mansion, Jakovlje palace, and Novi Dvori. Of these, Orsic and Janusevec are in the zeroth category of cultural heritage preservation of UNESCO, Luznica is in the first category of the Croatian Ministry of Culture, and Laduc and Novi Dvori are in the second category of the Ministry of Culture. Jakovlje palace is not involved in any cultural preservation program. Novi Dvori also known as Novi Dvori Jelacicevi New Jelacic Palace is known for being the residence of Josip Jelacic, one of the most famous Croatian bans. However, before that it was inhabited by five families the last one being Erdody after its construction in 1611 as a simple two story house. It remains a well preserved example of a manorial estate. The palace was left to the state in 1934 by Josip Jelacic's nephew and nieces. The town is home to the Museum of Matija Skurjeni opened in 1984 , a gallery of works by the renowned painter. It is located in the former granary of Novi Dvori.

Despite the settlement of Zapresic's long history, only with the founding of the Town of Zapresic on 30 November 1995 did it have its own elected representatives. The towns administration includes two tiers of power a mayor and a city council. The city council is elected each four years. The mayor Croatian gradonacelnik has executive power. He is elected directly by the voters. Current Mayor is Zeljko Turk Croatian Democratic UnionHDZ, elected in 2006, re elected 2009, 2013 and 2017 , whose deputys are Damir Bencevic and Alan Labus. Zapresic is part of the 1st Croatian electoral district, which consists of western Zagreb, and the Zapresic metropolitan area. The city council Croatian gradsko vijece has the legislative power over the town. It represents the residents of Zapresic and manages city budget, and it is composed of twenty one members with one presiding and two vice presiding members. The Town of Zapresic provides education ranging from pre school to higher education. These include four registered kindergartens stationed on seven locations , four elementary schools, one high school, and one college. Elementary schools located in Zapresic include Antun Augustincic, Ljudevit Gaj, and Kupljenovo elementary schools, and a branch of the Bistra elementary school from the Bistra municipality. The Ban Josip Jelacic High School is located on the Franjo Tuman Square in the northwestern part of the town. Zapresic has a University of Applied Sciences which offers courses in business and management, named after the Croatian historian and theologian Baltazar Adam Krcelic, and located in the town center on Novak Street. The open university in Zapresic Croatian Pucko otvoreno uciliste Zapresic offers various courses in languages, computer science, and musical instruments, as well as vocational training. Zapresic is covered mostly by the postal code 10290 Zapresic , and Croatian Mail operates four post offices in the city in Ivanec Bistranski, Luznica, Sibice and Zapresic. The city proper overlaps with the areas of postal codes 10294 Donja Pusca Pojatno , 10295 Kupljenovo Hrusevec Kupljenski, Kupljenovo, Merenje and 10298 Donja Bistra Jablanovec . Zapresic has its own police station, PP Zapresic, a Zagreb County branch of the City of Zagreb Police Department responsible for all of the Zapresic metropolitan area. Fire coverage is provided by the City of Zapresic Fire Department Croatian Javna vatrogasna postrojba grada Zapresica , which also serves the complete seven municipality metropolitan area. There are six volunteer fire brigades in Zapresic proper, all members of the Zapresic Firefighting Community Croatian Vatrogasna zajednica Grada Zapresica . Zapresic also has a municipal court. All utilities except electricity are managed by Komunalno poduzece Zapresic English Utility company Zapresic . Zapresic's electricity is, as in the rest of Croatia, provided by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, and distributed by Elektra Zagreb, a company managing access to electricity in Zagreb, and Zagreb County. Zapresic receives tap water from underground water reserves through a water pump in the settlement of Sibice. The water from the water pump is of drinking quality. However, local factories Pliva, and Kvasac produce waste water, which is released into the Sava River through the Harmica Pliva Zapresic water treatment plant. Before the construction of the treatment plant, the polluted water was piped into the Gorjak Creek, endangering the tap water quality. Possible consequences of releasing waste water into the Sava will be dealt with by the construction of the Zajarki water purification system for screening the used water. The ecological problem is multiplied by the fact that the utility company received only 400 requests to clean septic tanks in 2007, although most households in the relatively rural surroundings of Zapresic use septic systems. There are plans of constructing four hydroelectric power plants around Zagreb with one being in Zapresic HE Zapresic, also known as HE Podsused as a part of a system of exploiting natural resources of the Sava River. The town is a major transport hub for the area of Zagreb County and Zagreb itself. It is thus known as the northwestern gate to Zagreb County. The Zagreb bypass, and the tolled A2 highway ZagrebMacelj, toward Austria part of European Route E59, and pan European corridor Xa pass through the eastern part of Zapresic, providing Zapresic with highway access at a cloverleaf interchange. The State Route D225 is a major arterial road in Zapresic. It forms the Pavao Loncar and Marshal Tito Streets, leading west towards Brdovec, Marija Gorica and Slovenia, and east towards western Zagreb, Jablanovec, and Stubica. According to the current city urbanistic plan, the traffic on the D225 will be re routed through two city bypasses along the northern and western railway lines to clear the center of Zapresic of 25,000 daily commuters driving on a two lane road. Mass transit provides intra city and inter city connections in form of bus and rail. Zapresic is a major railway intersection, with railways leading west to Slovenia Corridor X , north to Zabok, and Kumrovec Corridor Xa and east to the main regional railway hub Zagreb. Croatian Railways services the Zapresic train station with major interstate trains going to the west, but also with the suburban line Savski MarofZagreb Main StationDugo Selo. The town is serviced by two bus companies the regional Zagrebacki elektricni tramvaj ZET and local Mestrovic prijevoz. ZET operates line 172 to Zapresic, which starts at the Crnomerec bus terminal in Zagreb and runs every 8 to 15 minutes during day, and at irregular intervals during the night. Lines 176 and 177 run to the Zapresic suburban municipality of Bistra. Mestrovic prijevoz, the main intra city bus company of Zapresic, operates bus lines connecting Zapresic and all municipalities in its metropolitan area. Zapresic lies along the left bank of the Sava River, but it does not have any bridges that would connect the town to Samobor, on the other bank, as the nearest bridge is the Podsused bridge, located in the Podsused Vrapce district of Zagreb. However, two ferries connect Zapresic with the roads in Medsave and Samoborski Otok, small villages near Samobor. The widest river in the area, the Sava River, used to be navigable up to Krsko, Slovenia in Roman times. However, it is, as of 2009 , navigable only up to Rugvica, leaving Zapresic with no more possibility of river transport. The city does not have a port on any of its rivers. To establish better transport capabilities, and create a solid ground for the emerging air sports that are already available in the town e.g. hang gliding or paragliding , an airport is planned northeast of the city, between the Krapina River and the railroad. The land at this location is unused, uninhabited, and administratively selected for sports and recreation. The arrangement of the runways, taxiways, air traffic control building, hangar, and other necessary buildings have already been determined. The airport is intended to serve primarily as a sports airport, for teaching flying, and for charter flights. As of January 2009 the date when the construction starts had not yet been announced. A known historical resident of Zapresic was Count Josip Jelacic of Buzim 180159 , the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia then Habsburg Monarchy , he received an estate in Zapresic together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelacic riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelacic Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power and orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking the start of the democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zapresic credits Jelacic with a major arterial road named in his honor. Baltazar Adam Krcelic 171578 , a historian, theologian, legal expert, and a canon in Zagreb, lived in what became the Zapresic metropolitan area. Actually born in Senkovec, Brdovec, he was the rector of the Croatian language course in Vienna. He wrote 757 books in Latin, and the Kajkavian dialect of Croatian. The Illyrian movement of Slavic independence in Croatia can also be traced to Zapresic through two of its citizens Ivan Perkovac 182671 , publicist from Harmica, Brdovec, editor of Vijenac and Pozor, secretary of Matica hrvatska, and a member of Sabor, the Croatian parliament and Pavao Stoos 180662 , a poet, a priest, and an important member of the Illyrian movement from Dubravica. Ante Kovacic 185489 from Marija Gorica lived in the aftermath of the Illyrian movement, but nevertheless became a fruitful writer. His most important work is U registraturi English In the Registry , a novel following the life of Ivica Kicmanovic, a peasant who is raised in a village and goes to live in a large city. Zapresic's recent history includes several known Croatian public figures, such as Matija Skurjeni 18981990 , a Croatian naive painter who lived in Zapresic from 1953 until his death. He was a co founder of the Croatian Society of Naive Painters. An art gallery with his works was opened in Zapresic in 1987. This art gallery changed to a museum in 2000. Other well known inhabitants include Davor Gobac b. 1964 , the frontman of Psihomodo Pop. Although he was born in Karlovac, he is a resident of Zapresic Davor Vukovic b. 1951 , a painter and poet from Herceg Novi, residing in Zapresic and Mira Vlahovic, an opera singer. Vlahovic sang at the Croatian National Theater. The music scene in Zapresic includes Connect, a hip hop band formed in Zapresic. Connect is the creator of the Croatian football hip hop hymn Samo je jedno . Croatian politician and current Croatian Minister of Interior, Davor Bozinovic, also resides in Zapresic.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapre%C5%A1i%C4%87
"Zara was a heavy cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina Royal Navy , the lead ship of the Zara class. Named after the Italian city of Zara now Zadar, Croatia , the ship was built at the Odero Terni Orlando shipyard beginning with her keel laying in July 1928, launching in April 1930, and commissioning in October 1931. Armed with a main battery of eight 8 inch 200 mm guns, she was nominally within the 10,000 long ton 10,000 t limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, though in reality she significantly exceeded this figure. Zara saw extensive service during the first two years of Italy's participation in World War II, having taken part in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the 1st Division. She was present during the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, the Battle of Taranto in November 1940, and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. In the last engagement, Zara and her sister ships Fiume and Pola were sunk in a close range night engagement with three British battleships. Most of her crew, 783 officers and sailors, including the divisional commander Admiral Carlo Cattaneo, were killed in the sinking. Zara was 182.8 meters 600 ft long overall, with a beam of 20.62 m 67.7 ft and a draft of 7.2 m 24 ft . She displaced 14,300 long tons 14,500 t at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the 10,000 long ton 10,000 t restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. Her power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. Her engines were rated at 95,000 shaft horsepower 71,000 kW and produced a top speed of 32 knots 59 km h 37 mph . She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men. She was protected with an armored belt that was 150 mm 5.9 in thick amidships. Her main deck was 70 mm 2.8 in thick and there was a secondary deck 20 mm 0.79 in thick over the main one. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides. Zara was armed with a main battery of eight 203 mm 8.0 in Mod 29 53 caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 100 mm 4 in 47 cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers Terni 40 mm 39 guns in single mounts and eight 12.7 mm 0.50 in guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow. Zara's secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm and 12.7 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s, and eight 37 mm 1.5 in 54 cal. guns and eight 13.2 mm 0.52 in guns were installed in their place. Two 120 mm 4.7 in 15 cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. Zara's keel was laid down on 4 July 1928 at the Odero Terni Orlando OTO shipyard at Muggiano, La Spezia she was launched on 27 April 1930, and her construction was completed on 20 October 1931. During sea trials, Zara reached a speed of 35.23 kn 65.25 km h 40.54 mph , but this was with the ship's machinery forced to give 120,690 shp 90,000 kW . This was not representative of in service performance, however, and normal maximum at sea speed was about 29 kn 54 km h 33 mph . The ship was presented with her battle flag in her namesake city, now Zadar, Croatia. In August 1932, Zara took part in fleet training exercises in the Gulf of Naples King Victor Emmanuel III came aboard the ship on the 13th. She became the flagship of the First Naval Squadron in September. She took part in a naval review held for Benito Mussolini in the Gulf of Naples on 67 July 1933. Zara participated in another review on 27 November 1936, and Victor Emmanuel III, his son Umberto II, Mussolini, and the Regent of Hungary, Miklos Horthy, all came aboard the ship. Another fleet review was held for the German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, the German minister of defense, on 7 June 1937. On 16 September, the commander of the squadron transferred his flag to the battleship Conte di Cavour. A final peacetime naval review took place on 5 May 1938, held for the visit of Adolf Hitler. On 7 March 1939, Zara and her sister ships sortied from Taranto to intercept a squadron of Republican warshipsthree cruisers and eight destroyersattempting to reach the Black Sea. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede the progress of the Spanish ships and force them to dock at Augusta, Sicily. The Spanish commander refused and instead steamed to Bizerte in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned. A month later, from 7 to 9 April, Zara supported the Italian invasion of Albania without incident. She was in port in Genoa for Navy Day on 10 June she spent the rest of 1939 uneventfully. At Italy's entrance into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Zara was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Matteucci. The division also included her sisters Gorizia and Fiume and the four Oriani class destroyers. At the time, the division was based in Taranto the ships were immediately sent to patrol off the island of Crete, and on 1112 June, the ships were attacked by an unknown submarine, which the destroyers unsuccessfully counterattacked. On 21 June, Zara and the rest of the division were transferred to Augusta, Sicily to be better positioned to intercept Allied convoys in the Mediterranean. The following day, the 1st Division joined a patrol with the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, though they failed to find any Allied vessels. Zara was present at the Battle of Calabria on 9 July. On 30 July, the 1st Division escorted a convoy to Benghazi and Tripoli in Italian Libya, arriving back in Augusta on 1 August. Gunnery training off Naples followed on 16 August, and on 29 August the ships left Naples for Taranto, arriving the next day. On the 31st, the 1st Division sortied to intercept the British convoys in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the attack without encountering the merchant ships. Zara returned to Taranto, and was present during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 1112 November. She was undamaged during the British attack. In the aftermath of the attack, the Italian command decided to disperse the fleet to protect them from further attacks Zara was sent to La Spezia for periodic maintenance on the 12th. The work lasted until 9 December, and she steamed south to Naples the following day. British bombing of the port four days later forced the Italians to again relocate the cruisers, sending them first to La Maddalena in Sardinia on 15 December and then back to Naples on the 19th. They stayed there for three days before proceeding to Taranto on 22 December. That month, Admiral Carlo Cattaneo came aboard Zara as the new commander of the division. Training exercises with Gorizia followed on 29 January and continued into the next month, when Pola joined them on 13 February. In mid March, Zara, Pola, and Fiume conducted gunnery training in the Gulf of Taranto. By this time, Pola had replaced Gorizia in the 1st Division. The Italian fleet made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in the eastern Mediterranean south of Crete in late March. This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 2729 March. For most of the daytime engagement, Pola and the rest of the 3rd Division were stationed on the disengaged side of the Italian fleet, and so did not see action during this phase. Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by British aircraft from the carrier Formidable and was forced to withdraw, and the 3rd Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet to screen against another possible British attack. A second British airstrike later on the 28th failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead scored a single torpedo strike on Pola, hitting her amidships on her starboard side. In the confusion of the attack, Pola had nearly collided with Fiume and had been forced to stop, which had prevented her from taking evasive action. The damage filled three compartments with water and disabled five of her boilers and the main steam line that fed the turbines, leaving her immobilized. Admiral Iachino, the fleet commander, was unaware of Pola's plight until 20 10 upon learning of the situation he detached Zara, Fiume, and four destroyers to protect Pola. At around the same time, the British cruiser HMS Orion detected Pola on her radar and reported her location. The British fleet, centered on the battleships Valiant, Warspite, and Barham, was at this point only 50 nmi 93 km 58 mi away. The British ships, guided by radar, closed in on the Italians at 22 10, Pola was about 6 nautical miles 11 km 6.9 mi from Valiant. Lookouts on the crippled Italian cruiser spotted shapes approaching and assumed them to be friendly vessels, so they fired a red flare to guide them. Almost twenty minutes later, the British illuminated first Zara and then Fiume with their searchlights the British battleships obliterated Zara, Fiume, and two destroyers in a point blank engagement. Zara had been hit by four broadsides from Warspite and five more from Valiant in the span of just a few minutes. The destroyer HMAS Stuart launched torpedoes at the crippled Zara and scored at least one hit. The destroyer Havock launched four more torpedoes with unknown results. The British battleships then turned away to avoid a torpedo attack from the remaining destroyers. Zara, by now burning furiously, remained afloat and drifted near the immobilized Pola. Zara's commander decided at 02 00 that his ship could not be saved, and so ordered the crew to scuttle the ship. At around the same time, the destroyer Jervis arrived on the scene and fired three torpedoes at Zara. The demolition charges exploded in the magazines at 02 30, and within ten minutes, the ship capsized and sank. Most of her crew, some 783 men including Cattaneo, were killed in the sinking. Zara was formally stricken from the naval register on 18 October 1946. Coordinates 3520N 2057E 35.333N 20.950E 35.333 20.950",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian%20cruiser%20Zara
"SMS Zara was a torpedo cruiser of the Austro Hungarian Navy, the lead ship of the Zara class. She was laid down in August 1878, launched in November 1879, and commissioned into the fleet in July 1882. The ship was armed with a battery of light guns and four torpedo tubes. She proved to be poorly designed, being too slow for use as a fleet scout or as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats, so she saw little active service. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, she was frequently in reserve, being activated infrequently to participate in training exercises. She served as a guard ship in Cattaro Bay for most of World War I, before being withdrawn for use as a cadet training ship in June 1917. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in 1918, and was ceded to Italy as a war prize in 1920. The Italian Navy had no use for the vessel, and sold her to ship breakers in 1921. Zara was 62.71 meters 205 ft 9 in long overall, with a beam of 8.22 m 27 ft 0 in and a draft of 4.1 m 13 ft 5 in . She displaced 833 long tons 846 t . The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of two cylinder vertical compound steam engines manufactured by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino STT , with steam provided by five cylindrical fire tube boilers. On trials, Zara reached a speed of 14.29 knots 26.47 km h 16.44 mph from 1,800 metric horsepower 1,800 ihp , though her average top speed was 14.02 knots 25.97 km h 16.13 mph . Her crew numbered 13 officers and 135 enlisted men. The ship's gun armament consisted of four 9 centimeter 3.5 in 24 caliber cal. Breech loading guns in single mounts, along with one 7 cm 2.8 in 15 cal. breech loading gun and two 25 mm 0.98 in Nordenfelt guns. She was also armed with four torpedo tubes. The torpedo tubes were located singly, two in the bow and at either beam. Zara was protected with a thin 19 mm 0.75 in armored deck. The keel for Zara was laid down on 1 August 1878 at the government shipyard in Pola. She was launched on 13 November 1879, after which STT delivered her engines. Zara's construction marked the first major use of domestically produced Bessemer steel by the Austro Hungarian Navy. Initial sea trials were scheduled for 28 and 29 April 1881, but a severe storm delayed them until 6 May. On her speed trials, she reached an average speed of 14.12 knots 26.15 km h 16.25 mph , less than her designed speed of at least 15 knots 28 km h 17 mph . The naval engineer A. Waldvogel proposed replacing the bronze screw with a larger steel one to increase her speed, though during sea trials held between 14 and 24 November, she only reached an average of 14.02 knots 25.97 km h 16.13 mph with the new screw at full power. On 17 July 1882, Zara was commissioned into the Austro Hungarian fleet. Upon entering service, Zara was found to have several significant defects she rolled badly, was insufficiently ventilated, and her bow mounted torpedo tube did not work as effectively as intended. She was also too slow for use as a reconnaissance vessel or a leader of a torpedo boat flotilla. As a result, she saw little active service. In September, Zara participated in a demonstration of the fleet's torpedo vessels for Kaiser Franz Joseph I in Pola. Franz Joseph came aboard Zara to observe a group of torpedo boats launch an attack against an old schooner. In 1885, the bow torpedo launcher was rebuilt, and in 1886 she was assigned to the torpedo training school. That year, a 47 mm 1.9 in Hotchkiss gun was installed on her bow. Four more 47 mm guns, of the quick firing L 33 type, were added in 1887, with two on each broadside. Zara spent much of her career in reserve, activated periodically to take part in training exercises. She was placed in reserve in 1888, but was reactivated temporarily in 1889 to take part in the summer training cruise. She remained out of service from 1890 to 17 March 1894, when she was recommissioned to assist a British steamship, SS Palmyra, which had run aground off Medolino. This work was completed by 1 April, after which Zara was again laid up. She returned to service with the torpedo school in 1897, and the following year she was re boilered. Work was finished in 1899 and sea trials were conducted from 14 to 26 August, during which Zara reached a speed of 10.94 knots 20.26 km h 12.59 mph . The ship was placed back in reserve in 1900. The following year, she participated in the summer training cruise. She spent 1902 in reserve, but served in the torpedo school from 1903 to 1906, during which time she was converted fully into a training ship. She conducted training cruises along the Dalmatian coast from 1907 to 16 September 1913. On 14 October, she was reduced to a tender for the torpedo school, a role she held to May 1914. She was assigned to the training school for naval cadets on 21 May, but this service was short lived. She was converted into a guard ship on 28 June and stationed in Cattaro Bay, the same day that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, the catalyst for the start of World War I a month later. She served in that role until June 1917. She returned to the cadet training school, and on 18 June left Cattaro for Pola. At 12 55 while cruising off the island of Lacroma, an accidental explosion tore a large hole in the bow, though the damage was above the waterline, allowing Zara to make port in Ragusa. The shipyard there effected temporary repairs to ensure her hull was strong enough to allow her to continue on to Pola, which she reached on 26 June. In Pola, a commission determined that the cause of the explosion was a badly deteriorated warhead in one of her two torpedoes, though some later sources state she struck a naval mine. After her bow was permanently repaired, Zara served in the training school until the end of the war in November 1918. With Austria Hungary's defeat, the Allies seized most of the Austro Hungarian fleet as war prizes, and Zara was allocated to Italy, which scrapped her by 1921.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20Zara
"The Zara class was a group of four heavy cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina Royal Navy in the late 1920s and the early 1930s. The class comprised the vessels Zara, Fiume, Gorizia, and Pola, the last of which was completed to a slightly different design. The ships were a substantial improvement over the preceding Trento class cruisers, incorporating significantly heavier armor protection at the cost of the very high speed of the Trentos. They carried the same main battery of eight 203 mm 8.0 in guns and had a maximum speed of 32 knots 59 km h 37 mph . Among the best protected heavy cruisers built by any navy in the 1930s, the heavy armor was acquired only by violating the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruiser displacement to 10,000 long tons 10,160 t . All four ships served with the main fleet in the interwar period, where they were primarily occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, Gorizia evacuated Italian nationals and Pola took part in non intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces. The ships took part in the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, and in the latter engagement, Zara, Pola, and Fiume were all sunk in a one sided night action with three British battleships. Gorizia continued in service, seeing further action at the First and Second Battles of Sirte. She was seriously damaged by American heavy bombers in April 1943 and towed to La Spezia, where she was still under repair when Italy surrendered in September. Germany seized the ship when they occupied the port, and Italian commandos unsuccessfully attempted to sink her in June 1944. In poor condition by the end of the war, the postwar Italian Navy decided to sell the ship for scrap in 1947. While the preceding Trento class of heavy cruisers were still being built, elements of the Italian naval command began to doubt the effectiveness of the new vessels, which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds. They advocated a more balanced design that would incorporate more comprehensive armor, with a main belt that was 200 millimeters 7.9 in thick, while retaining the battery of eight 203 mm 8.0 in guns and a speed of at least 32 knots 59 km h 37 mph . The designers quickly found that these characteristics could not be incorporated into a vessel that remained within the 10,000 long tons 10,160 t limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The naval command agreed to allow the new ships to exceed the displacement limits, but instructed the designers to eliminate unnecessary features to save as much weight as possible. As a result, the belt armor was reduced in thickness and the planned torpedo tubes were removed. The flush deck of the Trentos was abandoned, with the ships instead incorporating a forecastle deck and a stepped down main deck. In addition, the Zara design would be powered by just two propellers driven by lightweight machinery, unlike the four shaft arrangement used in the Trentos. Nevertheless, the ships still exceeded the displacement limit by at least 1,300 long tons 1,300 t . By 1928, the work was finished on what would become the Zara class, and the first two ships, Zara and Fiume, were ordered for the 19281929 building program. Gorizia followed in the 19291930 construction year, and Pola was ordered under the 19301931 program. All four ships were named for formerly Austro Hungarian cities that were annexed to Italy in the aftermath of World War I. The ships of the Zara class were 179.6 meters 589 ft long at the waterline and 182.8 m 600 ft long overall. They had a beam of 20.62 m 67.7 ft and a draft of 7.2 m 24 ft . The ships had a standard displacement of 11,326 to 11,712 long tons 11,508 to 11,900 t , and displaced 13,944 to 14,330 long tons 14,168 to 14,560 t at full load, with Fiume being the lightest of the four and Gorizia the heaviest. The first three ships were built with light superstructures as a weight saving measure, but Pola, intended to serve as a flagship, received a much larger bridge structure to accommodate an admiral's staff. All four ships received two tripod masts, with the forward mast erected over the bridge. They had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men. The ships carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow. The ships' power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil fired Thornycroft boilers, with the exception of Fiume, which received Yarrow boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships. Their engines were rated at 95,000 shaft horsepower 71,000 kW and produced a top speed of 32 knots 59 km h 37 mph , though on sea trials all four vessels significantly exceeded those figures, reaching a minimum of 118,000 shp 88,000 kW and speeds of 33 to 34 knots 61 to 63 km h 38 to 39 mph . Nevertheless, in service, their practical speeds were in the range of 31 to 32 knots 57 to 59 km h 36 to 37 mph . The vessels each carried 2,300 to 2,400 long tons 2,300 to 2,400 t of fuel oil, which allowed them to steam for 4,850 to 5,400 nautical miles 8,980 to 10,000 km 5,580 to 6,210 mi at a cruising speed of 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph . When operating at maximum speed, their operational radius fell to 1,150 to 1,900 nautical miles 2,130 to 3,520 km 1,320 to 2,190 mi , though due to the fact that Italian naval vessels were intended to operate only within the narrow confines of the Mediterranean Sea, their relatively short cruising range was not a significant problem. The Zaras were armed with a main battery of eight 203 mm 8.0 in Mod 29 53 caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. The guns fired 125 kilogram 276 lb shells at a muzzle velocity of 940 meters per second 3,080 ft s , with a rate of fire of about three and a half rounds per minute. The turrets allowed elevation to 45 degrees, which provided a maximum range of 31,500 meters 34,400 yd . Each ship carried 157 shells per gun. Like the Trentos, the Zara class ships suffered from shell dispersion that hampered accuracy. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells. In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together this caused the shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to the dispersion problem. In an attempt to rectify the dispersion problem, the guns were supplied with modified shells that fired at 900 meters per second 3,000 ft s . Anti aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 100 mm 4 in 47 cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers Terni 40 mm 39 guns in single mounts and eight 13.2 mm 0.52 in guns in twin mounts. The 100 mm guns were copies of Austro Hungarian guns designed in 1910 by Skoda that were placed in newly designed dual purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of 15,240 m 50,000 ft . The ships' secondary battery was revised several times during their careers. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 37 mm 1.5 in 54 cal. guns were installed in their place. Two 120 mm 4.7 in 15 cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. In 1942, the star shell guns aboard Gorizia, by this time the only surviving member of the class, were replaced with four more 37 mm guns. The following year, a battery of fourteen 20 mm 0.79 in guns in six twin and two single mounts replaced the 13.2 mm 0.52 in machine guns. The ships were protected with an armored citadel that covered the ships' vitals, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. Vertical protection consisted of an armored belt that was 150 mm 5.9 in thick at the waterline and reduced to 100 mm 3.9 in at the bottom edge of the belt. Their main armor deck was 70 mm 2.8 in thick, and the box formed by the belt and deck was capped at either end by armored bulkheads that were 120 mm 4.7 in thick in the upper portion and 90 mm 3.5 in in the lower section. The main deck was supplemented with an upper deck that was 20 mm 0.79 in thick, which was intended to detonate the fuses of incoming shells before they struck the main deck the upper deck was connected to an upper belt that was 30 mm 1.2 in thick. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides and an 80 mm 3.1 in thick roof. The Zara class carried three times the armor protection of the preceding Trentos. Their heavy armor made the Zaras the best protected cruisers until the introduction of the Des Moines class, laid down in 1945 by the United States. This additional armor would have made the ships decidedly nose heavy, so to offset this the rear of the ship was raised by one deck behind the front funnel. The result was excellent watertight integrity and protection. After entering service in the early 1930s, the four members of the Zara class took part in training exercises with the Italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklos Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Gorizia and Pola were involved in the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Pola conducted non intervention patrols and Gorizia carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon sur Mer, France that year. After departing France, Gorizia visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank that forced her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty's displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them to stop in Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, Zara, Pola, and Gorizia provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania. The Zara class cruisers saw extensive service during World War II, having taken part in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the 1st Division. At the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier HMS Eagle attacked the Zara class cruisers, but they failed to score any hits. The ships steamed ahead to the front of the Italian line of battle and joined the attack on the leading British battleship, Warspite, but they scored no hits. British cruisers attacked as the Italians withdrew, but heavy fire from the Italian cruisers drove them off. All four ships escaped damage at the Battle of Taranto in November 1940. In March 1941 at the Battle of Cape Matapan, Pola was immobilized by a torpedo from a Swordfish torpedo bomber launched by the British aircraft carrier HMS Formidable Zara and Fiume were detached from the rest of the fleet to protect Pola, and all three and a pair of destroyers were sunk in a close range night engagement with the battleships Barham, Valiant, and Warspite. Italian casualties were very heavy, with 783 killed aboard Zara, 328 killed aboard Pola, 812 aboard Fiume. The survivors, mostly from Pola, were rescued primarily by British destroyers, though Greek destroyers and an Italian hospital ship picked up others over the following few days. Gorizia, the sole surviving member of the class, saw action at the First Battle of Sirte in December 1941 and Second Sirte in March 1942, where she was heavily engaged with British light cruisers and destroyers. As the action took place at very long range, neither side scored any hits. During this period, the ship also took part in convoy escort operations to supply Italian and German forces in North Africa. While the ship was moored in La Maddalena on 10 April 1943, a major attack from United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers sank the heavy cruiser Trieste and hit Gorizia with three bombs, inflicting serious damage. She was still under repair in La Spezia when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, and she was seized by German forces when they occupied much of the country. On 22 June 1944, Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedoes to enter the harbor and sink Gorizia and the heavy cruiser Bolzano, which was also out of service due to battle damage, to prevent them from being used as blockships though Gorizia survived the attack. She was nevertheless sold for scrap in 1947, since it would have been cost prohibitive to repair her.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara-class%20cruiser
"The Zara class was a class of three torpedo cruisers built for the Austro Hungarian Navy in the late 1870s and early 1880s they were the first large torpedo armed warships built by Austria Hungary. The class comprised three ships, Zara, Spalato, and Sebenico the last vessel was built to a slightly different design, and is sometimes not counted as a member of the class. The design was prepared by Josef von Romako, the Chief Constructor of the Austro Hungarian Navy, after a lengthy design process throughout the 1870s. The first two ships were armed with deck mounted torpedo tubes, while Sebenico received an experimental tube in her bow, submerged below the waterline. Despite the lengthy design process, the ships proved to be failures in service, primarily as a result of their low speed. Intended to reach a speed of at least 15 knots 28 km h 17 mph , none of the vessels were able to steam that fast. The changes made to Sebenico during construction were meant to address the problem, but she was unable to reach her design speed either. As a result, they saw very little active service, spending much of their careers in reserve. By the 1890s, they were reactivated for training ship duties, and in 1897 Sebenico took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete, where she sank a Greek blockade runner. Training ship duties continued through the early 1910s. During World War I, all three vessels were used as guard ships, but none saw action. After the war, they were seized as war prizes by the Allies and awarded to Italy in 1920 all were broken up immediately thereafter. Through the 1870s, the Marinekommandant Navy Commander of the Austro Hungarian Navy, Friedrich von Pock, could not secure sufficient funding for construction of ironclad warships. Unable to increase the strength of the ironclad fleet, Pock turned to less expensive means to defend Austria Hungary's coastline, including development of naval mines and self propelled torpedoes. In March 1872, the Torpedoversuchs Kommission Torpedo Testing Commission recommended to Pock that a new warship should be built to use the Whitehead torpedo that had been developed in Austria Hungary in the 1860s. Pock decided to await a report from then Fregattenkapitan Frigate Captain Hermann von Spaun, the naval attache to Britain, who was observing British developments, including the construction of the torpedo gunboat HMS Vesuvius. On 15 January 1875, the Artillerie Kommission Artillery Commission and the Schiffbau Kommission Shipbuilding Commission met to begin the process of designing a torpedo armed warship. In the meantime, Pock ordered the first torpedo boat, Torpedoboot I, from Britain that year, followed by five more from Britain and four more from domestic shipyards thereafter. The commissions were primarily concerned with several fundamental concerns, including whether the ship should be armored or not, whether it would only use the Whitehead torpedoes or it would also carry towed torpedoes, the propulsion system and whether it would include a sailing rig or not, and the speed the ship should be capable of reaching. The Schiffbau Kommission recommended building a ship with heavy armor to protect it from enemy fire, one or two 10 centimeter 3.9 in guns in the bow, deck mounted launchers for the Whitehead torpedoes, and towed torpedoes to be used defensively against ramming. The launchers would be supplied with six torpedoes each. The ship would be capable of a speed of at least 15 knots 28 km h 17 mph from a twin screw propulsion system, and it would not be equipped with a sailing rig. They also created an alternate proposal for a smaller, unarmored ship with just two to four light guns, in the event that their preferred vessel could not reach the desired speed. The Artillerie Kommission proposed a smaller design with sufficient armor and a high speed but no guns. They argued that an attempt to build what they described as a universal battle ship i.e., the Schiffbau Kommission's first proposal was ill advised, since torpedoes were still in the developmental phase and a vessel of that type would be expensive and risky, considering the limited budgets of the time. The Torpedoversuchs Kommission recommended a vessel with submerged torpedo tubes, a ram bow, deck and waterline belt armor, and two heavy gun turrets if it were possible to install them without compromising the ability of the ship to use its torpedoes effectively. Alternatively, if submerged tubes could not be made to work on the broad side, the ship should include two deck mounted launchers with at least five torpedoes apiece, four heavy guns, and a speed sufficient just to keep pace with the ironclads of the main fleet. On 26 March, Pock held a meeting to discuss the proposals. A suggestion was made to await developments in torpedo technology and to incorporate the weapons into the next ironclad that they could secure funding from Parliament to build. Josef von Romako, the Chief Constructor of the Austro Hungarian Navy, pointed out that such a vessel would have to be very large to allow it to reach high enough speeds for it to be able to use torpedoes effectively. The meeting concluded with the consensus that the new vessel should be built as a purely torpedo armed vessel, with no armor and no heavy guns. In the meantime, Spaun made his report on British naval activities, which included the completion of Vesuvius and the introduction of twin screw propulsion. He also reported on the construction and sea trials of the British built torpedo aviso SMS Zieten for the Imperial German Navy. Zieten proved to be fast and maneuverable, qualities that made her well suited to training and development of the German torpedo warfare arm. In January 1877, Pock decided that the new vessel should incorporate the twin screw, 15 knot requirement from the Schiffbau Kommission proposal. On 30 January, Shipbuilding Engineer Andressen began working on the projet, which at that time included a pair of 24 cm 9.4 in guns in an armored casemate. Pock pointed out that the ship should not include heavy guns, and that two 12 cm 4.7 in guns without armor would be sufficient the only armor the ship was to have was a curved protective deck. Andressen prepared three more designs, as seen in the table below. Pock rejected all of Andressen's proposals, since none of them incorporated the characteristics specified in the March 1875 meeting. Romako took over the design process in 1878, and prepared the design for Zara, construction of which began on 1 August that year. Romako based his design on the German Zieten, though the German vessel was significantly faster than the Zara class, in part owing to the fact that Zieten had a longer, finer hull and was more lightly built. In addition, the engines and boilers used in Zara and her sister ships could not tolerate as high a pressure as those in Zieten, and their boilers consumed coal excessively. The first two ships of the Zara classZara and Spalatowere 62.71 meters 205 ft 9 in long overall and 55 m 180 ft long between perpendiculars. They had a beam of 8.22 m 27 ft 0 in and a draft of 4.1 m 13 ft 5 in . Sebenico was built to a slightly larger design in an attempt to rectify the earlier vessels' inability to meet the designed speed. She was 64.91 m 213 ft 0 in overall and 57.2 m 188 ft between perpendiculars, with a beam of 8.24 m 27 ft 0 in and a draft of 4.2 m 13 ft 9 in . Zara and Spalato displaced 833 long tons 846 t , while Sebenico was slightly heavier, at 882.6 long tons 896.8 t . Each ship had a crew of 13 officers and 135 enlisted men. The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of two cylinder vertical compound steam engines, with steam provided by five coal fired, cylindrical fire tube boilers. The boilers were ducted into a single funnel located amidships. The engines drove a pair of bronze screws that were 2.74 m 9 ft 0 in in diameter. On trials, Zara reached a speed of 14.29 knots 26.47 km h 16.44 mph from 1,800 metric horsepower 1,800 ihp , by far the fastest member of the class, though still below her design speed. Spalato reached a speed of 12.63 knots 23.39 km h 14.53 mph from 1,370 PS 1,350 ihp , while Sebenico made 12.81 knots 23.72 km h 14.74 mph from 1,598 PS 1,576 ihp . To supplement their steam engines, each vessel had an auxiliary sailing barquentine rig with two masts and a sail area of 275.6 m2 2,967 sq ft . The ships' gun armament consisted of four 9 centimeter 3.5 in 24 caliber cal. guns in single mounts, along with one 7 cm 2.8 in 15 cal. gun and two 25 mm 0.98 in Nordenfelt guns. Zara and Spalato were also armed with four torpedo tubes. The torpedo tubes were located singly, two in the bow and at either beam in deck mounted launchers. Sebenico instead had a single bow mounted torpedo tube in her bow, submerged below the waterline. All three Zara class ships were protected with a thin 19 mm 0.75 in armored deck. The ships were modified extensively in an attempt to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re boilered. All three ships received several 47 mm 1.9 in guns in the mid 1880s these included a Hotchkiss revolver cannon on their bows and four single barrel quick firing guns. In 1897, Spalato received a wide variety of guns so she could be used with the artillery training school. These included one 12 cm 4.7 in 40 cal. gun, two 15 cm 5.9 in 26 cal. guns, one 47 mm 44 cal. gun, and two 37 mm 1.5 in guns two of the 9 cm guns were removed to make room. By 1901, man of these guns had been removed, leaving just two 12 cm guns, one 6.6 cm 2.6 in gun, two 47 mm 44 cal. guns, and one 37 mm gun. Sebenico was similarly modified in 1903 in addition to two 12 cm guns, she acquired one 6.6 cm gun, four 47 mm 33 cal. guns, four 47 mm 44 cal. guns, two 37 mm 23 cal. guns, two 37 mm autocannon, and two 8 mm 0.31 in machine guns. At some point before 1914, she also received a 10 cm 3.9 in gun. In 1917, Zara's armament consisted of two 6.6 cm guns, four 47 mm 33 cal. guns and four 47 mm 44 cal. guns, along with her two bow torpedo tubes. Owing to their poor performance and slow speed, the Zara class cruisers did not see significant service with the fleet. They were too slow to be used as fleet scouts or flotilla leaders, and their gun armament was too weak for them to be able to protect torpedo boats from torpedo boat destroyers. As a result, they spent most of the 1880s and 1890s laid up, being reactivated briefly for training exercises. Sebenico returned to active service in 1893, alternating between sea duty with the training squadron and harbor service as a training ship for engine room personnel. In 1897, Spalato became assigned to the artillery school, while Zara was recommissioned for use in the torpedo school. That year, Sebenico took part in the only significant period of fleet service, when she was sent to the island of Crete to participate in an international naval demonstration during Greco Turkish War. During the blockade, Sebenico stopped and sank a Greek vessel trying to break the blockade. Sebenico served in a variety of auxiliary roles over the following five years, before joining Spalato in the artillery school in 1903 the three ships served in their training roles until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, at which point they became guard ships. The ships saw no action during the war, owing in large part to the nature of the Adriatic campaign. The Austro Hungarian Navy and its primary opponent, the Italian Navy, both adopted cautious strategies, since neither wanted to risk its fleet in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea, where naval mines and fast, torpedo armed craft could operate effectively. Zara was stationed in Cattaro Bay and Sebenico protected the harbor of her namesake city, while Spalato provided local defense outside Pola. Zara was transferred from Cattaro Bay to Pola in June 1917, but while en route, suffered a serious explosion that caused significant damage to her bow. A contemporary investigation determined that it was the result of badly deteriorated chemicals in her torpedo warheads, though the naval historian Rene Greger reports that a mine was actually to blame. After repairs were effected, she joined the harbor defense at Pola. Sebenico was withdrawn from guard duties in 1918 and assigned to the torpedo school. All three ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers after the war in 1918, and all three were awarded to Italy in 1920. Having no use for the vessels, the Italians immediately sold all three to ship breakers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara-class%20cruiser%20%281879%29
"Asif Ali Zardari Urdu Sindhi born 26 July 1955 is a Pakistani politician and the former co chairperson of Pakistan People's Party. He served as the 11th President of Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, the first president born after Partition. He is member of National Assembly of Pakistan since August 2018. The son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a landowner from Sindh, Zardari rose to prominence after his marriage to Benazir Bhutto in 1987, who became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after her election in 1988. When Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990, Zardari was widely criticized for involvement in corruption scandals that led to its collapse. When Bhutto was reelected in 1993, Zardari served as Federal Investment Minister and Chairperson of Pakistan Environmental Protection Council. Following increasing tensions between Bhutto's brother Murtaza and Zardari, Murtaza was killed in a police encounter in Karachi on 20 September 1996. Bhutto's government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari, while Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder as well as corruption charges. Although incarcerated, he nominally served in Parliament after being elected to the National Assembly in 1990 and Senate in 1997. He was released from jail in 2004 and went into self exile to Dubai, but returned when Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007. As the new Co Chairman of the PPP, he led his party to victory in the 2008 general elections. He spearheaded a coalition that forced military ruler Pervez Musharraf to resign, and was elected President on 6 September 2008. He was acquitted of various criminal charges the same year. As president, Zardari remained a strong American ally in the war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the Nato attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012, after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan. Towards the end of his term, Zardari recorded abysmally low approval ratings, ranging from 11 to 14 . After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country's first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 9 September 2013. His legacy remains divisive, with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and cronyism. Zardari was born on 26 July 1955 in Karachi, Sindh in the Zardari family. He is of Baloch origin, belonging to a Jat clan of the Sindhi Baloch Zardari tribe. He is the only son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a tribal chief and prominent landowner, and Bilquis Sultana Zardari. He is also of partial Iraqi descent on his paternal side. In his youth, he enjoyed polo and boxing. He led a polo team known as the Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino a famous cinema in Karachiand donated movie equipment to his school. He also appeared in a movie, Salgirah, as a child artist. Zardari's academic background remains a question mark. He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 197374 a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a bachelor of education degree in the early 1970s. Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree, but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008. Zardari's initial political career was unsuccessful. In 1983, he lost an election for a district council seat in Nawabshah, a city of Sindh, where his family owned thousands of acres of farmland. He then went into real estate. He married Benazir Bhutto on 18 December 1987. The arranged marriage, done in accordance with Pakistani culture, was initially considered an unlikely match. The lavish sunset ceremony in Karachi was followed by immense night celebrations that included over 100,000 people. The marriage enhanced Bhutto's political position in a country where older unmarried women are frowned upon. Zardari deferred to his wife's wishes by agreeing to stay out of politics. In 1988, General Muhammad Zia ul Haq died in a plane crash. A few months later, Bhutto became Pakistan's first female Prime Minister when her party won 94 of 207 seats contested in the 1988 elections. He generally stayed out of his wife's first administration, but he and his associates became entangled in corruption cases linked to the government. He was largely blamed for the collapse of the Bhutto administration. After the dismissal of Bhutto's government in August 1990, Benazir Bhutto and Zardari were prohibited from leaving the country by security forces under the direction of the Pakistan Army. During the interim government between August and October, caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a Bhutto rival, initiated investigations of corruption by the Bhutto administration. Jatoi accused Zardari of using his wife's political position to charge a ten percent commission for obtaining permission to set up any project or to receive loans. He was tagged with the nickname Mr. Ten Percent . He was arrested on 10 October 1990 on charges relating to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, he was elected to the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted 20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts. On March 25, 1991, the hijackers aboard Singapore Airlines Flight 117 demanded Zardari's release among other demands. The hijackers were killed by Singapore Commandos. In April 1993, he became one of the 18 cabinet ministers in the caretaker government that succeeded Nawaz Sharif's first abridged premiership. The caretaker government lasted until the July elections. After Bhutto's election, he served as her Investment Minister, chief of the intelligence bureau, and the head of the Federal Investigation Agency. In February 1994, Benazir sent Zardari to meet with Saddam Hussein in Iraq to deliver medicine in exchange for three detained Pakistanis arrested on the ambiguous Kuwait Iraq border. In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as de facto Prime Minister . In March 1995, he was appointed chairman of the new Environment Protection Council. During the beginning of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three year civil war. At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible and vowed to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement. Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother in law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP. In November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by Leghari primarily because of corruption and Murtaza's death. Zardari was arrested in Lahore while attempting to flee the country to Dubai. A major report was published in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed 200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a 4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of 5 million each by a gold bullion dealer in return for a monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than 1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid 1990s spending spree, which included hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings. Citibank, already under fire for its private banking practices, got into further trouble as a result of the report. Zardari's financial history was one case study in a 1999 U.S. Senate report on vulnerabilities in banking procedures. In March 1997, Zardari was elected to the Senate while in a Karachi jail. In December 1997, he was flown to Islamabad under tight security to take his oath. In July 1998, he was indicted for corruption in Pakistan after the Swiss government handed over documents to Pakistani authorities relating to money laundering. The Swiss had also indicted him for money laundering. At the same time, in a separate case, he and 18 others were indicted for conspiracy to murder Murtaza Bhutto. After criminal prosecutions began, Citibank closed Zardari's account. In April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari were convicted for receiving indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection company that was hired to end corruption in the collection of customs duties. The couple received a fine of 8.6 million. Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self imposed exile. Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges. The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability. In May 1999, he was hospitalised after an alleged attempted suicide. He claimed it was a murder attempt by the police. In August 2003, a Swiss judge convicted Bhutto and Zardari of money laundering and sentenced them to six months imprisonment and a fine of 50,000. In addition, they were required to return 11 million to the Pakistani government. The conviction involved charges relating to kickbacks from two Swiss firms in exchange for customs fraud. In France, Poland, and Switzerland, the couple faced additional allegations. In November 2004, he was released on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing to show up for a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he was released on 5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release again was regarded as a sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf's government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai. He returned to Lahore in April 2005. Police prevented him from holding rallies by escorting him from the airport to his home. He criticised Musharraf's government, but rumours of reconciliation between Musharraf and the PPP grew. Zardari went back to Dubai in May 2005. In June 2005, he suffered a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States. In September 2005, he did not show up for a Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges the court issued an arrest warrant. His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition. When Bhutto announced in September 2007 her upcoming return to Pakistan, her husband was in New York City undergoing medical treatment. After the October 2007 bombing in Karachi that tainted Bhutto's return, he accused Pakistani intelligence services of being behind the attacks and claimed it was not done by militants . He had not accompanied Bhutto, staying in Dubai with their daughters. Bhutto called for the removal of the chief investigator of the attacks because she claimed he had been involved in Zardari's alleged torture in prison in 1999. In November 2007, Musharraf instituted emergency rule for six weeks see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007 , under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, a few days after Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S. backed proposalthe National Reconciliation Ordinance NRO to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters. In the midst of his exile, Zardari had several different legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about 2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil for food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, he would have had to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen 60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil for food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial. In exile, he shifted between homes in New York, London, and Dubai, where his three children lived. On the night of 27 December 2007, he returned to Pakistan following his wife's assassination. Zardari prevented Bhutto's autopsy in accordance with Islamic principles. He and their children attended her funeral, which was held the next day. He denied government allegations that the assassination was sponsored by Al Qaida. He called for an international inquiry into her death and stated that she would still be alive if Musharraf's government had provided adequate protection. He and his family offered to accept Musharraf's demand to exhume Bhutto's body in exchange for a United Nations inquiry, but Musharraf rejected the proposal. In Bhutto's political will, she had designated Zardari her successor as party leader. However, their nineteen year old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, became Chairman of the PPP because Zardari favoured Bilawal to represent Bhutto's legacy, in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity. He did, however, serve as Co Chairman of the PPP for at least three years until Bilawal completed his studies overseas. Zardari called for no delays to the 8 January parliamentary elections and for the participation of all opposition parties. Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott. Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February. In January 2008, he suggested that if his party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League Q PML Q . He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League N party PML N , threatened national protests if any vote rigging was attempted. He himself could not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive. The PPP and the PML N won the largest and second largest number of seats respectively in the February elections. He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power sharing deal between him and Musharraf. They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, he reached out to Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections. After weeks of speculation and party infighting, he said he did not want to become Prime Minister. In mid March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the more politically powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim. He and Sharif agreed in a 9 March 2008 agreement, known as the Murree Declaration, to the reinstatement by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf. The deadline was later extended to 12 May. He and Sharif held unsuccessful talks at London in May. After the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, the PML N withdrew from the government in mid May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet. The coalition regrouped, again with the PML N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove the power of the President to dismiss Parliament. By late May, the coalition was set in a confrontation with Musharraf. At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth. He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 to discuss Musharraf's removal and the constitutional amendments, which the PML N viewed as not going far enough to fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition did not have the two thirds majority in both legislative bodiesNational Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years. In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the coalition agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and the coalition selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned in order to avoid impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance on the future of the judiciary. Presidential elections were held within three weeks after the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement MQM for the presidency. The PML N nominated former justice Saeed uz Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected President on 6 September 2008. At the inauguration on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was a guest of honour, which was a signal for much closer cooperation between the two nations in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President. From 23 to 26 September 2008, he met with various foreign leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao. He suffered political embarrassment by flirting with U.S. Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin and making tongue in cheek comments about her. Although, at the United Nations General Assembly, he publicly condemned U.S drone attacks in Pakistan, the Washington Post reported that he had signed a secret deal when he met with senior American officials that arranged for the coordination of Predator strikes and a jointly approved list of prominent targets. He and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to resume peace talks by the end of 2008. From 14 to 17 October 2008, he was in China to negotiate foreign aid, as Pakistan faced the possibility of defaulting on its payments. China refused to offer any aid commitments, but instead promised to provide assistance in the development of two nuclear power plants and more future business investments. After Saudi Arabia, Britain, China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates refused to provide any bailout, he officially asked the International Monetary Fund IMF for assistance in solving Pakistan's balance of payments problem on 22 October. He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November in hopes of obtaining financial aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies as part of a broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance. In mid November 2008, Zardari's government officially sent a letter of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a 11.3 billion multi year loan package, Pakistan received a 7.4 billion loan for 200810. The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined 3 billion aid in the 201011 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package. In January 2011, the MQM withdrew from the government. Zardari's ruling coalition averted a government collapse by accepting the opposition's economic proposals, which restored gas subsidies and abandoned many of the IMF's suggested reforms. In an effort to curb government expenditures, Zardari swore in an austerity cabinet in February 2011 which reduced the cabinet from 60 ministers to 22. In early October 2008, he received fierce domestic criticism for repeatedly calling Kashmiri nationalists see Kashmir conflict in India terrorists . In mid November 2008, he suggested Pakistan was ready for a no first use nuclear policy and called for closer economic ties. The relationship between the two nations was damaged by the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He initially denied any links between the perpetrators and Pakistan, but the government soon pursued military action against Lashkar e Taiba leaders in a 7 December raid. India cleared Zardari's government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them. Zardari offered to send Inter Services Intelligence Director General Ahmed Shuja Pasha to assist in the investigation. In June 2009, Zardari met Singh for the first time since the Mumbai attacks at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia. On 8 April 2012, President Zardari, along with his son Bilawal Zardari Bhutto, visited Dargah Sharif in Ajmer, India on a private visit. He also met with the Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh. The government has had a longstanding conflict in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KP , Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan. Diplomatic relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai improved after Musharraf's departure and Zardari's rise to power. The Obama administration's AfPak policy, through AfPak envoy Richard Holbrooke, reflected the unified approach the United States took in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan. In his first visit to Afghanistan as President in early January 2009, Zardari promised a renewed relationship to improve cooperation. In late March, Obama announced a civilian aid package of 7.5 billion over five years in return for cooperation in the AfPak conflict. In late April, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Zardari and promised 1 billion over the next four years. In May, Obama held a trilateral summit in Washington D.C with Karzai and Zardari, where they discussed further cooperation. At Brussels in mid June, Zardari unsuccessfully sought trade concessions from the European Union it instead pledged 90 million development aid to curtail tribal influence by insurgents. After the U.S. Congress passed Obama's civilian aid package in October, army generals in the Pakistani military establishment widened the growing rift with Zardari's government and openly criticised U.S. interference. In February 2009, FATA's provincial government officially declared Islamic law in Swat to achieve a ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district. In September 2010, Zardari and Karzai met in Islamabad and both advocated fighting insurgents rather than trying to end the war with diplomacy. Zardari went to the United States in January 2011 to attend Special Envoy Holbrooke's funeral. Following Osama bin Laden's death in a compound in Abbottabad in May 2011, Obama called Zardari and collaborated on the events. In February 2009, Zardari and the Musharraf appointed Supreme Court attempted to disqualify Nawaz Sharif from running in any elections and tried to force his brother Shahbaz Sharif to resign as Chief Minister of Punjab province. Zardari dismissed the Punjab provincial government and only partially reinstated the judiciary by restoring 56 other judges deposed by Musharrafbut not their former leader, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. After Nawaz Sharif defied house arrest and rallied with thousands of his supporters, the Sharif brothers vowed to join forces with the Lawyers' Movement in the Long March . Zardari's government gave in to popular pressure and Prime Minister Gilani in an early morning speech on 16 March 2009 promised to reinstate Chaudhry by 21 March. Ten judges were reinstated on 16 March, and Chaudry assumed his position on 22 March. Zardari's month long direct control of the Punjab ended on 30 March. In April 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari signed the Nizam e Adl Regulation into law. The regulation formally established Sharia law in the Malakand division. In late November 2009, Zardari ceded to Prime Minister Gillani the chairmanship of the National Command Authority, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal oversight agency. In December 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which cleared the way for the revival of corruption cases against Zardari. Although Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan e Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order. In February 2010, Zardari sparked a standoff by attempting to appoint a Supreme Court candidate without the court's approval, but the confrontation ended after he backed down and nominated a candidate acceptable by the court. In April 2010, after months of political pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the office of the power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament. In late September 2010, the Supreme Court considered removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry met with his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening the power of the Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments. In March 2011, Zardari delivered his annual parliamentary address to a half empty chamber because of an opposition walkout. In November 2012, the Pakistan government in response to the court orders, finally wrote to the Swiss authorities seeking to reopen the corruption cases against Zardari. The Swiss government responded by saying that the corruption cases being time barred cannot be reopened. The 2010 Pakistan floods began in late July with rain in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and soon submerged a fifth of Pakistan and afflicted 20 million people, resulting in one of the nation's largest natural catastrophes. Simultaneously, British Prime Minister David Cameron sparked a serious diplomatic row with Pakistan during his visit to India by stating that elements within Pakistan were promoting the export of terror a week before a planned visit by Zardari to Britain. Zardari ignored domestic pressure and began his European trip in Paris on 1 August, meeting French President Sarkozy. In France, he drew a rebuke from the U.S. after stating that NATO had lost the battle for hearts and minds in the Afghan war. As the flood's devastation became increasingly evident, he was widely criticised for flying in a helicopter to his Normandy chateau and dining at Cameron's Chequers countryside home. Protests within Britain, mainly among the British Pakistani community, grew against his visit. The widely expected maiden speech by his son Bilawal was cancelled, as Zardari faced criticism for using the trip to advance Bilawal's political aspirations. Zardari returned to Pakistan on 10 August. He first visit to an area affected by the flooding was in Sukkur on 12 August. He cancelled the 14 August Independence Day celebrations and instead visited Naushera. He flew over devastated areas with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki moon on 15 August. He left the country on 18 August and attended the four way Russian summit at Sochi, which included Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On 19 August, he visited Jampur with U.S. Senator John Kerry. He ordered local authorities to concentrate efforts to save Shahdadkot from inundation on 24 August. In early December 2011 Zardari flew to Dubai undergoing medical tests and treatment, reportedly for a small stroke . According to the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, Zardari sought medical treatment outside of Pakistan because of threats to his life . He finds himself currently in the midst of the Memogate controversy. Zardari left the hospital on 14 December to recuperate at the Persian Gulf, while his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, assumed a more prominent role in Pakistan. By 19 December, Zardari had returned to Pakistan. Pakistan and China on 22 May 2013 inked several Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding MoUs that mainly included the long term Economic Corridor plan, maritime cooperation and satellite navigation. President Asif Ali Zardari and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang witnessed the signing ceremony as the representatives of the two countries inked the documents at a ceremony held at the Aiwan e Sadr. The visit of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang marked the signing of important documents aimed at long term cooperation between the two countries in multiple areas. Zardari completed his five year term on 8 September 2013, becoming the first democratically elected President in the 66 year long history of Pakistan to complete his tenure. He received a guard of honour while leaving the Aiwan e Sadr. He was succeeded by Mamnoon Hussain as President. He became active in the PPP, which he voted to revamp, after his presidency. He succeeded Ameen Faheem as chairman of PPPP in 2015. In December 2016, he announced that both he and his son Bilawal, would contest the 2018 general election. In July, 2017, During investigation of Panama Papers case, Zardari demanded Nawaz Sharif's resignation. In August 2017, Pakistan's anti corruption acquitted him from his last pending case in which he was accused along with his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, of laundering illegal kickbacks and maintaining assets beyond known sources of income. The case had dogged him for 19 years. His rival Imran Khan believed that Zardari's acquittal was the result of a deal between PML N and PPP. However he denied any kind of collaboration. The National Accountability Bureau also challenged the acquittal. In 2 September, after his wife's murder case verdict which declared Pervez Musharraf as fugitive and convicted two senior police officer, he said that he was not satisfied with the verdict and that he will appeal the judgment as it had acquitted five Pakistani Taliban suspects. Zardari and Benazir Bhutto had one son and two daughters. His son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, is the current Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. His older daughter, Bakhtawar, was born on 25 January 1990, and his younger daughter, Aseefa, was born on 2 February 1993. After Benazir Bhutto's death, his sister Faryal Talpur became the guardian of his children and he changed Bilawal Zardari's name to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. In January 2011, Pakistani news media, including the nation's largest Urdu newspaper from the Jang Group , reported that Zardari had married Tanveer Zamani. Zardari's spokesperson, Farhatullah Babar, accused Zamani for deliberately aiding to the hoax. In 2015, ZardariZamani marriage was again in the news due recent allegations in the interviews by Tanvir Zamani. Allegedly, they have a son named, Sajawal Bhutto. His mother died in November 2002, during his detention in jail. His father Hakim Ali Zardari died in May 2011. After that he became the chieftain of the Zardari tribe. However, initially he had decided not to assume leadership and wanted to pass the position to his son Bilawal. His mental health has been a subject of controversy. He has repeatedly claimed he was tortured while in prison. He was diagnosed with dementia, major depressive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder from 2005 to 2007, which helped influence the verdict of one of his corruption trials. He now claims he is completely healthy, with only high blood pressure and diabetes. Zardari is said to have a belief in occult and superstitions. According to a report by the Dawn newspaper, a black goat is slaughtered almost daily to ward off the 'evil eye' and protect President Zardari from 'black magic.' It has been an old practice of Zardari to offer Sadaqah charity of animal sacrifice and distribute meat to the poor. He has been doing this for a long time, the newspaper quoted the Pakistan president's spokesman Farhatullah Babar as saying. In 2005, Daily Pakistan reported he was the second richest man in Pakistan with an estimated net worth of 1.8 billion. He amassed great wealth while his wife was Prime Minister. In 2007, he received 60 million in his Swiss bank account through offshore companies under his name. He was reported to have estates in Surrey, West End of London, Normandy, Manhattan a condominium in Belaire Apartments , and Dubai, as well as a 16th century chateau in Normandy. In Britain, he used a common legal devicethe purchase of property through nominees with no family link to the Bhuttos. His homes in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad are called Bilawal House I, Bilawal House II, and Zardari House respectively. He bought a 365 acre 148 hectare 20 bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through a chain of firms, trusts, and offshore companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly before the end of his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. As of November 2008 , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues. The estate includes two farms, lodgings, staff accommodation, and a basement made into an imitation of a local pub. The manor has nine bedrooms and an indoor swimming pool. He had sent large shipments from Karachi in the 1990s for the refurbishment of Surrey Palace. He has faced allegations from various people, including the daughter of Laila Shahzada, that he acquired stolen art to decorate the palace. He earlier had plans for a helipad, a nine hole golf course, and a polo pony paddock.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif%20Ali%20Zardari
"The Zarqa River Arabic , Nahr az Zarqa, lit. the River of the Blue is the second largest tributary of the lower Jordan River, after the Yarmouk River. It is the third largest river in the region by annual discharge, and its watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River. It rises in springs near Amman, and flows through a deep and broad valley into the Jordan, at an elevation 1,090 metres 3,580 ft lower. At its spring lays 'Ain Ghazal Arabic , a major archaeological site that dates back to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river indicate the area was rich in flora and fauna in the past. The river is heavily polluted and its restoration is one of the top priorities for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment. Geologically, the Zarqa River is about 30 million years old. It is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous 135 m.y. . A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition Kaddumi, 2005 2007 . The Arabic name, Nahr az Zarqa' means the blue river , where nahr means river and zarqa' means blue. The name is of Akkadian origin Zar Ka which mean the Place of Water Zar being Water and Ka being Place or Area , hence at the Dead Sea is the Zara springs Zara, Water and also in the heart of Amman an area locally called Wadi Sakra which comes from Wadi Zara which means the Valley of Water. The Zarqa River is identified with the biblical river Jabbok . Biblical Jacob crossed the Jabbok on his way to Canaan, after leaving Harran. It leads west into the Sukkot Valley, from where one crosses over the Jordan and can easily reach Shechem, as Jacob eventually did. The biblical cities of Zaretan and Adam are also at the mouth of the valley. The river is first mentioned in the Book of Genesis in connection with the meeting of Jacob and Esau, and with the struggle of Jacob with the angel. It was the boundary separating the territory of Reuben and Gad from that of Ammon, the latter being described as lying along the Jabbok. The territory of Sihon is described as extending from Arnon unto Jabbok Numbers 21 24 , and it was reclaimed later by the King of Ammon. Eusebius places the river between Gerasa and Philadelphia. The headwaters of the Zarqa begin just northeast of Amman, rising from a spring named Ain Ghazal Gazelle spring . The river flows to the north before heading west. Rising on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead, it runs a course of about 105 kilometers 65 mi in a wild and deep ravine before flowing into the Jordan River between Gennesaret and the Dead Sea, at a point 1,090 meters 3,576 ft below its origin. At its higher reaches, the river banks are mostly steep and canyon like. Near Ain Ghazal, two tributary wadis join the river, and it opens up into a shallow basin. It forms the border between the Jordanian administrative regions of Irbid and Balqa Governorate. The river is perennial, but with a very low base flow of about 2 million to 3 million cubic meters per month during the summer months, and as much as 5million to 8 million cubic meters per month during the rainy winter months. This makes it the second largest tributary of the lower Jordan River, after the Yarmouk River, and the third largest river in the region by annual discharge. Irregular floods after rain storms may increase the flow to as much as 54 million cubic meters. The median annual flow is 63.3 million cubic meters. The total basin area is 3,900 km2 1,500 sq mi the largest in Jordan. A small dam, Al Rwyha dam, near the village of Dayr Alla, marks the end of the upstream portion of the river, where it is natural and fast flowing with very clear water. There is very little agriculture along the banks of the river in this region, which are very rocky. Downstream from this dam, the water level is very low, and the river banks are intensively used for agriculture, as well as grazing by sheep and goats The King Talal Dam was built across the lower Zarqa in 1970, and created a reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters, and increased in 1987 to 86 million cubic meters. When built, it was expected that the reservoir would supply water for municipal use in the Amman region. However, the current levels of pollution in the lake make the water unfit for human consumption, and it is used for irrigation only. The new Jerash Bridge crosses the Zarqa upstream of King Talal reservoir, on the road from Amman to Jerash. The bridge is the site of a gauging station where flow measurements are continuously taken. In the city of Zarqa, several bridges, vehicular and pedestrian, cross the river. The earliest of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city. Current bridges include the Zawahreh Bridge, a vehicular bridge connecting Baha' al Din Street with al Zuhur Street and another connecting Baha' al Din Street with King Talal Street. Two pedestrian bridges connect al Zuhur Street and Baha' al Din Street, and Wasfi al Tal Street and Petra Street. The geological origins of the Zarqa river are about 30 million years old, when the Jordan Rift Valley was formed. A ripple effect of its formation was the creation of side wadis. The Zarqa river carved into the western edge of one of these side wadis. The earliest exposed formations in the area date from the Triassic and early Jurassic periods, and have been named Zerqa and Kurnub formations. The rock formations are marine sediments, remnants of the prehistoric Tethys Sea, which used to cover the area running roughly eastwest, halfway across the present Dead Sea. Along the Zarqa, crystalline limestone alternating with shale was found. The next layer is a 20 30 meter high layer of gypsum, argillaceous marly lime, shales and iron rich stone and sandstone. This layer is rich in fossils. Archaeological finds of charcoaled remains indicate that poplar and tamarix used to grow along the banks of the Zarqa, with forests of wild oak growing on the hillsides. Today, tamarix thickets are still widespread in the floodplains, and the banks are cultivated with fruit orchards and vegetable fields. Along the course of Zarqa River, water is pumped directly and used to irrigate crops of leafy vegetables such as parsley, spinach, cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce, as well as potatoes. Olive trees are also found along the river's banks. Tulips grow on many hillsides of the river, while in the springs area and the watercourse, water vegetation is found. Natural pine forests grow in the King Talal Dam area. Along the upstream banks, where the river runs wild, one finds the common reed, oleander and Typha species. Since the waters of the Zarqa are highly contaminated, with high levels of organic matter and various chemical compounds especially detergents and dyes , the use of Zarqa water for irrigation has significantly altered the biodiversity of the natural flora, and caused the disappearance of the majority of fresh water species. In prehistoric times, the area was rich with fauna, and 45 distinct animal species have been identified, half of them wild animals. Domesticated goats were the most common, and gazelles were the most frequently occurring wild animal species. Today, the area is still home to a diverse population of birds and mammals, and some of the breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan. Among the bird species found are the European roller, desert lark, Dead Sea sparrow, desert finch and blue cheeked bee eater. The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species. Notable birds found in the lake area include the little bittern, cattle egrets, grey herons, white storks, common teal and Eurasian coot. The lake's waters sustain fish, some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species. The most common are tilapia. Migratory birds also winter in the man made pools which make up the Kherbit Al Samra Sewage Treatment Plant, located in a broad depression close to Wadi Dhulayl, the main tributary of the Zarqa River. As many as 6,000 white storks have been spotted roosting there. Mammals found in the area include the common otter Lutra lutra , and the Persian squirrel Sciurus anomalus . The otter is considered a threatened species. The Zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting the Eastern Desert with the Jordan Valley. 'Ain Ghazal, the origin of the spring the feeds the Zarqa river, is a major archaeological site, dating back to the Neolithic period. It was continuously occupied for more than two thousand years, and the earliest finds date to 7200 BCE. 'Ain Ghazal is one of the earliest known human settlements with evidence of domesticated animals. With a population of around 3,000 at its height, it was also one of the largest prehistoric population centers in the Near East, with about five time the population of neighboring Jericho. During a 1982 survey of the Zarqa Valley, a number of Early Iron Age sites were discovered, concentrated along the banks of the Zerqa and its tributaries. One of them, Tulul adh Dhahab, is under further research now. Wadi Jarash, a northern tributary of the Zarqa River, flows through the modern city of Jerash. Inhabited since the Bronze Age, Jerash was an important Greco Roman city known as Gerasa, home to noted mathematician Nicomachus. The ruins of the city are well preserved and have been extensively excavated. Zarqa, Jordan's second largest city, is built on the banks of the Zarqa River, and is the largest settlement along its course. The town of Zarqa was founded in 1902 by Chechen immigrants. Its population grew rapidly with an influx of Palestinian refugees who fled the West Bank during the Six Day War. The Zarqa river is highly polluted. In many areas, raw sewage flows untreated directly into the river through dry riverbeds wadis , contaminating it and creating a stench which has been a cause of numerous complaints, particularly during the summer months. Though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations including Ain Ghazal and Khirbet As Samra , these stations often receive more water than they can handle. Such overflow occurs during winter floods, as well as during summer months when the population increases with the return of migrant workers to Amman. During overflow, untreated water runs directly to the Zarqa river. As a result, the Zarqa's water is brownish colored, often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter. Other sources of pollutants are the illegal dumping of industrial waste, including those from textile factories, and batteries and oils from garages. The river's watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River, and it flows through an industrialized area that is home to more than 52 of Jordan's industrial plants, including the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company. During the summer months, treated domestic and industrial waste water compose nearly all of the flow, and substantially degrade the water quality. Coupled with over extraction of water from the underground aquifer and the naturally low base flow of the Zarqa, this has created a major problem, described as one of Jordan's environmental black spots . and has made rehabilitation of the Zarqa a top priority for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment. The restoration project is estimated to cost 30 million. Coordinates 321130N 354806E 32.19167N 35.80167E 32.19167 35.80167",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarqa%20River
"Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta Polish Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta na wiezy katedry w roku 1521 w Krakowie, English The Hanging of the Sigismund bell at the Cathedral Tower in 1521 in Krakow is a painting by Jan Matejko finished in 1874. It depicts the installation of the Sigismund Bell in the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow in 1521. The bell was installed in the Sigismund Tower and rung for the first time on 13 July 1521. The bell is considered to be one of the national symbols of Poland. This painting is one of a number of historical paintings by Matejko. It shows a crowd of people, with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance. It conveys the Golden Era of the Polish Renaissance, and the power of the Kingdom of Poland. There are several alternative names for the painting. They include The consecrating of the Sigismund bell... Poswiecenie dzwonu Zygmunta... , as proposed by Mieczysaw Treter, The raising of the Sigismund bell..., King Sigismund's Bell, or just Sigismund Bell Dzwon Zygmunta . The Sigismund Bell painting was created in 1874. During his work, Matejko commissioned craftsmen to create a replica of a scaffolding that was used to move the bell, and he identified its likely original location, in order for it to be portrayed realistically. There are numerous anecdotes associated with this painting. Matejko used his family for models, and likely the painting contains nearly all the members of his family. The painting was well received by contemporaries, and Stanisaw Tarnowski published an extensive and positive review in 1875 in Przeglad Polski. The work was displayed in Paris in 1875, and probably contributed to Matejko's recognition by the Academie francaise three years later it was displayed there again, during the Exposition Universelle 1878 , and together with two other paintings the Unia lubelska Union of Lublin and Wacaw Wilczek yielded him an honorary golden medal. The painting is in the collection of the National Museum, Warsaw. Matejko was deeply interested in the era of the Renaissance in Poland, and this painting is one of a number of historical paintings that he set in that period. The composition is very colorful, yet realistic. It conveys the Golden Era of Polish Renaissance, and the power of the contemporary Kingdom of Poland, both its elites and the common people. The left side of the painting is focused on the richness and glory of the era, while the right notes the hard work of ordinary people that made this greatness possible. Although the painting is usually known as The hanging of the Sigismund bell.., in fact it shows not the moment of hanging but the moment of the bell's emergence from the mold in which it was cast. The painting shows a crowd, with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance. On the left, there is the royal court, but only the king, Sigismund I, his family including queen Bona Sforza , and the court jester, Stanczyk, can be identified. Sigismund, the patron of the Sigismund Bell, and his son Sigismund August, were Polish kings that inspired other works of Matejko, including The Babin Republic 1881 and The Founding of the Lubranski Academy in Poznan 1886 . Sigismund I's portrayal on the Hanging... painting is the one where Matejko shows him with pride and respect. Other figures in the court include banker Jan Boner, merchant and official Seweryn Bethman, and castellan and voivode Stanisaw Kmita. Bishop Jan Chojenski is also shown on the painting, consecrating the bell, with canon Grzegorz Lubranski nearby. Outside the court, master bell founder Hans Beham is seen above the bell. Between him and the court there are two dark clad figures. These are the Wawel architect Bartolommeo Berrecci, and a musician, Valentin Bakfark, who according to a legend threw a string from his instrument into the melted bronze in fact, he arrived in Poland two decades after the bell was cast . In the background, Wawel Castle can be seen. As he would often do, Matejko included people whom he considered significant for the era, but who could not be present in the scene, like Sigismund I's son, Sigismund II August, who would have been only one year old. In 1885 Matejko would paint a sequel like picture, Zygmunt I suchajacy Dzwonu Zygmunta Sigismund I listening to the Sigismund Bell , showing an older Sigismund and Stanczyk, contemplating the passing of their era.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawieszenie%20dzwonu%20Zygmunta
"Adele Zay 29 February 1848 29 December 1928 was a Transylvanian teacher, feminist and pedagogue. Her family were part of the German speaking community of the Kingdom of Hungary. Because of her father's death during her infancy, Zay's education was interrupted by periods where she taught to earn money in order to continue private and formal studies. In 1880 after studying abroad in Vienna and Gotha, she passed her primary education certification for Germany and Hungary. The following year, she was certified as a secondary teacher, becoming the first Transylvanian woman to have earned a higher education. From 1875 to 1884, she taught at the Institute of Irma Kemendy in Szeged. After almost a decade in Szeged, Zay accepted a post at a newly established normal school for training kindergarten teachers in Kronstadt Brasso . Though ostensibly a teacher, from the beginning Zay was the creative force behind the development of the school and designed the syllabus. She led the school from 1884 to 1927, becoming its official director in 1922. Simultaneously with her relocation to Kronstadt, Zay joined the General Women's Association of the Transylvanian Evangelical Church and became one of the leaders in pressing for women's rights. She successfully agitated for kindergarten and handicraft teachers to be recognized as educators and entitled to pensions. She lobbied for the teaching profession to be opened to women, which was accomplished in 1901, and for a women's normal school to be established, which occurred in 1903. Zay wrote books on the theory of child education which were distributed throughout Hungary and Germany and used as training texts until World War II. Having made contact during her studies abroad with international feminists, Zay pressed for women to be given the right to vote. In 1918, her campaign resulted in women gaining the ability to vote in church elections. She founded the Freie Sachsische Frauenbund Free Saxon Women's League in 1920 as an umbrella organization to help women agitate for socio political rights from the Kingdom of Romania, under whose jurisdiction Transylvania fell after the conclusion of World War I. In the 1920s, she served as a member of parliament and a member of the District Committee for the People's Council of Burzenland. She remained active in educational and political movements until her death in 1928. Adele Zay was born on leap day 1848 in Hermannstadt, in the Principality of Transylvania, Austrian Empire today Sibiu, Romania to Rosa nee Graef and Daniel Adolf Zay. Her family was Transylvanian Saxon, part of the ethnically German, Lutheran population which had been invited by the Hungarian king to settle in Transylvania from the 12th century. The German communities in which they lived maintained political autonomy from the 17th to the last quarter of the 19th century. She was the fourth daughter in the family and had a younger brother, Gustav Adolf Adolf , who would become a lawyer and Hungarian parliamentarian. Her father was High Court Judge for the regional court, but he died shortly after Adolf's birth in 1850. He left his wife only a small pension, which was inadequate for educating her children. Zay, who aspired to become a teacher, attended the Protestant girls' school and supplemented her education with private lessons in languages and natural sciences. By the age of 17, Zay had begun tutoring and within three years was teaching French and German at the Madchenerziehungsanstalt von Philippine Barreaud Philippine Barreaud Girls' Educational Institute in Hermannstadt. When the school closed in 1873, she moved to the Cotroceni neighborhood of Bucharest and taught at the Madchenerziehungs und Lehrerinnenbildungsanstalt Asyl Helene Helena Asylum Girls' Educational and Teacher Training Institute , where one of her older sisters was employed as a teacher. The Helena Asylum was an orphanage established in 1862 by Elena Cuza, the princess consort of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. It was later operated under the patronage of Queen Elisabeth of Wied. Zay taught classes in German language, geography, and history. In 1875, wanting to further her education, Zay went to Vienna and took a training seminar with Friedrich Dittes, a school reformer and advocate of the Frobel method. She also undertook private lessons in Gotha with August Kohler, an adherent of Frobel's principals who instructed her in pedagogy. By December, Zay had secured a new post, teaching English and German languages, geography and mathematics at the Institute of Irma Kemendy in Szeged. While teaching, Zay continued her own studies at the Kemendy Institute's normal school. In 1880, she passed the examination to teach in German and Hungarian state elementary schools. The following year, she passed an additional exam at the Budapest Public Normal School to teach French and English, becoming the first Transylvanian Saxon teacher certified to teach secondary education. She continued teaching and worked as an administrator at the Kemendy Institute until 1884, when the presbyterium of the Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession invited her to teach in their newly established normal school for training kindergarten teachers. After almost a decade in Szeged, Zay accepted the post at the Kindergartnerinnenbildungsanstalt von der Evangelischen Landeskirche AB KBA AB Kindergarten Teachers Training College of the Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession and moved to Kronstadt Brasso . Though appointed as a classroom teacher under the headmaster, from the beginning Zay was the driving force and creative leader of the institution. As the only woman with a degree in higher education, she was entrusted with creating the syllabus, which included classes in educational and kindergarten theory, German and Hungarian languages, geography, history, and a practicum. Having been exposed to the women's movement during her studies in Germany over the previous decade, Zay joined the General Women's Association of the Transylvanian Evangelical Church upon its founding in 1884 and became one of the leaders in pressing for women's rights. In 1888, she presented a lecture Die Frau als Lehrerin The Woman as Teacher arguing that equal rights should be employed in the girls' schools operated by the Transylvanian Evangelical Church. She pointed out that in 1887 a proposal for hiring women teachers had been rejected based on the rationale that the Church would have to open and operate a normal school to train them. At the 1889 National Exhibition for Infant Education in Budapest, Zay was honored with a citation for her work while the courses she taught at the school won the gold prize. Also that year, the KBA AB curriculum was approved by the Hungarian crown and by 1891 her work and changes in the government requirements had transformed early education in Hungary. In 1892, the school was officially accredited by the state and two years later Zay designed a three month long continuing education course to prepare caretakers for rural children, while their parents were engaged in planting and harvesting. The social work done by these caretakers, who focused on teaching children their native language and customs, built bridges between rural families and the towns where the caretakers lived. Also in 1894, she successfully appealed to the church authorities, arguing that kindergarten and handicraft teachers, who taught technical skill and helped preserve folk art but were not considered educators, should qualify for retirement pensions. In 1896, Zay published Theorie und Praxis der Kleinkindererziehung Theory and Practice of Infant Education , a textbook which expressed the importance of the kindergarten in children's social development. She instructed teachers to allow children to learn from supervised activity and observation, noting that playing with each other stimulated their development as members of their community. Revised and republished under the title Theorie und Praxis des Kindergartens Theory and Practice of the Kindergarten in 1916, the book was widely used in Germany to train teachers until the advent of World War II. In 1898, Zay published a second book, Hilfsbuchlein zur Heranbildung von Leiterinnen von Sommerbewahranstalten Help Booklet for the Further Education of Women Leading Summer Shelters , giving practical advice for teachers to organize summer activities for children to continue their socialization. A second edition was issued in 1918. After numerous petitions to the authorities, in 1901 Zay was finally successful in her push to open the teaching profession to women. A further success occurred when the first Transylvanian normal school for women opened in 1903 in Schaburg Segesvar . Having used her summers to further her own education in England, France, and Germany, Zay made contact with international feminists, like Minna Cauer and Jeanette Schwerin. She began to agitate for changes in child labor laws, called for the suppression of national rhetoric in publications and speeches, and championed the cause of equality, including suffrage for women. In the aftermath of World War I, and the HungarianRomanian War, the Kingdom of Romania gained jurisdiction over Transylvania. In 1918, women gained the right to vote in church elections and in 1920, Zay founded the Freie Sachsische Frauenbund Free Saxon i.e. German speaking Women's League . The umbrella organization aimed to unite ethnically German women's groups for socio political action within the Romanian state. Through the group, she continued to press for women's education, calling for secondary technical education for girls and introducing up bringing and nursery care courses at girls' high schools. Elected as a member of parliament in 1920, Zay also served as a member of the District Committee for the People's Council of Burzenland. She was officially named director of the KBA AB in 1922, holding the post until she retired in 1927. In her 43 year tenure, she had succeeded in graduating over 830 students. In 1924, Zay implemented changes to incorporate the new cultural policies required by the Romanian state, and the following year she was elected President of the Women's League. For her 80th birthday in 1928, the league organized a national fundraiser, collecting over 250,000 Romanian lei to establish the Adele Zay Foundation for the Preservation of Saxon Kindergartens. Zay died on 29 December 1928 in Kronstadt, following a short illness caused by a heart attack. She was the first woman to lie in state at the Black Church there, before being buried according to her wishes at the Hermannstadt Town Cemetery. She is remembered for her contributions to professionalize teaching, for establishing kindergartens in Transylvania based upon Frobel's principles, and for her efforts to empower women. In 1929, the KBA AB was renamed as the Adele Zay School , but was dissolved by the Romanian government in 1949. The Free Saxon Women's League, founded by Zay, was renamed the German Saxon Federation of Women in 1930. In Drabenderhohe , Germany, a benevolent association which bears her name was founded in 1962. The association created the Haus Siebenburgen, Alten und Pflegeheim Transylvania House, Old People's Home and Treatment Center in 1966 to care for elderly Transylvanians, erecting a bust and plaque honoring Zay in the foyer. The association also established a kindergarten in 1992 and a second kindergarten in 1995, both administered by the City of Wiehl.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele%20Zay
"Ahmed Zayat zjt Arabic , also known as Ephraim David Zayat Hebrew , born August 31, 1962 is an Egyptian American businessman and owner of Thoroughbred race horses. He is the CEO of Zayat Stables, LLC, a Thoroughbred horse racing business which bred and owns the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Joe Drape of The New York Times described Zayat as controversial and one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing. Zayat was born in Cairo, Egypt to a wealthy family, and grew up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood where he learned to ride horses. At age 18, he moved to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master's degree in business and public health from Boston University. After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City, he returned to Egypt, and for about a decade ran the Al Ahram Beverages Company, which he owned as part of an investment group. After the company was purchased by Heineken in 2002, Zayat stayed on a few more years but also began investing in racehorses and established Zayat Stables in 2005. Upon returning to the United States for good in 2007, he made his racing stables his full time occupation, working with his son, Justin, to build the business. While generally successful with his race horses, Zayat's goal of winning the Kentucky Derby eluded him several times, including three second place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award. The Zayat family are Orthodox Jews. Zayat currently lives in Teaneck, New Jersey with his wife, Joanne. They have four children Ashley, Justin, Benjamin, and Emma. Their eldest son, Justin, helps run the Zayat Stables operation, and their youngest, Emma, inspired the name of Littleprincessemma, dam of American Pharoah. Ahmed Zayat was born in Egypt in 1962 to an affluent Egyptian Jewish family and grew up an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the Cairo suburb of Maadi. His father, Alaa al Zayat, was a prominent doctor and professor of medicine, a personal physician to Anwar Sadat. His grandfather, Ahmed Hasan al Zayyat, was a leading intellectual who established the Egyptian literary magazine al Risala, described as the most important intellectual weekly in 1930s Egypt and the Arab world. Born into what was then a peasant family, the earlier al Zayyat studied at Al Azhar University before taking up legal studies in Cairo and Paris he taught Arabic literature at American University in Cairo, and for three years in Baghdad, before founding al Risala in 1933. As a young man, Ahmed Zayat learned to ride horses at the local country club. Zayat competed in show jumping during his early teens, winning national titles as a child in the under 12 and under 14 age divisions. He moved to the United States at the age of 18, and earned an undergraduate degree from Yeshiva University. He obtained a master's degree in public health administration from Boston University. Though the Zayat Stables, LLC website once stated that Zayat attended Harvard University, he did not. After graduation, he worked for Zev Wolfson, a New York City commercial real estate developer and investor. Zayat described Wolfson as the toughest guy I ever worked for ... such a perfectionist. A great negotiator. Zayat returned to Egypt in 1995 and formed an investment group, which purchased the Al Ahram Beverages Company in 1997, outbidding Anheuser Busch and Heineken International. Al Ahram had been owned by the Egyptian government and Zayat had helped find American investors to take over government owned businesses that had been nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser back in the 1950s. The original beer product was of poor quality, mocked as being able to power heavy machinery if there was no diesel fuel available. Under Zayat's leadership, additional brands of beer were introduced, and he developed a non alcoholic beer, Fayrouz, designed specifically for the Muslim market. The company was modernized from a run down operation to a publicly traded business that sold in 2002 to Heineken International for 280 million, more than three times its pre acquisition valuation, in what was then the largest corporate buyout in Egyptian history. Zayat continued to run Al Ahram until 2007, but periodically returned to the United States, where he started buying racehorses and formed Zayat Stables in 2005. His motivation to return to the US was, in part, to commute less and be more involved with his family and children. Upon leaving Al Ahram, he declared that he was retiring , but as his wife explained, he can't be retired for more than 15 seconds, and he soon expanded his horse operation to include both breeding and racing stock. He still owns other business interests in Egypt, including being the majority shareholder of Misr Glass Manufacturing, which is Egypt's largest maker of glass containers. Zayat lives in Teaneck, New Jersey, with his wife, Joanne. The couple have four children Ashley, Justin, Benjamin and Emma. Justin, a 2015 graduate of New York University, works closely with his father in the Zayat Stables business. While residing primarily in New Jersey, the Zayats also have residences in New York, Egypt and London. The family are Orthodox Jews Zayat's Hebrew name is Ephraim , used by family and community. Zayat donates to Jewish schools and charities, including those that help special needs children. Although The New York Times has stated that Zayat has publicly identified as both Jewish and Muslim at times, his family attends Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, keeps the Jewish Sabbath, and observes kosher laws regarding food. When questioned about his religious affiliation, Zayat stated, Why is it relevant, and why does it matter It's personal. Zayat first began buying Thoroughbred race horses in 2005. Zayat Stables owns approximately 200 horses at any one time. Zayat made a number of big ticket sales purchases early on including a horse he named Maimonides, purchased at Keeneland as a yearling in 2006 for 4.6 million. In addition, Zayat paid 1.6 million for the highest priced horse at the 2006 Fasig Tipton Saratoga select yearling sale, a filly by Empire Maker named Mushka, whom he resold in 2008 for 2.4 million. Maimonides was named in honor of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who is respected by both Jews and Muslims. At the time, Zayat explained, If this horse was going to be a superstar, I wanted an appropriate name... I wanted it to be pro peace, and about loving your neighbor. Zayat also had difficulty obtaining the name from the Jockey Club, as it had been reserved by Earle I. Mack, who owned race horses and also happened to be the chairman of the board of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, at Zayat's alma mater, Yeshiva University. After Zayat donated 100,000 to the school to promote peace, Mack released his reservation of the name. But, in the first of Zayat's many racing disappointments, the colt's promising racing career was cut short by injury after two races. The horses of Zayat Stables began to earn race purses in 2006. In 2008, Zayat was North America's leading owner by earnings. Zayat Stables ranked second in the nation for earnings in 2007, third in 2009, fourth in 2010 and fifth nationally in 2011. Between 2006 and 2014, Zayat Stables ranked in the top ten leading owners by purse money won in six of those years and always in the top 20. Zayat has horses at all stages of the racing process, stallions, broodmares, young horses in training and active racing stock. His daughters were the inspiration for the names of two race horses, stakes winner Point Ashley, who in turn inspired daughter Ashley's costume jewelry business name and Littleprincessemma, dam of American Pharoah. Race horse Justin Phillip was named for Justin. The business base for the horse racing operation is Hackensack, New Jersey, but Zayat's horses live in different locations across the US. His horse breeding stock live mostly in Kentucky, young horses are started in Florida. The racing stock have been in training with multiple trainers including Bob Baffert, Mark Casse, D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher, Dale Romans and others. Zayat Stables keeps about 30 broodmares and their foals in Kentucky along with roughly 20 yearlings. In 2015 the operation stood 13 breeding stallions at stud. Zayat typically retains a 25 interest in the stallions he sends to stud, though in the case of Pioneerof the Nile, he kept a 75 interest. As of 2015 , Zayat's horses include American Pharoah and 13 other Grade I winners. These include 2013 Breeders' Cup runner and 2012 Haskell Invitational winner Paynter 2013 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap winner Justin Phillip 2012 Arkansas Derby winner Bodemeister Pioneerof the Nile who won the 2008 CashCall Futurity and 2009 Santa Anita Derby three time Grade I winner Zensational. He has entered horses in the Breeders' Cup races 16 times, with his best result a fourth place finish in 2007. Zayat has experienced significant highs and lows in his quest for Triple Crown classic wins. Three times Zayat's horses placed second in the Kentucky Derby. In 2009, Zayat's homebred Pioneerof the Nile started a streak of Zayat horses finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and other classic races when he was defeated by Mine That Bird. In 2010, Zayat campaigned Eskendereya, winner of the Wood Memorial and considered the favorite for the Kentucky Derby. On the Sunday prior to the Derby, Eskendereya was withdrawn from the race and subsequently retired to stud due to a soft tissue injury that would have taken at least a year to heal. In 2011, Zayat entered Nehro, who finished second to Animal Kingdom. In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister and then Paynter ran second in each of the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister finished a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award. Zayat's Triple Crown race losing streak was finally broken by American Pharoah, who won the 2015 Kentucky Derby, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, and the 2015 Belmont Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown since 1978. Zayat has been described as controversial, and one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing by Joe Drape of the New York Times his success accompanied by a number of legal controversies. His racing stable survived Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and he faced a number of legal issues associated with his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing. In December 2009, Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for an alleged 34 million in unpaid loans. He had taken out multiple loans from the bank totaling over 38 million between 2007 and 2009. Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009. As part of the loan package, the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables' horses, prize money, stallion shares and stallion income. Further, the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating, if Zayat Stables defaulted on any of the Notes, such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the principal balance and all accrued interest due and owing under all of the Notes. While Zayat paid off some of the money owed, the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan. The bank alleged that Zayat had lost 52 million between 2006 and 2008, that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat, and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses. Zayat filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2010. He stated that the problem was that the Lexington branch of the bank worked with the Thoroughbred industry and was willing to restructure his loans, while the bank's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati wanted to get out of the equine lending business altogether. Stating that Fifth Third was reneging on its promises, Zayat filed a countersuit in April 2010, alleging the bank engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices. When he thought the bank was willing to restructure its loans, Zayat withdrew 67 horses he intended to sell at Keeneland's 2009 September and November sales and instead purchased 24 more yearlings. He had also paid Fifth Third 4.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of breeding rights to Zensational, all of which left him low on cash when the bank called in its loans. Zayat said the bank was using scorched earth tactics and accused it of trying to put him out of business, explaining that had he known the bank would not extend his loans, he would have sold enough horses to make his payments. All cases were resolved with a settlement agreement in July 2010, seven months after the initial suit was filed. Zayat agreed to pay off his unsecured creditors over two years, without interest, and pay off Fifth Third by 2014. Zayat Stables' creditors unanimously approved the repayment plan. Zayat owed about 2.4 million to the Keeneland Association, and 1.2 million to other creditors including clinics, horse transport companies, boarding farms, and trainersamong them Bob Baffert. He also owed several horse breeders for stud fees. To settle his debts with Fifth Third, he agreed to annual payments based on a percentage of horse sales and proceeds from claiming races. As part of his reorganization plan, he was to sell a number of horses, including 100 of his Grade I winning horse Eskendereya. Ultimately, consistent with Zayat's tendency to retain a financial interest in his stallions, he sold an undisclosed share in the stallion to Jess Jackson and retained some breeding rights. While the selling percentage and price were confidential, Zayat Stables' reported income to the bankruptcy court for the month the deal closed was 7.5 million. Zayat stated, While Chapter 11 was a necessary step to take ... I look forward to carrying out our reorganization plan, and continuing to develop some of the best horses in the country. Zayat Stables successfully completed the bankruptcy reorganization plan, in the process his stable went from a high of 285 horses to a census of 118 in 2012. Zayat's bankruptcy revealed other problems. His bankruptcy documents listed four loans he had made to members of the Jelinsky family. Two members of that family, Michael and Jeffrey Jelinsky, had pleaded guilty in 2009 to illegal bookmaking. As a result, the racing commissions in California and Kentucky opened investigations on Zayat racing licensees are not to associate with bookmakers or convicted felons. Zayat claimed that he had no knowledge of the Jelinskys' illegal acts. He stated that he thought the brothers were professional gamblers and that they had financial need. Further, he said he loaned them money because he knew their father and that the money they owed him was unrelated to gambling he stated that some of the money he loaned was to assist one of the brothers with a divorce. He was cleared in both states. Although New York also stated that they were investigating, there were no news reports of any adverse action. Zayat stated that he had been visited by federal agents who played tapes where the Jelinsky brothers discussed how they had cheated Zayat out of money by giving him bad betting advice. In an unrelated case, Zayat was mentioned in a 2013 lawsuit between Freehold Raceway and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The plaintiffs alleged that Zayat was allowed to bet on credit, which was a violation of state law. Zayat had been betting 200,000 a week through New Jersey's online betting system, and the agency allowed him to float 286,000 in credit, as a courtesy. Zayat was not a party to the lawsuit and he paid off all debts owed to the Sports Authority. The records containing Zayat's name were later redacted, but an internal email indicated that Zayat had wagered a total of at least 8.3 million. On March 10, 2014, a lawsuit against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff, Howard Rubinsky, was an associate of the Jelinskys who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation. His suit alleged breach of contract, claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a 1.65 million line of credit in 2004. Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds Sportsbook so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica. Zayat's lawyer described the suit as a meritless claim , filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence, and argued that the statute of limitations of six years had run. Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky, but said, I can say unequivocally that I did not give Mr. Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because he told me he was ill and broke. On June 4, 2015, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed Rubinsky's lawsuit, citing both Rubinsky's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations. In a related matter, June 1, 2015, days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the New York Times reported that Rubinsky's lawyer, Joseph Bainton, filed a 10 million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press, including the characterization of Rubinsky's other lawsuit as extortion, a fraud and blackmail. That suit was dismissed on August 5, 2015. In a post race press conference after winning the 2015 Belmont Stakes, Zayat stated that he was so anxious about American Pharoah's upcoming race that he neglected to bet on anything.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed%20Zayat
"A zduhac Cyrillic , pronounced and vetrovnjak , in Serbian tradition, and a dragon man in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian traditions, were men believed to have an inborn supernatural ability to protect their estate, village, or region against destructive weather conditions, such as storms, hail, or torrential rains. It was believed that the souls of these men could leave their bodies in sleep, to intercept and fight with demonic beings imagined as bringers of bad weather. Having defeated the demons and taken away the stormy clouds they brought, the protectors would return into their bodies and wake up tired. Notions associated with the zduhac, vetrovnjak, and dragon man, respectively, are not identical. The dragon man fought against female demons called ala, which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops, and consumed the fertility of the fields. The zduhaci plural of an area usually fought together against the attacking zduhaci of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields. The victorious zduhaci would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes, and take it to their own region. The vetrovnjak, recorded in parts of western Serbia, fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird. The zduhaci are recorded in Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sandzak region of south western Serbia. The dragon men are recorded in eastern Serbia, Banat, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia. In Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sandzak region of south western Serbia, a man who was thought to be able to protect his estate, village, or region from bad weather was called a zduhac or a stuha. These names have a number of variants, which can be with or without h, with v instead of h, with or without the ending c, and with c instead of c. According to philologist Franz Miklosich, the Serbian word stuhac is cognate with the Old Slavonic stuhia .mw parser output .script slavonic font family Ponomar Unicode , Ponomar Unicode TT , Monomakh Unicode , Monomakh Unicode TT , Menaion Unicode , Menaion Unicode TT , Fedorovsk Unicode , Fedorovsk Unicode TT ,BukyVede, Kliment Std , RomanCyrillic Std , Monomachus , Old Standard , Old Standard TT ,Dilyana,Menaion, Menaion Medieval ,Lazov,Code2000, DejaVu Sans , DejaVu Serif ,Code2001, FreeSerif , TITUS Cyberbit Basic , Charis SIL , Doulos SIL , Chrysanthi Unicode , Bitstream Cyberbit , Bitstream CyberBase ,Thryomanes, Lucida Grande , FreeSans , Arial Unicode MS , Microsoft Sans Serif , Lucida Sans Unicode .mw parser output .script glagolitic font family Menaion Unicode TT , Menaion Unicode ,Vikidemia,Bukyvede,FreeSerif,Ja,Unicode5, TITUS Cyberbit Basic , Noto Sans Glagolitic , Segoe UI Historic , Segoe UI Symbol or stihia the elements , which stem from the Old Greek stoicheion element . The latter name is the origin of the Modern Greek stikhio , denoting various kinds of spirits in Greek folklore, such as those fighting for the well being of their village or area against adverse spirits from elsewhere. According to linguists Petar Skok and Norbert Jokl, stuhac stems from the Albanian stuhi storm . In any case, the form zduhac may have resulted from folk etymology through association with the Serbian duh spirit . The notion that the human being consists of body and soul is found in traditional Slavic culture. There was a belief among the South Slavs that, in some people, the soul could leave the body and again return into it. The zduhac belonged to such people in Serbian tradition. It was thought that, after a zduhac fell asleep, his soul could fly out of his body, or go into the winds , as it was said in Montenegro. In some accounts, it exited the body in the form of a fly. The zduhac's soul had the power to direct the motion of winds and clouds. If the body of the sleeping zduhac was rotated so that his head and feet changed places, or if he was carried away from where he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and the zduhac would die. Although zduhaci plural could be women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power was thought to be inborn. In many regions it was regarded that the zduhaci were born with a caulwhite or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuci, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhac. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhac in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaci, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaci. A 19th century ethnographic account from eastern Herzegovina describes a way through which a man who was not born as a zduhac could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhac. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, zduhac could pass his supernatural power on to his son. The appearance of zduhaci was not much different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaci were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, and to be able to communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Pastrovici from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaci could hear any doings anywhere in the world if someone stepped on a zduhac's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuci held that the zduhaci were outstanding long jumpers. Adverse weather such as a storm or hail could devastate crop fields and orchards, and thus jeopardize the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaci, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhac could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhac to destroy its crops. The other zduhac would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, and there would be a fight between the zduhaci. They fought alone, or in bands composed of individuals from the same area. Thus it was thought that the zduhaci from eastern Bosnia fought together against those from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The zduhaci from Sandzak fought jointly against the Albanian zduhaci. On the Adriatic coast, battles were waged between a band of zduhaci from Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and northern Albania on one side, and a band of zduhaci from Apulia in southeast Italy on the other side. The latter were also called the transmarine zduhaci, as Apulia is situated across the Adriatic Sea from Montenegro. Each band had its leader. A man named Mato Glusac 17741870 , from the village of Korita in Herzegovina, was reputed the supreme commander of the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin zduhaci he was also a famous seer. According to some accounts, zduhaci flew and fought mostly in spring when strong winds blew, and, as held in some regions, only during night. As recorded in Montenegro, the zduhaci went into the winds usually during the Nativity Fast 15 November 24 December , when there was not much snow and the winds were forceful. They also flew frequently from mid February to the end of March. In some years, they were not active at all. The zduhaci of a band would leave their bodies in sleep and gather at an appointed place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaci uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhac weapon was held to be a stick of luc resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhac who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half burned. Beside the weapons, each zduhac carried a milk bucket and a peck measure an alternative for the latter could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaci succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuci, zduhaci used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory. The battles of zduhaci were furious. They were accompanied by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhac, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhac was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhac he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaci would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaci. After the battle, the soul of the zduhac would return into his body, and he would wake up weak and exhausted. If he was wounded, he would be sick for some time afterwardsbefore he recovered, or died if his wound was mortal. There are records of seriously ill men who claimed that they were wounded in zduhac battles. It was held in Montenegrin Littoral that a mortally wounded zduhac could still recuperate if he revenged himself on his wounder before the eighth day of his wound expired. Pavel Rovinski, Russian philologist and ethnographer, recorded a story told to him by a man of the clan of Ceklin in southern Montenegro Rovinski also heard a similar story in Montenegrin Littoral There was a Ceklin zduhac who was so beaten by other zduhaci that he had to die, and there he was, dying. Various remedies were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother I will surely die, if I am not substituted for and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength. The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued You will have to go tonight to Mount So and so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath. I will also take a musket, added the brother, and the sick man said, You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife. I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred, interrupted the brother again. Take it easy with your boldness, resumed the sick man, and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, and there will be a silence in the air then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth a light haired, a pied, and a dark haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife but take care not to cut the light haired bull that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light haired bull. Having heard all of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and sharpened the flints he put the pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest he came beneath the stair like cliff the moon and the stars were shining, so it was like a day a silence all around him, pleasant he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife it staggered and fell the light haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark haired bull, and it slumped the light haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared together with it, the light haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick. An interpretation of the story about the Ceklin zduhac is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordic. According to him, the story is a product of the symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhac narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaci, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhac and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhac, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhac into a subject without identity. Kordic argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the storythat of the death drivewhich crumbles the other two narrations. In a story recorded in the area of Cetinje, a zduhac was mortally wounded on Mount Lovcen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaci. The dying zduhac disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhac sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birac, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhac could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhac. Most zduhaci would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaci. As thought in Herzegovina, a man who did not want to be a zduhac anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore. Zduhaci were regarded as a blessing for their home and village, as guardians of the prosperity and well being of their region, and as good, honest, just, and law obeying people. In the region of Birac, zduhaci were said to meet with angels on the leaves of high and thick branches . They were sometimes thought to have a prophetic gift. However, a zduhac could ally himself with the Devil, and use his innate power in accordance with the Devil's directions. That zduhac was doomed to turn into a vampire, unless he confessed and repented. Some influential historical persons were believed to have been zduhaci, such as warrior and writer Marko Miljanov, and Petar I Petrovic Njegos, who was the Prince Bishop of Montenegro from 1784 to 1830. Mahmud Bushatli, the Ottoman pasha of Skadar in northern Albania, was reputed a powerful zduhac in Montenegro. It was claimed that his mother carried him for three years. Bushatli was defeated and killed by the Montenegrins under Petar I, while attempting to subdue them in 1796. Since that time, the crop yield in Montenegro and northern Albania was allegedly not as high as before. Bushatli was said to have fought for the crop yield against the transmarine zduhaci. Petar I was reported saying of him, I regret his death although he was my biggest enemy. After Bushatli was killed, his body was burned according to oral accounts, green flames rose from it. In South Slavic tradition, green could be associated with supernatural creatures, like witches and dragons. An individual domestic animal could also be regarded as a zduhac, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhac. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhac would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaci, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaci they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Uzice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaci who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three year old rooster defended their village from themespecially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail. In some regions of southern Montenegro, such as the Bay of Kotor, Grbalj, and Zagarac, and in parts of Herzegovina, a man who acted as a zduhac was called a vjedogonja or jedogonja. There was a rule if a child was born with a caul, the girl would become a vjestica witch , and the boy would become a vjedogonja. This could have been prevented by cutting the caul on a trough for feeding dogs, and throwing it away the child would then grow up into an ordinary person. While the zduhaci and vjedogonje plural protected their community from the threats coming from the outside, the witches were the enemy within, doing harm primarily to their own relatives and friends. A correspondence between the witches and the vjedogonje can be seen in a passage from The Mountain Wreath, a poetic drama by Petar II Petrovic Njegos, the plot of which takes place in 18th century Montenegro , , , ' . God and His angels be with us Why here you have dashed, O Bishop, into some confused winds, like a witch when she dashes in March or a vjedogonja in the gloomy autumn. A man named Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, one of the main characters of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is to dash into a frenzied countenance , meaning to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation . Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream. The vjedogonje fought in regional bands, their weapons being huge boulders or gigantic trees which they uprooted with one hand. The leaders among them were those who had a tail and were hairy. A 19th century ethnographic account describes that when a man regarded as a vjedogonja dies, they drive hawthorn spines under his nails, and cut the tendons beneath his knees with a knife whose sheath is black, so that he could not get out of his grave like a vampire . Petar I Petrovic Njegos preached among people against superstition. He strongly condemned the denunciation and persecution of women as witches. After one such incident in 1830 in south Montenegro, Petar I wrote an epistle, mentioning vjedogonje in a sentence Nowhere have I found nor has anyone told me that witches and vjedogonje exist, except in the blind and sad Serbian people, because it is blind and believes lies rather than Christ's Gospel and Christ's teachings and commands. In the folklore of Croats of Ravni Kotari, a region in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They were believed to know past and future things. People paid them to cure the sick, which they did by saying prayers and making the sign of the cross all over the patient's body. The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly. In the region of Mount Zlatibor in western Serbia, the man who protected the fields of his village from bad weather was called a vetrovnjak the name is derived from vetar wind . At the onset of a storm, the vetrovnjak would fall into a trance like sleep. It was thought that his soul then flew skywards to fight against some black bird which led the storm and hail clouds. After he woke up, he had to rest for some time to restore his physical strength. It was believed that a vetrovnjak could take the bad clouds over the estate of a man with whom he was in a conflict. In the region of Dragacevo, western Serbia, people told of the vilovit men, who would disappear at the sight of hail clouds, reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after the storm was over. Asked where they had been to, they would only answer that they had gone to fight against those who led the hail clouds toward their village. The adjective vilovit means having a vila's properties or vila like . The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies, female anthropomorphic spirits of woods, mountains, clouds, and waters, who had magical powers. In the region of Tamnava, north western Central Serbia, the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks. An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Glisic, published in 1875. In the story, men from Krnic and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a hail storm brought by alien vetrenjaks. They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them, their bodies turning black and blue from the blows. The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain, away from their fields. Serbian writer Janko Veselinovic was well acquainted with the folklore of Tamnava, where he worked as a teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co villager Petar, a vetrenjak As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that He told me. The pogibaoci from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.' A vetrenjak from the village of Trlic had reportedly claimed that he clashed with oxen and rams led by devils whose aim was to discharge hail over his village. Seeing hail clouds, people in Tamnava would shout, Keep your cattle out of our crops Thus they addressed hanged and drowned persons who were imagined to fly before the clouds and lead them. Farmers avoided leaving a harrow on the field, as they thought that the hail bringing devils could slam it on the head of the vetrenjak who defended the village. People behaved amicably toward vetrenjaks, but they warned their children to keep off from them, as these men had business with devils . In 2004, ethnographers interviewed elderly people in a group of hamlets south west of the town of Valjevo, who defined the vetrenjak as a man able to direct the movement of clouds. When such a man died, the wind would suddenly start to blow and clouds would loom. The term vetrenjak also designated a man who could fly invisible, which he usually did by night. He was born with a caul which was thrown away and eaten by birds. In the folklore of Serbs in the region of Syrmia, protection from hail was provided by the men called oblacars the name is derived from oblak cloud . The oblacar would rush directly beneath a dark cloud, as soon as it appeared above the fields of his village. There, he would run to and fro, waving his arms or holding a stick raised in the direction of the cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. In this way, the oblacar fought against a gigantic serpentine demon called azdaja, which was thought to fly accompanied by its retinue in low dark clouds, spewing hail from its broad muzzle. If the cloud moved away from his village without discharging hail, it meant that the oblacar had overpowered the azdaja and its retinue. An oblacar in the village of Mirkovci annually received wheat from his co villagers as a reward for his struggle. The men who defended their village from bad weather were referred to as dragons in eastern and southern Serbia, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia. In Serbia, they were also called zmajevit having a dragon's properties , from zmaj dragon . The mythological dragon was imagined as a fiery creature with wings, usually having a snake like shape he could also take the form of an eagle or a man. Each dragon had his own territory, within which he dwelt by a forest spring or stream, in the hollow trunk of a beech tree, or in a mountain cave. He was benevolent toward the humans, and he took care that his territory received the right amount of rain at the right time, for good growth of the crops. His arch enemy was a female demon named ala plural ale , whose main activity was to lead storm and hail clouds over fields to destroy crops. The ale also consumed the fertility of the fields. Whenever he noticed an ala approaching, the dragon would fly up into the clouds to fight against the demon and chase her away. He shot fiery arrows and stones at her, which produced lightning and thunder. In the regions where people believed in the zduhaci, the dragon was a highly regarded mythological being, but he was not associated with the crops and their protection from demons. Similar was the case in other than western regions of Bulgaria. The dragon man was believed to act similar to the mythological dragon as soon as he saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human. There is a story about a dragon man from the village of Pecenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me, before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, inadvertently grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, How tired I am This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds. In Banat and some areas of eastern Serbia, the dragon men were referred to as alovit. This adjective is derived from the noun ala, and means having supernatural or demonic properties . It could be applied not only to humans, but also to dragons, snakes, horses, trees, armies, and rivers. An ala could be seen as a good creature in some regions, such as Banat, Mount Kopaonik in south Serbia, and the adjacent Zupa basin with nearby areas, where she was believed to be connected to a territory, which she defended against attacks by the ale from other territories. This can be compared with the inter regional fights of the zduhaci. In villages of the Krusevac Municipality, when blessings were pronounced on Christmas Eve, the villagers would also say, God, save our guardian ala. People interpreted hail ravaging their crops as a defeat of their ala by an ala from elsewhere. The victorious ala would loot the crop yield of the ravaged area, and transfer it to her own territory. At the sight of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a neighbouring village. A man, who was thought to be alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone for as long as the bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovittheir souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds. At the village of Kusic in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was regarded to be alovit the villagers talked that he had a tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changedhe fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At the village of Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruza, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala. The dragon man was believed to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body. According to a belief, the power of dragon boys was greatest at the time of their birth the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Nis that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases. The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the Zupa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in Zupa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans. Prophet Elijah was also regarded as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, the prophet could summon dragon men. They would then fall asleep, and their souls would rush to the thundering clouds to assist the prophet against the ale. A legend in the region of Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun. Some animals could also be regarded as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster would go into the hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Nis, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon. The dragon was regarded as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Krusevo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away. Old Slavic mythology knew of men who were born out of relationships between women and dragons. These men were endowed with prodigious strength and exceptional abilities. They could turn into a dragon and fly, which they usually did in crisis situations, like battles. Two such heroes are recorded in the Serbian epic poetry Sekula Banovic and Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk Fiery Dragon Vuk . Both were late medieval nobles and warriors, to whom mythical attributes were attached in the poetry. Their transformation into a dragon is described in three ways the hero dresses his dragon shirt he spreads his hidden wings or he lets his soul out from his body in the form of a winged snake. The transformation may not be explicitly stated, but implied by a statement which indicates that the hero flies. Russian epic hero Volkh Vseslavevich is described as a son of a dragon in folk poems, he transforms into a falkon, aurochs, wolf, and some other animals. In a couple of Serbian and Bulgarian folk poems, Saint Nicholas suddenly falls asleep, and while he sleeps, he saves ships from a storm. In the popular tradition of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, the ability to leave one's own body was also possessed by some cunning women who practised magic for healing. A widespread custom of these women was to yawn repeatedly during healing rituals. This indicated the egress of their soul, which entered the sick person's body to chase away disease causing demonic entities. The rituals were accompanied by spells, in some of which the cunning women referred to their soul as a greyhound Run away, uroks, down gullies... The soul of Vida is a greyhoundshe overtakes the uroks and chokes them. An urok is a demonic entity, and Vida is the name of the cunning woman. The idea about the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been recorded in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit could turn into a bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, viscun in Dalmatia, and strigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Meimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories. A krsnik or kresnik was a man born with a caul, who could leave his body in spirit transformed into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak werewolves and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance of all sorts of agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The taltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the taltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision. In Greek folklore, a stikhio was a spirit that protected his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon man with enormous strength and the power to fly he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kucedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a solomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a solomonar named a vilva, who protected his village against attacks of vilvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat. It was believed in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named panetnik, chmurnik, or obocznik they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They were considered to be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, panetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The panetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds. Individuals who could leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudzauta among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, and they were called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzauta, mounted on animals or household objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, the land of the dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzauta would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31 July and 1 August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year. In the eastern Baltic region of Livonia, people designated as werewolves went underground in the shape of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow at the end of the world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood. In West Europe, medieval sources describe women who fell into trance on certain nights, abandoning their bodies in the form of an invisible spirit or animal. They then travelled to a gathering led by a female divinity who bestowed prosperity and knowledge. The divinity, semi bestial or attended by animals, was known by various regional names, such as Holda, Perchta, Madonna Oriente, Richella, Bensozia, Dame Habonde, and Fairy Queen in Scotland . She could be derived from Celtic goddesses like Epona, the Matres, and Artio. In Sicily, women and girls had nocturnal meetings in spirit with the so called Donni di fuora women from the outside , which could be traced back to the ancient ecstatic cult of the Mothers of Engyon, of Cretan origin. The armier were men from Ariege in the Pyrenees who could see and talk to the souls of the dead. The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a lethargy and travelled in spirit to the land of the dead, to communicate with them. The zduhaci, the dragon men, and the related folkloric figures of Europe can be compared with Eurasian shamans, e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, as well as the shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia. They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaci had to do was to fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy. There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist in the case of the zduhaci. However, the zduhaci who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey. Pavel Rovinski recorded the words he heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March Listen, how they singthe travellers they have gone high high Happy journey to them The crucial difference between the shamans and their European counterparts lies in the fact that the ecstasy of the former was public, while that of the latter was always private. Historian Carlo Ginzburg asserts that his divergence stands starkly against a homogeneous background. Ginzburg regards all of them as mediators with the realm of the dead, who are the ambiguous dispensers of prosperity the ecstasy represents a temporary death. The accounts in which the figures fly or fight materially rather than in spirit, are attempts to describe an ecstatic experience perceived as absolutely real . Ginzburg argues, adopting a diffusionist approach, that the shamanistic elements of the European folkloric figures have their original source in the shamanism of Siberian nomads, and their diffusion was possibly mediated by the Scythians. Another possibility is that the shamanistic beliefs are derived from a common source. Their nucleus could have developed in a remote past from cultural interactions between the Proto Indo Europeans, speakers of the Proto Uralic language, and ancient populations of the Caucasus. A third possibility is derivation from structural characteristics of the human mind. This is suggested by the persistence of the shamanistic phenomena over a long period, and their dispersion over a large area in culturally disparate societies. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive. In the novel Lelejska gora by Mihailo Lalic, set in Montenegro during the Second World War, there is a negative character, Kosto, nicknamed Zduvac a local variant of zduhac. Kosto is described as an elderly man of great strength. He says that when he lived in America the Italian Mafiosi called him Il Mago, magician or sorcerer , which he translates as zduvac. His Colt revolver is called Zduvac's Spouter because it always hits its target. Kosto is killed by the main character of the novel in a brutal fight. In a short story by Simo Matavulj, titled Zduhac , Matavulj acts as the companion and translator for a French vicomte who goes to hunt bears near a mountainous village in Old Herzegovina part of Montenegro . One of their escort is Micun, a burly young man from the village, who falls into a trance during a storm. The vicomte is given the explanation that Micun, being a zduhac, leaves his body to fight in the clouds against alien zduhaci. After an hour or two, the zduhac wakes up exhausted. Another man of the escort asks him, Was it good for us to which Micun answers affirmatively. The vicomte concludes the story by quoting Hamlet's well known lines about the secret things of heaven and earth Hamlet, 1.5.18889 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zduha%C4%87
"HMS Zealous was one of the three ships the others being HMS Royal Alfred and HMS Repulse forming the second group of wooden steam battleships selected in 1860 for conversion to ironclads. This was done in response to the perceived threat to Britain offered by the large French ironclad building programme. The ship was ordered to the West Coast of Canada after she was completed to represent British interests in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Zealous became the flagship for the Pacific Station for six years until she was relieved in 1872. She was refitted upon her arrival and subsequently became the guard ship at Southampton until she was paid off in 1875. The ship was in reserve until she was sold for scrap in 1886. HMS Zealous was given a straight stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form it had been found that lengthening the hull, as was done in the earlier Prince Consort class, led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable. Zealous was 252 feet 76.8 m long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 58 feet 7 inches 17.9 m . The ship had a draught of 25 feet 7.6 m forward and 25 feet 9 inches 7.8 m aft. She displaced 6,096 long tons 6,194 t . Zealous had a simple horizontal 2 cylinder horizontal return connecting rod steam engine driving a single four bladed, 19 foot 1 inch 5.8 m propeller. Steam was provided by eight rectangular boilers at a working pressure of 22 psi 152 kPa 2 kgf cm2 . The engine produced 3,623 indicated horsepower 2,702 kW during the ship's sea trials in November 1866 which gave the ship a maximum speed of 11.7 knots 21.7 km h 13.5 mph . Zealous carried a maximum of 660 long tons 670 t of coal. She was ship rigged with three masts and had a sail area of 29,200 square feet 2,710 m2 . Her best speed with the propeller disconnected and under sail alone was 10.5 knots 19.4 km h 12.1 mph . All of the available 9 inch 229 mm and 8 inch 203 mm guns had already been earmarked for other, more powerful ships. Zealous therefore received an armament of 7 inch 178 mm guns, which were deemed adequate for her expected service activity, and which, indeed, she retained for the whole of her active career. She was the only battleship ever to have a uniform armament of this calibre, and she, and her half sister HMS Repulse, were the only Victorian ironclads to retain their original armament unchanged through their entire active careers. Zealous was armed with twenty 7 inch rifled muzzle loading guns. Four of these guns were mounted on the upper deck as chase guns, two each fore and aft. The 16 calibre 7 inch gun weighed 6.5 long tons 6.6 t and fired a 112 pound 50.8 kg shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7.7 inch 196 mm armour. Zealous had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4.5 inches 114 mm thick amidships and tapered to 2.5 inches 64 mm thick at the bow and stern. From the level of the main deck, it reached 6 feet 1.8 m below the waterline. The guns on the main deck amidships were protected by a section of 4.5 inch armour, 103 feet 31.4 m long, with 4.5 inch transverse bulkheads at each end which left the chase guns unprotected. The armour was backed by the sides of the ship which consisted of 30.5 inches 770 mm of teak. The total weight of her armour was 790 long tons 800 t . HMS Zealous was laid down on 26 October 1859 as a wooden two deck, 90 gun ship of the line by Pembroke Royal Dockyard, but her construction was suspended pending experience with the conversion of her half sisters of the Prince Consort class to broadside ironclads. The Admiralty ordered on 2 July 1862 that she be cut down one deck and converted to an armoured frigate for the price of 239,258. The ship was launched on 7 March 1864 and commissioned in September 1866, but was not completed until 4 October 1866. In order to match the French deployment of armored corvettes of the Belliqueuse and Alma classes in the Pacific Ocean the Admiralty ordered Zealous to sail for the west coast of Canada shortly after she was completed. Upon her arrival the ship became the flagship, and reached her operational base at Esquimalt in July 1867 Esquimalt was the headquarters of the Pacific Station she remained moored there, at the end of a telegraph link with Britain, until April 1869. During this time her only sea service was for gunnery practice on two days every quarter. In January 1870 she picked up a fresh crew at Panama brought out by the two decker HMS Revenge. After six years on station she was relieved by Revenge as flagship and started for home. Her bottom had not been cleaned since she had left Great Britain and she could only make a maximum of 7 knots 13 km h 8.1 mph under sail or steam so her return voyage took five months. Zealous struck a rock while sailing through the English Narrows in the southwestern coast of Chile, but was only slightly damaged. She was refitted in Plymouth in April 1873 and then became guard ship at Southampton until 1875, when she was paid off. The ship was placed in reserve in Portsmouth until sold for scrap in September 1886. As coal was extremely expensive on the West Coast of the Americas, HMS Zealous generally used her sails and covered more miles under sail than any of the other Victorian sailing ironclads, and in her whole career never once travelled in company with another ironclad. She was also the first British ironclad to sail further from Britain than the Mediterranean.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Zealous%20%281864%29
"Typhoon Zeb, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Iliang, was a powerful typhoon that struck the island of Luzon in October 1998. The tenth tropical storm of the season, Zeb formed on October 10 from the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands. It moved westward initially and quickly intensified. Zeb's inflow briefly spawned another tropical storm, which it ultimately absorbed. Developing an eye, Zeb rapidly intensified into a super typhoon, officially reaching maximum sustained winds of 205 km h 125 mph one warning agency estimated winds as high as 285 km h 180 mph . After reaching peak intensity, the typhoon struck northern Luzon and quickly weakened over land. Turning to the north, Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan at a reduced intensity, and after accelerating to the northeast it moved through Japan. It became extratropical on October 18 and moved eastward over open waters. First affecting the Philippines, Zeb dropped torrential rainfall in Luzon, reaching 1,116 millimetres 43.9 inches in one day in La Trinidad, estimated as a one in 1,147 year event. The rains caused floods and landslides, which compounded with high winds to leave heavy crop damage. Zeb destroyed or damaged 85,844 houses in the Philippines, and damage in the country was estimated at 5.375 billion 1998 Philippine pesos, 126 million U.S. dollars , the fifth costliest at the time. There were also 83 deaths in the country, a number compounded upon when Typhoon Babs struck the same region a week later. High winds and rainfall from Zeb later affected Taiwan, causing NT 4.15 billion New Taiwan dollar, 125 million USD in damage as well as 31 deaths. Gusty winds affected much of Japan, while heavy rainfall peaked at 586 mm 23.1 in on Mount Ontake. The storm killed 14 people in the country, several related to landslides. Zeb destroyed 770 homes and flooded another 12,548 in Japan. The monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance over the western Pacific Ocean to the east of Guam around October 7. The system moved steadily westward, organizing enough for the American based Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early on October 9. After the disturbance passed south of Guam, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 18W late on October 9, and the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA followed suit the next day. While passing north of Yap in the Caroline Islands, the depression intensified into a tropical storm according to the JTWC, which gave it the name Zeb. The JMA again was delayed in upgrading by a day. After becoming a tropical storm, Zeb proceeded to steadily intensify. Its large inflow spawned a circulation well to the east northeast, which organized into a separate tropical storm Alex. Early on October 11, the storm entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA the Philippine based weather agency which gave it the local name Iliang. Late on October 11, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to typhoon status, or one minute winds of at least 120 km h 75 mph . This was based on the appearance of a banding type eye on satellite imagery. On October 12, the storm rapidly intensified as it turned more to the west northwest toward the Philippines. During this time, it caused increased wind shear over the smaller Tropical Storm Alex to the east northeast, ultimately absorbing it. At 00 00 UTC on October 13, the JTWC upgraded Zeb to super typhoon status, estimating winds of 260 km h 160 mph , marking that Zeb attained Category 5 status on the Saffir Simpson scale. Twelve hours later, the agency estimated that the typhoon strengthened further to a peak of 285 km h 180 mph , making it the strongest storm of the season. At the same time, PAGASA also estimated peak 10 minute winds of 240 km h 150 mph , also designating Zeb as a super typhoon. Late on October 13, the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 205 km h 127 mph just east of the island of Luzon. While near peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that winds of 185 km h 115 mph extended 95 kilometres 59 miles , and gales extended 465 km 289 mi from the center. Zeb's eyewall continued to contract up until it moved ashore. Early on October 14, Zeb made landfall on eastern Luzon just south of Palanan Bay, or east of Ilagan, near peak intensity. The typhoon weakened rapidly over land, while its track shifted more to the north around a ridge to the east. It emerged into the Luzon Strait between the eponymous island and Taiwan with a much larger eyewall, and failed to re intensify over open waters. Late on October 15, Zeb passed within 19 km 12 mi of Taiwan's east coast before accelerating to the northeast due to a passing trough. The JMA downgraded the typhoon to tropical storm status on October 16, although the JTWC retained Zeb at typhoon status. Favorable upper level conditions allowed the storm to briefly re intensify after passing Taiwan, although this was short lived, and it weakened while accelerating toward Japan. At 07 00 UTC on October 17, Zeb struck southern Kyushu in Kagoshima Prefecture. It continued northeastward through the country, striking Kochi Prefecture on Shikoku and later crossing central Honshu as a tropical storm. During this time, the storm was losing tropical characteristics as it swiftly entered the Sea of Japan. At 00 00 UTC on September 18, the JMA declared Zeb extratropical, and shortly after the storm moved over northern Hokkaido and into the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants moved across the southern Kamchatka Peninsula and continued eastward through the open north Pacific. It was last noted by the JMA early on October 20. Ahead of the storm, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal 4, in which winds of over 185 km h 115 mph were expected within 12 hours. The warning covered Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino, and northern Aurora. Lesser warnings were issued as far south as the Visayas, and extended into the Metro Manila area. After two damaging storms in September, the government began making widespread preparations on October 13, organizing efforts through its National Disaster Coordinating Council. Ports were closed and flights were canceled due to the storm. Before the worst of the storm struck, power companies shut off electricity to prevent accidents. About 103,000 people evacuated their homes, including over 6,325 staying in 114 government shelters. Evacuations extended as far south as Camarines Sur. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a stand by warning signal 1 due to the storm's proximity to the South China Sea. Before Zeb brushed the east coast of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, government buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted. 183 residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home. Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors. Similarly to Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan, and caused 271 domestic flights to be canceled. Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm. Striking the Philippines at peak intensity, Zeb largely affected the island of Luzon, including the regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, and Central Luzon. Wind gusts were estimated as high as 296 km h 184 mph in the country. The storm also dropped torrential rainfall, particularly in mountainous regions. In the municipality of Bakun, the 1,000 millimetre 39 inch rain gauge overflowed, and in nearby La Trinidad, the rainfall was 1,116 mm 43.9 in on October 14 alone. The latter total was estimated as a one in 1,147 year event, based on the history of local rainfall totals. In the city of Baguio, the precipitation reached 994.6 mm 39.16 in , enough to flood the town 9 m 30 ft deep. The Binga and Ambuclao dams in Benguet were unable to support the rains from the storm, forcing them to be opened and flood three towns in neighboring Pangasinan. Minor street flooding occurred along the west coast near Manila. Across Luzon, the high rains caused flooding, landslides, and halted construction of a dam in Bakun. Considered one of the strongest typhoons to hit the area in decades, Zeb knocked down tress and power lines, which covered roads and left areas isolated. The winds were strong enough to blow over a jeepney. Along its path, the storm destroyed 26,305 houses and damaged another 59,539, mostly affecting those of weaker building materials. River flooding caused heavy damage to crops, estimated at 1.76 billion 1998 Philippine pesos, 41.3 million U.S. dollars the storm destroyed 181,630 t 400,430,000 lb of rice in Ilocos Region and Cagayan Valley. Most of the damage occurred in Luzon, with little impact elsewhere. The storm also marred the local infrastructure areas in northeastern Luzon were isolated when landslides blocked a highway, and several other roads and bridges were impassible. Overall, Zeb killed 83 people in the country, while injuring another 63 most of the deaths were related to the landslides, and 33 of the deaths were in Cordillera Administrative Region. Overall damage was estimated at 5.375 billion PHP, 126 million USD , which as of 2011 was the thirteenth costliest typhoon in the Philippines and the fifth costliest at the time. The interaction between Zeb and the monsoon brought gusty winds to Hong Kong, reaching 88 km h 55 mph on Cheung Chau. High tides were also recorded, although there was no reported damage in the territory. Later, Zeb produced sustained winds of 155 km h 96 mph in Taiwan, although gusts topped at 191 km h 119 mph . The typhoon dropped torrential rainfall in the northern and eastern portions of the island, with peak hourly rates of 42.1 mm 1.66 in . Several regions of Taiwan received over 400 mm 16 in of rainfall. The rains caused severe flooding along rivers, with a peak discharge of 3715 m3 s 131,193 ft3 s . The high rainfall forced workers at the Fei tsui Dam to release water, after water levels rose by 300 mm 12 in . Landslides near Taipei wrecked homes, trapping at least two people. Landslides also covered several highways while floods washed away bridges, cutting off traffic. Flooding occurred in the suburbs of Taipei, and the winds were strong enough to cause skyscrapers to sway in the city. Zeb's winds knocked over trees, billboards, and power lines, leaving 1.15 million without electricity. Two story high waves killed a fisherman in Taitung City, washed a freighter ashore in Taichung, and capsized a boat in Tamsui District, killing one sailor five of the others on board swam two hours to reach shore. The storm left 57.6 million USD in crop damage, after hundreds of acres of fields were damaged in the southern and central Taiwan. Overall damage was estimated at NT 4.15 billion New Taiwan dollar, 125 million USD , and there were 31 confirmed deaths in Taiwan, with 19 people injured. While moving through Japan, Zeb produced peak sustained winds of 130 km h 81 mph in Kochi Prefecture within Shikoku. The highest rainfall was 586 mm 23.1 in on Mount Ontake on Honshu. The widespread rainfall caused 332 landslides and washed away seven bridges. Within Japan, Zeb first affected Miyako jima while passing about 180 km 110 mi to the northwest. High winds left 2,600 houses without power and caused damage to public buildings. It later passed about 230 km 140 mi to the northwest of Okinawa. Along the island, wind gusts reached 134 km h 83 mph , and wave heights peaked at 13.7 m 45 ft . The waves swept away two people over a sea wall, killing them both. High waves also damaged a port at Kadena Air Base as well as several houses near the coast. The storm also passed near the Yaeyama Islands with strong winds. Salt spray coated trees and ruined them, and there was scattered public building damage. On Kyushu, Zeb damaged houses, marred crops, and flooded rivers. The storm spawned a tornado in Miyazaki Prefecture that damaged two roofs and a vehicle. In Saganoseki, a motorist died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle in a nearby river. On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways. Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama. In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976. Landslides killed three people in Hiroshima Prefecture. Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields. A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard oil recovery equipment was sent to the area to clean the spill. Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152 buildings, and knocking 152,000 apples to the ground. Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770 homes and flooded another 12,548, with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. Overall, there were 14 deaths and 67 injuries, with damage estimated at 335.5 million 1998 USD . After the storm, then Philippine president Joseph Estrada declared six provinces as a state of calamity, which allocated 1 million in emergency funds for each province. The president was unable to return home from a trip to Singapore due to the storm. The military was activated to help organize relief efforts, using rubber boats and trucks to reach the hardest hit areas as floodwaters decreased. They were aided by the Philippine Red Cross and other government agencies. Most evacuees returned home after the storm passed, excluding those whose houses sustained damage. Volunteers, the military, and public workers helped clean up from the damage. Just seven days after Zeb's damaging Philippine landfall, another typhoonBabsstruck the same general region with a similar, but lesser intensity. After both storms, the Philippine National Electrification Administration provided 1.78 million to the Batanes Electric Cooperative to restore damaged power lines. Power was gradually restored in northeastern Luzon, allowing communication of the damage extent. The nation's Department of Health distributed 547,469 worth of medicine to four provinces. The government airlifted about 3,000 bags of supplies to Cagayan that included rice and canned goods. The back to back storm impacts caused an estimated 30 drop in coconut exports. Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400 , after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived. By December 1998, consumer prices had risen by 11.2 over the previous year due to the typhoons' damage. Workers in Taiwan began a search and rescue mission for missing victims once the typhoon warning was lifted. Workers immediately began repairing road damage in Japan once the storm passed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon%20Zeb
"The Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi , also known as the imperial zebra, is the largest living wild equid and the largest and most threatened of the three species of zebra, the other two being the plains zebra and the mountain zebra. Named after Jules Grevy, it is found in Kenya and Ethiopia. Compared with other zebras, it is tall, has large ears, and its stripes are narrower. The Grevy's zebra lives in semi arid grasslands where it feeds on grasses, legumes, and browse it can survive up to five days without water. It differs from the other zebra species in that it does not live in harems and has few long lasting social bonds. Male territoriality and motherfoal relationships form the basis of the social system of the Grevy's zebra. This zebra is considered to be endangered. Its population has declined from 15,000 to 3,000 since the 1970s. However, as of 2008, the population is stable. The Grevy's zebra was first described by French naturalist Emile Oustalet in 1882. He named it after Jules Grevy, then president of France, who, in the 1880s, was given one by the government of Abyssinia. Traditionally, this species was classified in the subgenus Dolichohippus with plains zebra and mountain zebra in Hippotigris. Groves and Bell 2004 place all three species in the subgenus Hippotigris. Fossils of zebra like equids have been found throughout Africa and Asia in the Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits. Notable examples include E. sanmeniensis from China, E. cautleyi from India, E. valeriani from central Asia and E. oldowayensis from East Africa. The latter, in particular is very similar to the Grevy's zebra and may have been its ancestor. The modern Grevy's zebra arose in the early Pleistocene. Zebras appear to be a monophyletic lineage and recent 2013 phylogenies have placed Grevy's zebra in a sister taxon with the plains zebra. In areas where Grevy's zebras are sympatric with plains zebras, the two may gather in same herds and fertile hybrids do occur. The Grevy's zebra is the largest of all wild equines. It is 2.52.75 m 8.29.0 ft from head to tail with a 5575 cm 2230 in tail, and stands 1.451.6 m 4.85.2 ft high at the withers. These zebras weigh 350450 kg 770990 lb . Grevy's zebra differs from the other two zebras in its more primitive characteristics. 147 It is particularly mule like in appearance the head is large, long, and narrow with elongated nostril openings 147 the ears are very large, rounded, and conical and the neck is short but thick. The zebra's muzzle is ash grey to black in colour with the lips having whiskers. The mane is tall and erect juveniles have a mane that extends to the length of the back and shortens as they reach adulthood. As with all zebra species, the Grevy's zebra's pelage has a black and white striping pattern. The stripes are narrow and close set, being broader on the neck, and they extend to the hooves. The belly and the area around the base of the tail lack stripes and are just white in color, which is unique to the Grevy's zebra. Due to the stripes being closer together and thinner than most of the other zebras, it is easier for them to make a good escape and to hide from predators. Foals are born with brown and white striping, with the brown stripes darkening as they grow older. Embryological evidence has shown that the zebra's background colour is dark and the white is an addition. The stripes of the zebra may serve to make it look bigger than it actually is or disrupt its outline. It appears that a stationary zebra can be inconspicuous at night or in shade. Experiments have suggested that the stripes polarize light in such a way that it discourages biting horse flies in a manner not shown with other coat patterns. Other studies suggest that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barber pole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. The Grevys zebra largely inhabits northern Kenya, with some isolated populations in Ethiopia. 147 It was extirpated from Somalia and Djibouti and its status in South Sudan is uncertain. It lives in Acacia Commiphora bushlands and barren plains. Ecologically, this species is intermediate between the arid living African wild ass and the water dependent plains zebra. 147 Lactating females and non territorial males use areas with green, short grass and medium, dense bush more often than non lactating females and territorial males. Grevy's zebras rely on grasses, legumes, and browse for nutrition. They commonly browse when grasses are not plentiful. Their hindgut fermentation digestive system allows them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for ruminant herbivores. Grevy's zebras can survive up to a week without water, but will drink daily when it is plentiful. They often migrate to better watered highlands during the dry season. Females require significantly more water when they are lactating. During droughts, the zebras will dig water holes and defend them. The grevy's zebras main predator is the lion, but adults can be hunted by spotted hyenas. African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards almost never attack adults, even in desperate times, but sometimes prey on young animals, although females are fiercely protective of their young. In addition, they are susceptible to various gastro intestinal parasites, notably of the genus Trichostrongylus. Adult males mostly live in territories during the wet seasons but some may stay in them year round if there's enough water left. Stallions that are unable to establish territories are free ranging 151 and are known as bachelors. Females, young and non territorial males wander through large home ranges. The females will wander from territory to territory preferring the ones with the highest quality food and water sources. Up to nine males may compete for a female outside of a territory. Territorial stallions will tolerate other stallions who wander in their territory, however when an oestrous female is present the territorial stallion keeps other males at bay. 151 Non territorial males may avoid territorial ones because of harassment. When females are not around, a territorial stallion will seek the company of other stallions. The stallion shows his dominance with an arched neck and a high stepping gait and the least dominant stallions submit by extending their tail, lowering their heads and nuzzling their superior's chest or groin. 151 Zebras produce numerous sounds and vocalisations, when alarmed, they produce deep hoarse grunts. Whistling and squealing are made when alarmed, during fights, or when scared or in pain. Snorting may be produced when scared or as a warning. A male will bray in defense of its territory, when driving females, or keeping other males at bay. Barking may be made during copulation and distressed foals will squeal. The call of the Grevy's zebra has been described as something like a hippo's grunt combined with a donkey's wheeze . To get rid of flies or parasites, they roll in dust, water or mud or, in the case of flies, twitch their skin. They also rub against trees, rocks and other objects to get rid of irritations like itchy skin, hair or parasites. Although Grevy's zebras do not perform mutual grooming, they do sometimes rub against a conspecific. Grevy's zebras can mate and give birth year round, but most mating takes place in the early rainy seasons and births mostly take place in August or September after the long rains. An oestrous mare may visit though as many as four territories a day and will mate with the stallions in them. Among territorial stallions, the most dominant ones control territories near water sources, which mostly attract mares with dependant foals, while more subordinate stallions control territories away from water with greater amounts of vegetation, which mostly attract mares without dependant foals. The resident stallions of territories will try to subdue the entering mares with dominance rituals and then continue with courtship and copulation. Grevy's zebra stallions have large testicles and can ejaculate a large amount of semen to replace the sperm of other males. This is a useful adaptation for a species whose females mate polyandrously. Bachelors or outside territorial stallions sometimes sneak copulation of mares in another stallions territory. While female associations with individual males are brief and mating is promiscuous, females who have just given birth will reside with one male for long periods and mate exclusively with that male. Lactating females are harassed by males more often than non lactating ones and thus associating with one male and his territory provides an advantage as he will guard against other males. Gestation of the Grevy's zebra normally lasts 390 days, with a single foal being born. A newborn zebra will follow anything that moves, so new mothers prevent other mares from approaching their foals while imprinting their own striping pattern, scent and vocalisation on them. Females with young foals may gather into small groups. Mares may leave their foals in kindergartens while searching for water. The foals will not hide, so they can be vulnerable to predators. However, kindergartens tend to be protected by an adult, usually a territorial male. A female with a foal stays with one dominant territorial male who has exclusive mating rights to her. While the foal will not likely be his, the stallion will look after it to ensure that the female stays in his territory. To adapt to a semi arid environment, Grevy's zebra foals have longer nursing intervals and wait until they are three months old before they start drinking water. Although offspring become less dependant on their mothers after half a year, associations with them continue for up to three years. The Grevy's zebra was known to the Europeans in antiquity and was used by the Romans in circuses. It was subsequently forgotten in the Western world for a thousand years. In the seventeenth century, the king of Shoa now central Ethiopia exported two zebras one to the Sultan of Turkey and another to the Dutch governor of Jakarta. A century later, in 1882, the government of Abyssinia sent one to French president Jules Grevy. It was at that time that the animal was recognised as its own species and named in Grevys honour. The Grevy's zebra is considered endangered. Its population was estimated to be 15,000 in the 1970s and by the early 21st century the population was lower than 3,500, a 75 decline. 11 It is estimated that there are less than 2,500 Grevy's zebras still living in the wild. There are also an estimated 600 Grevy's zebras in captivity. 20 Captive herds have been known to thrive, like at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, United States, where more than 70 foals have been born. There, research is underway in partnership with the Conservation Centers for Species Survival on semen collection and freezing and on artificial insemination. The Grevy's zebra population trend is considered stable as of 2008. The Grevy's zebra is legally protected in Ethiopia. In Kenya, it is protected by the hunting ban of 1977. In the past, Grevy's zebras were threatened mainly by hunting for their skins which fetched a high price on the world market. However, hunting has declined and the main threat to the zebra is habitat loss and competition with livestock. Cattle gather around watering holes and the Grevy's zebras are fenced from those areas. 17 Community based conservation efforts have shown to be the most effective in preserving Grevy's zebras and their habitat. Less than 0.5 of the range of the Grevy's zebra is in protected areas. In Ethiopia, the protected areas include Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve, Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary, Borana Controlled Hunting Area and Chelbi Sanctuary. In Kenya, important protected areas include the Buffalo Springs, Samburu and Shaba National Reserves and the private and community land wildlife conservancies in Isiolo, Samburu and the Laikipia Plateau. The mesquite plant was introduced into Ethiopia around 1997 and is endangering the zebra's food supply. An invasive species, it is replacing the two grass species, Cenchrus ciliaris and Chrysopogon plumulosus, which the zebras eat for most of their food.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9vy%27s%20zebra
"Zebras is the twenty second episode and season finale of the tenth season of the police procedural television series Law Order Special Victims Unit, and the show's 224th episode overall. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company NBC in the United States on June 2, 2009. In the episode, an open and shut case against a mentally disturbed murderer, played by Nick Stahl, is blown when a forensics technician makes a technical error. As Elliot and Olivia investigate additional murders believed to be the work of the same killer, they uncover a plot within their own department. The episode was written by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly, and directed by Peter Leto. It was the final appearance of Mike Doyle, who had played forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran since 2003 and appeared on the show more than 50 times the character was killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey Noel Fisher as part of a surprise twist conceived by executive producer and showrunner Neal Baer. Zebras also included guest appearances by Kelly Bishop, Judith Light and Carol Kane as Gwen Munch, the conspiracy theorist ex wife of Detective John Munch Kane had previously played the same role opposite actor Richard Belzer in a 1997 episode of Homicide Life on the Street. According to Nielsen ratings, Zebras was watched by 11.34 million viewers, making it the highest rated show of the night and the series' most watched episode in more than a year. The episode received higher ratings than Inside the Obama White House, a one hour special documenting one day in the White House of U.S. President Barack Obama, which aired earlier in the evening on NBC and was seen by 9.1 million viewers. A father and daughter rollerblading in Central Park stumble across the body of a woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch Richard Belzer and Fin Ice T learn Peter Harrison Nick Stahl , who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb around the time of the murder. Stabler Christopher Meloni and Benson Mariska Hargitay question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer Kelly Bishop , stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran Mike Doyle confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open and shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey Noel Fisher in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly Judith Light is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey. Shortly afterward, another woman is found murdered at Coney Island in a similar manner Stuckey finds a soda can with a bloody fingerprint on it, later confirmed to be Harrison's. The police learn Harrison disclosed his hiding place to a friend on a conspiracy theorist website Munch recognizes the friend as his ex wife Gwen Carol Kane , whom he convinces to reveal Harrison's location. After Harrison evades capture, Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer, who said she has been taking care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child. An unstable Harrison visits Zimmer, who calls Stabler and Benson to arrest him. As they are about to return to the precinct, Zimmer gets locked into her car and a poisonous gas is released into the air Stabler breaks her car window, but is unable to save her in time. Later, Judge Donnelly is nearly killed when she sits on a needle filled with potassium chloride at her home she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer as he or she was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates. Zebras was written by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly, and directed by Peter Leto. The surprise twist in the episode, in which forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey, was conceived by Neal Baer, the series executive producer and showrunner. Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story just came to one day and thought that this may be a really interesting way to bring cast together and deal with this story point . In particular, Baer said he wanted to kill a long recurring character so the show could explore characters' reactions to a death in an interesting way . Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call a few weeks before the episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, I think everybody knew that somebody was going, so they weren't shocked. During a May 2009 interview, Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending One of our own is murdered. Zebras was the final episode for Doyle, who had been a recurring character since 2003 and had made more than 50 appearances on the show. The episode also marked the seventh on screen death for the actor, who had been killed in several films and television episodes, including on the HBO series Oz. Christopher Meloni, who also appeared on Oz, comforted Doyle about his character's death by saying, At least you're not getting gang raped , a reference to Doyle's death scene from that show. The climax scene of Zebras , in which Dale Stuckey threatens Elliot Stabler as Olivia Benson tries to talk him down, was filmed on May 7, 2009, in a warehouse in North Bergen, New Jersey. A crew member shouted dead man walking to Doyle as he arrived on the set. The knife protruding from Doyle was staged by strapping to his chest a metal plate with a center slot holding the retractable blade of the fake knife. Carol Kane played Gwen Munch, Detective John Munch's conspiracy theorist ex wife. Kane played the same part alongside actor Richard Belzer in 1997 on the series Homicide Life on the Street, which also starred Belzer as John Munch. The episode was watched by 11.3 million viewers, making it the highest rated show of the night. It was the most watched episode of Law Order Special Victims Unit in more than a year, and was about two million viewers over its season average. It captured more viewers than the first one hour episode of Inside the Obama White House, NBC's two part special documenting one day in the White House of U.S. President Barack Obama the show, which aired at 9 p.m., one hour before Zebras , was seen by 9.1 million viewers, the most of its time slot. The two shows made NBC, which had been experiencing poor ratings in recent years, the highest watched network for the fourth night in a row. Zebras received a 3.5 rating 9 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, and a 2.6 rating 8 share among viewers between 18 and 34. E writer Joel Ryan, however, noted that Law Order Special Victims Unit had little competition other than re runs because it aired during the summer season. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called the death of O'Halloran and the twist involving Stuckey very welcome, because they added a fresh element of uncertainty to a show that can be predictable . Tucker also praised the return of Kelly Bishop as an attorney. In writing of the episode, Nick Zaino of TV Squad said Overall, a well paced, well written episode, and a whole lot of creepy fun , and said the scenes with Kane and Belzer were laugh out loud funny .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebras%20%28Law%20%26%20Order%3A%20Special%20Victims%20Unit%29
"Tropical Storm Zeke was the final named storm of the record breaking 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Forming out of a tropical wave on October 25, Zeke began as a disorganized depression. Tracking west northwestward, the system gradually developed organized convection and intensified into a tropical storm. However, it soon entered a high wind shear environment, causing Zeke to weaken to a tropical depression. The following day, the storm re intensified despite unfavorable conditions and later attained peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h on October 29. Rapid weakening followed shortly thereafter as convection dissipated and the center became exposed. During the afternoon of October 30, Zeke degenerated into a remnant low pressure system and dissipated several days later several hundred miles south of Baja California Sur. On October 29, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for portions of the Mexican coastline however, these were canceled the following day due to the storm's rapid weakening. Although the storm did not move over land, its outer bands brought locally heavy rain and gusty winds to Sinaloa and Jalisco. Tropical Storm Zeke originated from a tropical wave that was first identified off the west coast of Africa on October 6, 1992. Initially, well organized convection was associated with the system as it tracked westward however, once over the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity diminished. Between October 21 and 23, the poorly defined wave moved across Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean. Over the following few days, convection gradually increased and the system became better organized. On October 25, the National Hurricane Center NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Twenty Seven E, at which time the storm was situated roughly 805 mi 1,295 km south of the southern tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Upon being classified, the depression was relatively disorganized, but deep convection had maintained itself near the center of circulation. Throughout October 25, banding features developed and the upper level outflow became better established. In response to a ridge to the east, the depression tracked in a general west northwest direction. Intensification was likely as the system was forecast to remain within an environment characterized by low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeke, the record breaking twenty fourth named storm of the year. Within several hours of being upgraded, Zeke began to degrade for unknown reasons, with convection lessening around the center. Increasing westerly wind shear, associated with a mid to upper level trough approaching the west coast of the United States, later caused the system to weaken further however, Zeke managed to maintain tropical storm intensity until the morning of October 27. As Zeke continued to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began to turn towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October 27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed the passage of a shortwave trough however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and began to turn towards the northeast. Late on October 29, a large burst of deep convection over the center of the storm allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph 85 km h with a barometric pressure of 1000 mbar hPa 29.53 inHg . Not long after attaining its peak intensity, Zeke began to weaken once more due to increasing westerly wind shear. By the early morning of October 30, the center of circulation became devoid of thunderstorm activity and the system had turned eastward. Later that day, Zeke weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low pressure system. The NHC continued to monitor the low level swirl of clouds associated with Zeke for several more days as the system meandered several hundred miles south of Baja California Sur. On October 29, the forecast track for Zeke produced by the National Hurricane Center indicated that the storm would skirt Baja California before striking the western coast of Mexico as a tropical depression. In response to this, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between Cabo San Lazaro and Los Burros. Additionally, a tropical storm watch was raised for areas along mainland Mexico between Los Mochis, Sinaloa and Puerto Vallarta. Roughly 24 hours after these advisories were issued, they were canceled as Zeke rapidly dissipated over open waters. Although the center of the storm never moved over land, the system's outer bands brought locally heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of Sinaloa and Jalisco. When the National Hurricane Center upgraded Tropical Depression Twenty Seven E to Tropical Storm Zeke on October 25, it marked the first time that a storm name beginning with the letter Z was used on record in the basin. Zeke also continued to further the record of named storms in a single season in the eastern Pacific, being the 24th tropical storm.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Zeke%20%281992%29
"Severe Tropical Storm Zelda was the last storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season. A disturbance formed near the International Date Line, and strengthened into a tropical depression on November 27. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity, thus naming it Zelda. The storm quickly strengthened into a Category 1 typhoon on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale near the Marshall Islands on November 29. It reached peak of 110 km h 70 mph , with a barometric pressure of 975 mbar 28.8 inHg . The tropical storm traveled northwestward, and later northeastward. Zelda soon weakened into a tropical storm, and then a tropical depression. The JTWC discontinued warnings on December 4, while the Japanese Meteorological Agency JMA continued to track the storm until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7. Zelda caused significant damage to the Marshall Islands. Operations at Kwajalein Missile Range were disrupted severely. About 60 percent of homes were destroyed in Ebeye, leaving 6,000 people without residence. Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt. No deaths or injuries were reported. Later in December, President George H. W. Bush declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA to assist. The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries. In late November, a circulation was generated near the International Date Line by westerly winds. It was included in the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory at 0600 UTC on November 25. Vertical wind shear prevented strengthening at first, but the disturbance later continued to develop. A tropical cyclone formation alert soon followed from the JTWC. JMA started tracking the disturbance at 0600 UTC on November 27, and JTWC issued their first warning 18 hours later on the depression, naming it 31W. The depression quickly intensified, and it became a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on November 28 for JTWC, with winds of 65 km h 40 mph . Operationally, the storm was upgraded twenty four hours later, after Kwajalein received stronger winds than expected. JMA upgraded the storm at 0300 UTC on November 29. The tropical storm received the name Zelda. JMA upgraded Zelda to a severe tropical storm eighteen hours later. Zelda rapidly intensified into a Category 1 typhoon on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale at 1200 UTC of November 29, with winds of 120 km h 75 mph , near the Marshall Islands. At that time, JMA kept it as a tropical storm with winds of 80 km h 50 mph , with a pressure reading of 990 mbar 29 inHg . JMA estimated Zelda has reached peak around 0600 UTC on November 30 at 110 km h 70 mph , with a barometric pressure of 975 mbar 28.8 inHg . Six hours later, JTWC reported the storm has reached the peak of 145 km h 90 mph , west of Enewetak. Later, a trough created by Typhoon Yuri caused the subtropical ridge to weaken, allowing Zelda to move northward. By December 1, the storm began to weaken and turned northeast. On December 2, JMA reported the storm had weaken to 100 km h 60 mph , and JTWC weakened it to 130 km h 80 mph . The storm weakened below Category 1 typhoon strength on 1800 UTC of the same day, with winds of 110 km h 70 mph . Upper level winds soon increased, and Zelda's central convection became sheared. JMA downgraded Zelda to a tropical storm on December 3, and to a tropical depression later that day. A few hours later, JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, as it turned slightly northwestward, something they did not expect. The circulation detached from the frontal cloud line, and JTWC issued the last warning of the year. The depression turned back northeastward, and JMA stopped tracking just past the International Date Line on December 7. The storm affected Marshall Islands around November 28, producing winds as high as 160 km h 100 mph . The storm impacted islands of Kwajalein, Majuro, Lae, Wotho, and Eniwetok. Kwajalein Missile Range caught stronger winds than expected from the storm, and operations in the missile range were affected severely. Zelda also produced a pressure of 990.1 hPa 29.24 inHg , which was the lowest pressure ever recorded on Kwajalein. Later, In Ebeye, 60 percent of homes were destroyed, and 6,000 people were left homeless. Food and water supplies were contaminated from salt in surge waves, and the water desalination plant became inoperable. Fresh water production records since 1989 were lost during the storm. The local hospital was still intact, but a few power lines were cut. There were no deaths or significant injuries. Other islands in the nation had their water contaminated by saltwater, and 95 percent of the crops were destroyed by the storm surge. Coral reefs were also damaged when the storm came nearby. The U.S. Army engaged in cleanup and repairing in the country. On December 6, the 834th Airlift Division sent six C 130s to Kwajalein with supplies. On the same day, President George H. W. Bush declared a major disaster, allowing federal funding to be sent to Arno, Aur, Kwajalein, Lae, Lib, Namu and Ujae islands. Despite already getting funding from the United States, Marshall Islands requested for aid via United Nations Disaster Relief Organization UNDRO on December 18. By March 26, 1992, about 98,000 1991 USD worth of relief goods were sent to the Marshall Islands, from UNDRO, United Nations Development Programme UNDP , and Australia. FEMA sent 1.518 million 1991 USD to affected families.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Zelda%20%281991%29
"Zelda II The Adventure of Link is an action role playing video game with platforming elements. The second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System on January 14, 1987, less than a year after the original The Legend of Zelda was released and seven months before North America saw the release of the first Zelda title. The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1988, almost two years after its initial release in Japan. The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, again involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who has fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side scrolling and role playing elements was a significant departure from its predecessor. For much of the series' three decade history, the game served as the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series were either prequels or occurred in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline. This eventually changed with the release of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild in 2017, which serves as the latest chapter in the overall continuity. The game was a critical and financial success, and introduced elements such as Link's magic meter and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role playing elements, such as experience points, and the platform style side scrolling and limited lives have not been used since in canonical games. The Adventure of Link was followed by The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Zelda II The Adventure of Link is an action role playing game, bearing little resemblance to the first or later entries in The Legend of Zelda series. The Adventure of Link features side scrolling areas within a larger top down world map, rather than the mostly top down perspective of the previous title, which only used side scrolling in a few dungeon basement areas. The side scrolling gameplay and experience system are similar to features of the Castlevania series, especially Castlevania II Simon's Quest. The game incorporates a strategic combat system, a proximity continue system based on lives, an experience points system, magic spells, and more interaction with non player characters. Apart from the non canonical CD i The Legend of Zelda games, Link The Faces of Evil and Zelda The Wand of Gamelon, no other game in the series includes a life feature. The side angle was used again in Link's Awakening and the other Game Boy entries, but was not the main angle in those games, which relied primarily on the top down view. In this installment, Link gains experience points to upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. He can raise each of these attributes to a maximum of eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero. The Adventure of Link plays out in a two mode dynamic. The overworld, the area where the majority of the action occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games, is still from a top down perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side scrolling view. This mode is where most of the action takes place, and, with the exception of traveling across lava and water, it is the only mode in which Link can take damage and be killed. Link also enters this mode when attacked by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, there are three types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health. This separate method of traveling and entering combat is one of many aspects adapted from the role playing genre. Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map will automatically switch the game to a side scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup. The Adventure of Link has a more complex combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must alternate between standing and crouching positions to attack enemies and defend himself for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until he has a chance to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for midair downward and upward stabs. Though Link must still collect several items in order to progress in the game as in the previous and subsequent installments of the series , these special items grant abilities which either remain in permanent use for the rest of the game or can only be activated in the overworld. In place of actively used items, The Adventure of Link features eight magic spells for Link to use during action scenes. Each spell is learned from a different wise man in one of the eight towns within Hyrule. Link often has to complete side quests, such as retrieving lost items, before they will teach him their spells. Some spells and items are necessary for advancing in the game. Also, the Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes, since healing Fairies are only found in rare fixed spots and only appear randomly as overworld encounters. Like its predecessor, The Adventure of Link allows storing up to three games in the cartridge's memory. Once the game has been completed, selecting the corresponding file in the main menu allows starting a new game preserving the acquired experience levels, techniques, and magic spells but no special items, Heart and Magic containers, or extra lives, which must be obtained again . Several years after the events of The Legend of Zelda, the now 16 year old Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand, exactly like the crest of Hyrule. He seeks out Impa, who takes him to the North Castle, where a door has been magically sealed for generations. Impa places the back of Link's left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden. Impa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda not the Zelda from the first game , the princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the Legend of Zelda . Zelda's brother tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the Triforce. Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the prince's wizard friend, in anger, tried to strike her down with a spell. Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it. The prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, hoping she would one day be awakened. He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy. Impa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, Ganon's followers seek to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganons ashes will bring Ganon back to life. Ultimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces and enters the Great Palace. After venturing deep inside, Link battles a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by his shadowy doppelganger Dark Link. Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda. The game ends as they presumably kiss under a falling curtain. Shigeru Miyamoto, the co creator of the original The Legend of Zelda, intended to make Zelda II The Adventure of Link fundamentally different from its predecessor. A separate team from the first installment's was assembled to develop the sequel. However, Miyamoto who was credited under the pseudonym Miyahon was still involved as the producer, and Takashi Tezuka returned to write the story and script. Zelda II The Adventure of Link had two directors for director Tadashi Sugiyama credited under the pseudonym Sugiyan , it was the first major project at Nintendo. The game's other director, Yasuhisa Yamamura, was credited under his nickname Yamahen . Rather than Koji Kondo composing the sequel, Akito Nakatsuka credited as Tsukasan created the music. The Adventure of Link was originally released on the Family Computer Disk System FDS before its worldwide release. Like its predecessor, the FDS version appears to be an earlier version of the game, with a few obvious differences. In the English release, the dungeons each have different colors, whereas in the FDS version they are all gray. Also, the two dungeon bosses Carrok and Volvagia the latter being initially named Barba in the NES release have different graphical appearances. The game over screen in the English version features the silhouette of Ganon from the chest up, with the text saying Game Over Return of Ganon , whereas the FDS game over screen is a plain black screen with the text saying Return of Ganon The End . There are some slight additions to the dungeons, as well as a handful of differences on the dungeons themselves. Due to an additional sound chip that the Disk System has, when Nintendo ported Zelda II over to the NES, they had to eliminate some musical elements, especially from the title screen. On the main map, the icons denoting attacking monsters look different, but the most significant change is the spending of experience points, as Link's three attributes cost the same, unlike the worldwide release. Further, the game is designed to promote balanced leveling, as the saved game on the disk will only let the levels for the attributes go as high as whatever is set the lowest e.g. if Life is at 5 and Strength is at 4, but Magic is at 1, then the saved game will reflect all as level 1 , while still saving the data regarding crystals that have been placed and items that have been collected. These differences make leveling up in the game very different. The Adventure of Link was re released in 2003 on The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition disc for the GameCube, and again in 2004 as part of the Classic NES Series for Game Boy Advance, with minor changes. The intro text was changed to read third Triforce rather than No.3 Triforce and the copyright date was altered to read 19872004 Nintendo . The death animation removed flashing colors in an effort to prevent seizures, replacing it with a solid red color. There were also various graphical and audio tweaks. It was released as the 100th title on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia on February 9, 2007, and was released in North America on June 4, 2007. The text changes were not made in this version, but it does feature the solid red color in the death animations from the GameCube and Game Boy Advance versions. The Adventure of Link was re released again on the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console in September 2011, alongside the first Legend of Zelda game, as part of the 3DS Ambassadors program. It was one of ten NES games for owners who purchased their 3DS consoles before the price drop. It was later made available for all 3DS owners in Japan on June 6, 2012, in Europe on September 13, and in North America on November 22. The game was also re released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in September 2013. The Adventure of Link was also included as one of the 30 built in games within the NES Classic Edition, a miniature replica of the Nintendo Entertainment System, released on November 10, 2016 in Australia and Japan, and a day later in North America and Europe. Upon its release in North America, Zelda II became one of the most popular NES games of 1988, with many retailers reporting that the game was selling out that year. The game ultimately sold 4.38 million copies worldwide. In 1987, Famicom Tsushin now Famitsu gave it a score of 36 out of 40, based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 8, 10, 9 and 9 out of 10. This made it their second highest rated game of 1987, behind only Dragon Quest II. These were also the only two games to have received a Famitsu score of 35 40 or above up until 1987. Play magazine praised the unique gameplay, saying that it's this combination of unique elements that creates an action RPG experience unlike any other . Nintendo Power said that the game was an entertaining and natural step in the franchise's evolution, and awarded it their Game of the Year Award for 1988. Zelda II was reviewed in 1992 by issue 2 of Total magazine, where it received an 82 rating, due in great part to mediocre sub scores for music and graphics. A 1993 review of the game was printed in issue 198 of Dragon by Sandy Petersen, in the Eye of the Monitor column. Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Zelda II was rated the 110th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list. In August 2008, Nintendo Power listed it as the 12th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as a radical and refreshing departure from its predecessor. IGN said that the game is a recommended and playable adventure but also said, don't expect the same gameplay from the truly classic Zelda titles. 1UP.com praised the game's length, citing that you can certainly find plenty here to keep you busy for some time. Kotaku enjoyed the darker spin on the original Zelda, stating the more detailed graphics and bigger sprites made the enemies appear more menacing and hostile. The evolved combat system meant that enemies could defend themselves, withdraw, or strike strategically, using the environment to their advantage. The game also received some criticism. GameSpot said that while the game is decent enough to make it worth the 5 price on the Wii's Virtual Console , it features questionable design decision and can get confusing if players don't have the help of walkthroughs. The GBA version of the game had an aggregated score of 73 on Metacritic. and an aggregated score of 68.88 on GameRankings, making it the game of the series with the lowest score in both websites. Many elements first introduced in this game have remained in the series. For instance, non player characters NPCs were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II was also one of the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in Ocarina of Time, a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in Four Swords Adventures, and yet another appears in Spirit Tracks, as well as in A Link Between Worlds. Additionally, The Adventure of Link was one of the first games to combine role playing video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree. Over the next few years, a number of Japanese made games appeared with a similar format major titles such as Cadash 1989 closely resemble The Adventure of Link, with side scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth. Most of the sages in Ocarina of Time bear the same names as towns from The Adventure of Link Rauru, Ruto, Saria, Nabooru, and Darunia excluding Impa . Another town, Mido, is also the name of a character in Kokiri Forest. However, in the in game chronology, the towns were named after the characters. The Adventure of Link is also the only Zelda game of the main English releases not to use The Legend of Zelda in its title, the only Zelda game to feature lives counting down, and therefore the only game in the series to include 1 up dolls. The next Zelda game released after The Adventure of Link was The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for the Super Famicom in 1991, which follows new Link and Zelda characters and returns to the top down style of the original. There are a small number of side scrolling areas in The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening these areas were mainly tunnels and caves. The series broke away from the top down style again in 1998 when Ocarina of Time was released on the Nintendo 64, with 3D graphics. A new version of the composition Temple , arranged by Shogo Sakai, is featured in Super Smash Bros. Melee, where it is played during the Hyrule Temple stage and the Underground Maze level. A variation of the track, as well as a new version of the Great Palace level song, also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The track was later once again updated and appeared twice, as the StreetPass Battle Theme as well as a slower version for the Battle Victory music, in the Nintendo 3DS game A Link Between Worlds, making it the only subsequent Zelda game to include theme music that originated in The Adventure of Link. The StreetPass battle mode is itself inspired by the final boss fight of Zelda II StreetPass fights occur between one player as Link and the other player as Shadow Dark Link. Zelda II was also very influential to other NES games like Faxanadu, Moon Crystal and The Battle of Olympus. Moreover, the Adventure Time Hey Ice King Why'd You Steal Our Garbage title, developed by WayForward Technologies, was intended to play like Zelda II and pays homage to it. It features very similar gameplay and references to the Zelda series.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%20II%3A%20The%20Adventure%20of%20Link
"Dr. Radek Zelenka is a fictional character of a scientist in the television series Stargate Atlantis, portrayed by David Nykl. He is a member of the original expedition from Earth to the Ancient city of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy, which he joined after turning down a job at Masaryk University in his home country Czech Republic. His expertise on Ancient technology is only surpassed by Dr. Rodney McKay, with whom he shares a friendly rivalry. Zelenka's planned one time appearance in the season 1 episode Thirty Eight Minutes was followed by a recurring role for expository scenes with McKay and the leader of the expedition. Zelenka has since appeared in approximately half of each season's episodes and also appeared in the crossover episode The Pegasus Project of Stargate SG 1. The series finale of Atlantis, Enemy at the Gate , marks his last appearance. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category Dramatic Series Best Supporting Performance by a Male . Dr. Radek Zelenka is a careful and precise scientist of the original Atlantis Expedition who often supplements the scientific decisions of the equally brainy Dr. Rodney McKay, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. He frequently appears in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition for expository scenes to lay out an episode's premise to the audience, and is a key player in helping the Atlantis team stay one step ahead of the bad guys as well as solving some of its most perplexing scientific conundrums . GateWorld's David Read felt that while Zelenka may play second fiddle to Rodney , he is also the only one who even has the potential to put McKay down. Actor David Nykl explained that Zelenka has reasonably well honed social skills and can put up with a lot of stress ... and a lot of pressure, particularly from McKay and the situations that he can get into , but he may be too focused and determined to get one thing done. Zelenka recurs in all five seasons of Stargate Atlantis and is also among the Atlantis characters to appear in the Stargate SG 1 crossover episode The Pegasus Project . In his first appearance in the early Atlantis season 1 episode Thirty Eight Minutes , Zelenka helps devise a plan to free Major Sheppard's team including Dr. McKay from a potentially lethal technical problem. After a first short collaboration in Suspicion , Zelenka and McKay are the driving forces in finding a solution to protect the city of Atlantis from a massive hurricane in The Storm . Hot Zone reveals that Zelenka has been given the ATA gene therapy to enable him to operate Ancient technology, but the therapy had no effect on him. Season 2's Duet shows Zelenka off world for the first time, where he needs to save McKay and a soldier from being captured in a Wraith dart. Following a major dispute about an experimental Ancient power generator in Trinity , McKay apologizes to Zelenka when the experiment causes the death of a scientist. McKay saves Zelenka from certain death in Tao of Rodney and later apologizes for so often putting him down, admitting that Zelenka is a brilliant scientist and a decent human being . Zelenka last appears in the series finale of Atlantis, Enemy at the Gate , where he implements a wormhole drive that sends the city of Atlantis from the Pegasus Galaxy to Earth within seconds. From the beginning of Stargate Atlantis, the producers were looking for actors to play non Americans to present the cooperation between different nations and other groups of people in an alien environment. In fact, although in the series it is possible to see soldiers and technicians wearing in their uniforms flags that identify them as Russians, Japanese, South Africans, Belgians, Germans, Britons, Spaniards, etc, all main and secondary characters of earthly origin, except Zelenka, are Anglo Saxons Americans, a Canadian and a Scotsman. When actor David Nykl mentioned his Czech Canadian background during his audition for a Russian character for the season 1 episode Thirty Eight Minutes , the producers changed the character's nationality to Czech and cast him. Nykl made such an impression that producer Brad Wright wrote Zelenka into the Rodney McKay David Hewlett scenes of the next episode, Suspicion . Zelenka was re introduced in the mid season 1 finale The Storm , Martin Gero's second Atlantis episode. Gero had had difficulty with laying out the dangers of the storm and its solution in a quick and entertaining manner with just the McKay character, and Brad Wright was not opposed to introducing another expository character. Zelenka has since frequently appeared for expository scenes in the control room with McKay and the leader of the Atlantis expedition. Zelenka's given name is first mentioned by McKay in the season 1 finale The Siege McKay had previously been unable to remember Zelenka's name. The producers chose Radek , a fairly common Czech given name, without input from Nykl. When Colonel Samantha Carter Amanda Tapping replaced Dr. Elizabeth Weir Torri Higginson as the leader of the Atlantis expedition in season 4, the producers shifted the emphasis of Zelenka's collaboration with McKay to his interaction with Carter. By the end of the show's run, the interactions between Zelenka and McKay become more subtle to the point where they finish each other's sentences and need fewer words and expressions to get by. Portraying a recurring character, David Nykl was not under contract and neither knew his number of episodes nor his character's story arc in advance. Nevertheless, he appeared in approximately half of each season's episodes. No scenes with Zelenka were cut in the first two seasons of Atlantis, and extra scenes involving Zelenka were shot in the first episodes of the season 3 to fill time. However, all of David Nykl's scenes were cut from the season 5 episode The Shrine due to time constraints, although Nykl's credits appear in the finished episode. Since Zelenka's first appearance, David Nykl's fluent Czech was worked into Stargate Atlantis as part of Zelenka. Approximately half of Zelenka's Czech lines were scripted in English , which Nykl then translated verbatim. The other half was ad libbed and usually included swearing. His usual Czech exclamations include Ty vole and Do prdele. Nykl normally speaks with a Canadian accent, but Zelenka had a thick Czech accent Nykl found it increasingly hard to remember to put on the accent as the show went on. The late season 1 episode Letters from Pegasus features a minute long non subtitled monologue in which Zelenka describes the city of Atlantis in his mothertongue. Nykl translated the scripted monologue at home and performed it in Czech the next day. A version in English was initially planned to be filmed but was dropped after Nykl's successful first take. The end of Zelenka's video message drz se milacku take care, darling was ad libbed, but Nykl left it to the writers to create Zelenka's backstory. But during the show's run, Zelenka only ever mentions having a brother, a sister, and a nephew, and is never shown to be or have been in a romantic relationship. Often informing his superiors of critical situations, Zelenka earned the nickname Mr. Bad News among fans. In an interview with David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens referred to Zelenka as a popular and interesting character, and compared Zelenka's appearances in Atlantis to those of the Stargate SG 1 character Walter Harriman, a bit like the icing on the cake . Another interviewer mentioned that, following a warm reception , the fans have really taken to heart . When GateWorld hypothesized that viewers were looking forward to an episode where the underdog Zelenka saves the day instead of McKay, Nykl replied that the set up dynamic earns the character more sympathy from the audience. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category Dramatic Series Best Supporting Performance by a Male .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek%20Zelenka
"Zenbook also known as ZenBook are a family of ultrabooks low bulk laptop computers produced by Asus. The first Zenbooks were released in October 2011, and the original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012. Models range from 12 inch laptops featuring power efficient components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors, to 15 inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives. Most though not all Zenbooks use Intel Core ultra low voltage processors and Nvidia GPUs when integrated graphics are not used. Asus introduced new models with touch screens to take advantage of Windows 8 after its release in late 2012. Most models drew comparisons to the Macbook Air. The Zenbook mainly competes against computers such as Acer's Aspire, Dell's Inspiron and XPS, HP's Pavilion and Envy, Lenovo's IdeaPad and Toshiba's Satellite. Asus designed the Zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity, rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent the zen philosophy that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as the high quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. Some models such as the UX32 suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near complete unresponsive off state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging. In 2009 Asus released the UX50V, a 15 inch laptop that was focused on energy efficiency and had a thin profile. The laptop was rated poorly by reviewers as it under performed and had mediocre battery life, despite the installed energy efficient hardware. Although not branded as one, it bore the same UX product code as many of the later Zenbooks and was an early foray into the ultraportable market. The Zenbook name was proposed by Asus chairman Jonney Shih to reflect the zen philosophy applied to the design. The chief designer, Loewy Chen, had wanted to incorporate design elements from luxury watches into his products for a long time. Zenbooks were the first opportunity to put this into practice, the crossover being achieved, he said, by the unfolding of the laptop from the side recalling the elegance of minute and hour hand movements . The reference to watches is also reflected in the marketing of Zenbooks Asus published design sketches overlaying an open Zenbook on a watch face, and video advertisements feature similar imagery. The concentric circles on the lid of Zenbooks were intended to look like ripples in water and to reflect philosophical ideas such as the infinite nature of Zen thinking and self improvement . The bodies of the Zenbooks are made of aluminium, chosen for its light weight, strength, vibration dampening, appearance and acoustic properties. Both the bodies and lids are CNC milled and brushed for appearance. Reviewers have noted the resulting superior rigidity and complimented the appearance of the Zenbook range. To preserve space, some Zenbooks use two PCBs connected by a communications ribbon so it can have ports on both sides of the device, with a heatsink and fan centred between them. In 2018, Asus debuated ScreenPad with the ZenBook Pro 15 UX580. The ScreenPad replaces the regular trackpad with a colour capactive touchscreen display. This technology was then in 2019 included in the lower end ZenBook 13 UX334 , ZenBook 14 UX434 and ZenBook 15 UX534 and offered optionally on the lower end lineup of VivoBook S laptops. In 2019, as a successor the 2018's ZenBook Pro, the ZenBook Duo and ZenBook Pro Duo feature two screens one at the regular position and the other above keyboard. This second display resulted into the move of the keyboard nearer to the chin and the trackpad to where a numberpad would be similarly to Asus' gaming ROG Zephyrus laptop. Numerous Zenbook models with resolution specifications of QHD 3200 1800 and 4K 3840 2160 utilize Pentile RG BW displays, which are regarded by some as a shady practice and sort of cheating . i5 4200U or 500 750GB 2.5 SATA3 HDD 3 USB 3.0 port s 1 HDMI 1 mini Display Port 1 SD card reader 1 AC adapter plug Intel CoreTM i5 6200U Intel CoreTM i3 6100U Intel CoreTM i5 6200U Intel CoreTM i5 5200U 4210U Intel CoreTM i3 5010U 4030U Intel CoreTM i5 5200U Intel CoreTM M 5Y71 3 USB 3.0 port s 1 micro HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core M 6Y54 Intel Core M 6Y75 Intel CoreTM i5 5200U Intel CoreTM i3 5010U 2 USB 3.0 port s 1 USB 2.0 port s 1 micro HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel CoreTM i5 6200U Intel CoreTM i3 6100U Intel Core i5 6200U 1 USB 3.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 micro HDMI 1 microSDXC card reader 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 7200U 6200U Intel Core i3 7100U 6100U 1 USB 3.0 port 1 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8250U 7200U 6200U Intel Core i3 7100U 6100U Intel Core i5 7200U 6200U 1 USB 3.0 port 2 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8250U Intel Core i5 8250U 7200U Intel Core i3 7100U Intel Core i5 6200U 2 USB 3.0 port 2 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug 2 USB 3.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 micro HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 7200U Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Core i5 8250U 2 USB 3.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i7 7500U Intel Core i3 7100U 2 USB 3.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 micro HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8250U Intel Core i3 7100U Intel Core i5 7200U Intel Core i3 7100U 1 USB 3.0 port 2 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8265U Intel Core i7 8565U 512GB PCIe X2 SSD 1TB PCIe X4 SSD 1.19kg glossy display 1 USB 3.1 port 1 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 HDMI 1 microSD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8265U Intel Core i5 8265U Intel Core i7 8565U Intel Core i5 8265U 1.69kg glossy display 1 USB 3.1 port 1 USB 3.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8265U 512GB PCIe X2 SSD 1TB PCIe X4 SSD 1 USB 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 HDMI 1 microSD card slot 1 AC adapter plug 512GB PCIe X2 SSD 1TB PCIe X2 SSD 1TB PCIe X4 SSD 1 USB 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core M 6Y54 Intel Core M 6Y30 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 SD card slot 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 7200U 6200U Intel Core i5 6200U 3 USB 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8250U 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 HDMI 1 microSD card slot 1 AC adapter plug 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 2 USB 3.0 ports 1 SD card slot 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug 1 USB C Thunderbolt 2 USB 3.0 ports 1 SD card slot 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 8265U 2 USB C 3.1 Gen 2 port 1 USB 2.0 port 1 HDMI 1 AC adapter plug 1 USB C 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1 port 1 USB 2.0 1 HDMI 1 SD card reader 1 AC adapter plug The 86Wh option is only available for devices with SSD. 383 x 255 x 21.3 6 cell 3 USB 3.0 1 HDMI 1 mini DisplayPort 1 Thunderbolt some 1 SD card reader 1 AC adapter plug 4 USB 3.0 1 HDMI 1 Thunderbolt 1 SD card reader 1 AC adapter plug Intel Core i5 7300HQ or 512GB 1TB PCIe SSD 2 x Type A USB 3.1 Gen 1 1 x HDMI 1 x Combo audio jack 1 x microSD Card reader Intel Core i5 8265U or 256 512GB PCIe X2 SSD or 1TB PCIe X4 SSD 1 x Type A USB 3.1 Gen 2 1 x Type A USB 2.0 1 x HDMI 1 x Combo audio jack 1 x AC adapter plug Intel Core i7 8750H Intel Core i9 8950HK or 512GB 1TB PCIe SSD 2 x Type A USB 3.1 Gen 2 1 x HDMI 1 x Combo audio jack 1 x MicroSD card slot 1 x AC adapter plug 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type A up to 10Gbps 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A up to 5Gbps 1 x HDMI 1 x Audio combo jack 1 x MicroSD card reader 1 x DC in Intel Core i7 9750H 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type A up to 10Gbps 1 x HDMI 1 x Audio combo jack 1 x DC in 2 x USB 3.1 Type C port Intel Core i5 7200U 1 x USB 3.1 Type C port Intel Core i5 8250U 3 x USB 3.1 Type C port Intel Core i5 8250U 2 x USB C 3.1 Gen 2 Thunderbolt 1 x USB C 3.1 Gen 1 Intel Core i5 8265U Intel Core i5 8265U 2 x USB C 3.1 Gen 2 Thunderbolt 1 x USB A 3.1 Gen 2 1 x microSD card slot The first official ZenBooks, the ZenBook UX21E and UX31E drew comparisons to the Macbook Air and it was regarded as an excellent rival by CNET reviewer Andrew Hoyle. Other aspects of the laptops that reviewers liked were the Bang and Olufsen speakers, fast boot times due to Asus' BIOS design and the speed of general tasks within the operating system resulting from the SSD and Sandy Bridge processors. However, the screens drew criticism for their poor contrast ratio, colour accuracy and less than perfect viewing angle, although they were praised for their brightness and the sharpness of the UX31's screen. Reviewers also noted the shallow key press of the metal keyboard and lack of backlighting, a feature that Asus did not have time to implement before shipping. The new screens on the ZenBook Prime were highly praised by reviewers when considering brightness, contrast ratio, viewing angle and colour accuracy, the improvements over previous models being put down to the switch from TN to IPS displays. The keyboard also garnered praise for the increased backlighting and improved key travel while the Intel Wi Fi controller was found to perform better than the Qualcomm used in the first generation of Zenbooks. The Zenbook Primes still received some criticism the latest version of the trackpad was acknowledged as an improvement over the original Zenbooks, but still irritating, and the sound quality was found to be worse than that with the first generation. Despite these issues, the overall reaction was positive the UX31A was called today's best ultrabook and the best ultrabook out there at the time of release. The ZenBook UX32VD was well received for similar reasons to the Zenbook Prime. The screen, chassis and keyboard again garnered praise although the inclusion of a discrete GPU was noted as a major selling point. The hybrid drive attracted criticism for its slow performance and the same trackpad issues that the Zenbook Prime had were still present. SLR Lounge criticised the slow hybrid drive and 4 GB of RAM, but suggested replacing them as the option is available, noting that it was an option not often offered on ultrabooks. As a cheaper option the ZenBook UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being a more affordable luxury , retaining the premium feel of the Zenbook range but at a lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to keep costs down, was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found quite suitable for outdoor use , noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours. The ZenBook UX42VS and UX52VS drew criticism for its high price and lack of touch screen, but the screen quality, keyboard and system speed were praised. The battery life was considered acceptable taking into account the form factor and the discrete GPU, despite it being significantly shorter than the UX31A. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price. The ZenBook UX430 is commonly reported to suffer from significant coil whine issues. Cite error A list defined reference named ux21engadget is not used in the content see the help page .

"Zennor Head znr hd is a 750 metre 2,460 ft long promontory on the Cornish coast of England, between Pendour Cove and Porthzennor Cove. Facing the Atlantic Ocean, it lies 1 kilometre north west of the village of Zennor and 1.6 kilometres east of the next promontory, Gurnard's Head. The granite Killas cliffs rise over 200 feet 60 m from the sea and the highest point of the headland is 314 feet 96 m above sea level, with an Ordnance Survey triangulation station. Zennor Head is on the South West Coast Path, which follows the cliff edge closely, skirting the entire perimeter of the headland. The promontory is part of the Penwith Heritage Coast, and is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom that begins with the letter Z . It gets its name from a local saint, Senara. Zennor Head was mined for copper and tin in the Victorian Era. There is no longer any residential or commercial occupancy on the headland, but it is occupied by a variety of coastal animals and plants, such as kestrels and gorse. The name Zennor Head originates from the name of a local saint, Senara. According to local legend, Senara was thrown off a headland in Brittany in a barrel after being falsely accused of adultery by her husband and washed up on the Cornish coast, founding Zennor and giving her name to the eponymous village and subsequently Zennor Head, Zennor Quoit and Porthzennor Cove , before continuing to Ireland. The s changed to a z , an occurrence common in the West Country but rare elsewhere, and as such is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom to begin with the letter Z . The headland is bordered by Cornish granite hedges, and the farming system dates from about 4000 BC, the time of the Bronze Age in Cornwall. The surrounding area and village of Zennor has been continually occupied for over 4,000 years. Zennor Head was mined extensively for copper and tin in the 19th century, and drainage adits remain visible on the eastern side. The promontory was donated to the National Trust in December 1953. The Southwest Coast Path was created in 1978, and runs along the top of Zennor Head as part of its 630 miles 1,010 km , following the edge of the cliffs closely. Zennor in Darkness, the 1994 McKitterick Prize winning novel by Helen Dunmore, was partly set around Zennor Head. In 2009 the headland suffered flooding which affected the cliff top footpath. The promontory has been designated as part of the Penwith Heritage Coast. Zennor Head is located on the north coast of Cornwall, England, facing the Atlantic Ocean. A headland extending some 750 metres 2,460 ft , it is surrounded by steep cliffs plunging into the sea below. It is west of the town of St Ives, and north east of the town of Penzance. The nearest human settlement is the village of Zennor, and the headland is flanked by two coves, Pendour and Porthzennor. The nearest headland is Gurnard's Head, 1.6 kilometres to the west. Access is from the South West Coast Path, or the B3306 road West Cornwall coast road . There is a deep inlet known as Horseback Zawn on the western side, where seabirds nest. The headland is topped by an Ordnance Survey Trig Point . The Killas strata, which is exposed over the majority of Zennor Head, is a sedimentary rock formation laid down in the Devonian period, between approximately 415 and 375 million years ago myr . Zennor Head is on the surface boundary of the so called Land's End Granite , part of the Cornubian batholith which dates from 279 to 274 myr. However, the intrusion of the granite into the Killas strata altered it metamorphically into a shale type rock. Zennor Head is home to a variety of wildlife, including the Cornish chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax . Grey seals Halichoerus grypus have been sighted off the coast. Many seabirds nest on the cliffs, especially around Horseback Zawn, including herring gulls Larus argentatus and fulmars Fulmarus glacialis . Kestrels Falco tinnunculus hunt inland of the shoreline. The headland is primarily covered with grass, as well as heather Calluna vulgaris , bracken Pteridium aquilinum , thyme Thymus polytrichus and western gorse Ulex gallii . In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover Trifolium occidentale were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north , seaward side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder Cuscuta epithymum is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria , sea campion Silene uniflora , and thrift Armeria maritima .

"Zero , Zero is the protagonist and playable character of the 2013 action role playing game Drakengard 3, the third main entry in the Drakengard series, developed by Access Games and published by Square Enix. She also appeared in the arcade game Lord of Vermilion III. Zero is an Intoner, one of six god like beings who control magic through their singing abilities. In trying to destroy the flower that gave birth to her powers and tried to use her to destroy humanity, she sets out to kill the five other Intoners spawned from her body by the flower to carry out its mission, referred to as her sisters. Zero was created by Taro Yoko, the game's director and co writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist that had not been featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively. Zero was conceived by Taro Yoko, the director and co writer of Drakengard 3. While conceiving her, Yoko thought it would be interesting to do a character who had worked in a brothel, as the concept had not been often explored and the Drakengard series offered an opportunity for such a protagonist to be created. This sexual aspect of the character was generally conveyed through dialogue rather than cutscenes. One of the earlier ideas for Zero's role in the game was to have her as a schoolgirl with a cellphone in a contemporary setting, but this was quickly decided against. Eventually, Yoko decided to create more female characters for Zero to interact with one of the reasons behind this was that all other possible choices for the game had been rejected. Her number based name, along with the names of all her sisters, were meant to make it easier for players to identify and distinguish them. Yoko helped write her dialogue to complement the game's unusual situations, such as rude conversations between her and the disciples during moments of carnage. Multiple aspects of Zero's character and worldview were incorporated into the game's theme song This Silence is Mine by composers Keiichi Okabe and Onitsuka Chihiro. The choice of Zero's voice actress was an important part of her design, as the team wanted to both have a good performance and surprise the audience Maaya Uchida, normally known for gentler female roles in anime and video games, was chosen for the role. Zero was designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka, a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series. His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god like being, and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance, but as the game's atmosphere was finalized, Fujisaka redesigned her with some unaesthetic elements, taking direct influence from the game atmosphere this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm. The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka's part. Her color palate was intended as a reverse of Caim, the protagonist of Drakengard. Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal, a key character in the earlier Drakengard games. She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied. Her final design, along with the flower in her eye, emphasized her sexuality. She originally had no flower in her design, but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance. The decision to place it in her eye was to add originality to the character while the game's producer Takamata Shiba originally feared it was too much of a risk in conjunction with her gender, Yoko approved of the design. After Zero was finalized, Yoko decided on more female characters, and told Fujisaka to think Puella Magi Madoka Magica while designing them. Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners. Her design, along with the rest of the main characters, was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the medieval inspiration of previous games. In Zero's prequel novella, A Rain to End and a Flower to Begin , it is revealed that Zero was abused by her mother and sold into prostitution. Eventually escaping, she grew to live by killing and stealing, with the killing eventually becoming an unconscious instinct. Eventually, she was weakened by a deadly disease and was caught and imprisoned, dying from her illness there. Upon dying, she was revived and turned into an Intoner by a magical flower intent on destroying mankind. Learning the flower's plans for her, Zero tried to kill herself, but the flower kept her alive, and spawned five other Intoners as a safety measure these Intoners were Zero's sisters . The sisters eventually took control of the land from the native warlords. Eventually, Zero decides to kill her sisters, then herself to rid the world of the flower. In the prequel manga Drag On Dragoon 3 Utahime Five, told from the point of view of the other Intoners, it is revealed that she is directly responsible for the creation of the Disciples, used by her in an attempt to destroy the Intoners. By the events of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a partnership with the dragon Michael as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple, a servant created to magnify the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail safe in the event of Zero's victory. Around this central timeline, various branches appear, caused by singularities , namely Zero, her sisters and the Disciples. During her progression through these branches, Zero is monitored by Accord, one of a race called Recorders charged with monitoring and recording history. In the second branch, while going to kill her sister Three, Zero witnesses the flower driving her sisters insane, with Three dying from poisons in the forest and One being murdered by an unhinged Two. In the ensuing battle, the disciples and Two are killed, then Mikhail is poisoned. Zero uses the flower to form a pact with Mikhail, resurrecting him. In the third branch, Mikhail is regressed by the Intoners to a childlike form incapable of properly defending Zero, and Zero's disciples are killed when Two self destructs. When Mikhail is killed by One's dragon, Zero and One do battle and One is killed. Mentally unbalanced by the event, Zero sets off to find another dragon, but it is hinted that she fails. In the fourth branch, Zero manages to kill all of her sisters and absorb their powers, managing to take down One with help from Accord. After absorbing all their powers, she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic is sealed away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form. In the novel Drag On Dragoon 3 Story Side, a novel detailing the events leading directly into Drakengard, a combination of events from other branches occurs. During the final confrontation with One, Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him. After killing One, One's clone kills Zero. Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network Zero has received a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she related to as the game progressed, which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters. Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into a jet black comedy , comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort while both unlikable characters, there was something magnetic about their horribleness . Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying was drawn into Drakengard 3's world and its cast of characters, and I wanted to see Zero's journey through from start to finish. This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed. Jim Sterling of The Escapist wrote that Zero's portrayal, especially her sexual empowerment and the fact that she had dominance over the male characters, was refreshing . Capsule Computers' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is largely the villain of the series , but that he felt the need to see her journey through to its end. Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters, claimed that Zero was the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch. Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language a nicely self contained example of how plays with juxtaposition. Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons. RPGFan's Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as foul mouthed butcher , although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter strange and often hilarious . Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as violence personified , noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed. Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action game protagonists, referring to her as murderous, foul mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all but impossible to like. In contrast, Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer was not as enthusiastic, saying that while Zero had some good one liners, the better efforts are buried in a lot of bad party banter. RPGamer's Michael Cunningham found Zero to be an angry, vulgar woman ... impatient, aggressive, and easily irritated , and that the lack of explanation behind Zero's actions negatively affected the plot. IGN's Meghan Sullivan was also fairly negative, saying that Zero's character, interactions and motivation were badly let down by poor writing. USGamer's Kat Bailey was generally unenthusiastic about Zero's general attitude and portrayal, saying that she was characterized in large part by her apparent love of killing and her aggressive bitchiness toward her companion dragon . Roger Hargreaves for Metro agreed, finding Zero to be a thoroughly unpleasant and unlikeable main character. Crunchyroll's Nate Ming was highly critical of Zero, calling her a ruthless, backstabbing, front stabbing, cold hearted bitch , and said that she would be the villain in any other game. The character has been positively received by series fans in Japan. In a popularity contest for the characters of Drakengard 3, Zero came in as the fourth most popular character of the game, with her dragon Mikhail taking first place. In the 2014 Dengeki PlayStation Awards, Zero was placed as the fourth best character of 2013. Beyond the Drakengard universe, both Zero had her dragon Mikhail appeared in the second sequel to the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. Access Games 2014 05 20 . Drakengard 3. PlayStation 3.

"Zero Japanese is a video game character present throughout Capcom's Mega Man franchise. First appearing in the 1993 game Mega Man X for the Super Nintendo, Zero is a Maverick Hunter A mechanical soldier or Reploid in charge of defeating Mavericks Reploids who turned against humanity and their more utilitarian counterparts Mechaniloids . He continues his job as the main character of the Mega Man Zero series. Zero has also played a supporting role in other game series such as the Mega Man ZX series and appeared in crossover video games as a guest character. First developed by Keiji Inafune when he was attempting to create a new design for the X series, Zero was instead used as a secondary character. In the Zero series developed by Inti Creates , Zero was the protagonist and had a change in his design that was meant to impart a more human feel to him. Zero has since also played a minor role in the ZX series as Model Z. His inclusion in the Mega Man X series has generally received positive critical response from reviewers. His story within the Mega Man Zero series received similar response, at least partly due to how much darker and mature Zero became compared to previous Mega Man characters. Zero was created by designer Keiji Inafune when he was told to recreate Mega Man for a new series on the Super Nintendo, Mega Man X. He wanted to design a Mega Man different from the original one. However, Inafune realized afterwards that the character he created was too different from Mega Man's old appearance to be viewed positively by fans. Deciding to let another designer work on the character that eventually became Mega Man X while he developed Zero, Inafune created the character intending him to be the 'other main character' that would steal all the good scenes . He further described Zero as representing the idea that nothing is absolute , and circumstances can change anything. When asked if Zero had killed the cast of the original Mega Man titles, suspected due to their absence in the X series, he replied no, adding that given how he had designed the character, Zero is not such a person it is not in his profile. Believing they were too similar in Mega Man X3 in which Zero could only be played as for part of each level , Capcom wanted Zero to be further distinguished from X for his first appearance as a fully playable character in Mega Man X4. This resulted in the removal of his Z Buster his equivalent of X's X Buster , leaving only his lightsaber esque Z Saber. This close range combat weapon stood in stark contrast to X's projectile weapons. Due to the difficulty of playing as Zero, the vast majority of the developers were against that decision at first during Mega Man X4. As a result, Zero was given special techniques some of which hailed from the Street Fighter franchise by defeating each boss, which resulted in the approval from the developers. In order to make Zero's story to be more engaging, Capcom created Iris, a female Reploid, believing it was a fresh idea not used in previous games in the series. The concept of Zero starring in his own series was proposed by Inafune. Inafune proposed that Zero star in his own series, and planned to go forward with the idea at the end of Mega Man X5. However, he was unable to after Capcom announced another Mega Man title without his involvement. Designed by Toru Nakayama of Inti Creates, Zero was meant to have a more human feel rather than the complete mechanical feel of the X series. Nakayama wanted the public to recognize that this series was different from the X series. Since Capcom wanted Zero's general structure to be the same, Inti Creates concentrated on how different they could make him, rather than how similar. Zero's depiction in the series was intended to be morally ambiguous and depend on the perspective, appearing as a hero from one point of view and a terrorist from another. Designed to be harder and wilder than the original Mega Man, Zero's design ultimately resembled Mega Man X in several ways due to his initial character concept, Inafune's insistence on drawing the character, and input from other project artists. In the X series, Zero has red and white armor with twin horns on his helmet. Zero also has his signature long blonde hair. His main weapon is the Z saber, an energy based sword that introduced melee combat to the Mega Man games. His secondary weapon is the Z buster, a cannon mounted at the end of his right arm, similar to Mega Man X's primary weapon. A tertiary weapon that would orbit around Zero was also considered, but left uncompleted. Unlike the original Mega Man, who had a full head of hair under his helmet, Zero has a smooth secondary helmet, intended to imply the characters were older. In Mega Man X4, Zero was going to receive his own enhanced armor in the same way X does, but the development team decided not to finish it. In the Zero series, Zero sported a much more humanized and sleeker redesign. His mecha inspired armor was eschewed for a red uniform consisting of a vest, gloves, and boots, while his arms and legs were more anatomically detailed. His Z buster was no longer fused inside his hand, instead it was a handgun, Buster Shot, that fired energy bullets. The Z saber also became a triangular holographic blade, rather than a lightsaber like weapon. Early concept art featured Zero with solid black, pupil less eyes, though this changed to a normal set of eyes as development progressed. Zero made his debut appearance in Mega Man X in 1993, and a cameo appearance in Mega Man 2 The Power Fighters. In the latter, Zero was revealed to have been originally created by Dr. Wily sometime during the Mega Man series. Zero works as a Maverick Hunter, a soldier in charge of defeating Mavericks, robots who turned against humanity. He plays the role as X's comrade and best friend in the X series. The two, later accompanied by Axl, fight Sigma, Vile, and other enemies throughout the series. While in the first two titles he only assists X during gameplay, he becomes an optional character in X3. In Mega Man X4, Zero is one of two playable characters, along with X. In his scenario, Zero is haunted by nightmares of a shadowy figure implied to be Wily awakening him and giving him orders to destroy an unknown individual, and visions of ensuing carnage. Additionally, during his scenario, Sigma reminds him of the time that he led the Maverick Hunters, and the encounter between the two that led to a vicious battle that led to Sigma punching out the crystal on Zero's helmet, leading to Sigma later becoming infected with the Maverick Virus. Depending on the story development, Zero can be fought as a boss character in Mega Man X5. In Mega Man X6, Zero is not initially present in the game since he went missing in the end of Mega Man X5 during a fight against Sigma, and he becomes an optional character depending on how the story develops throughout the game. In the spin off title Mega Man Xtreme, he is an assistant character but becomes playable in the sequel, Mega Man Xtreme 2. He is also playable during the prologue and the last chapters from the role playing video game Mega Man X Command Mission. The Mega Man Zero series features Zero as the title character and protagonist. Set around 100 years after the X series, Zero helps a scientist named Ciel fight the human city of Neo Arcadia, during which he destroys Omega his original body, Dr. Weil, and Copy X, leader of Neo Arcadia, twice. Zero makes an appearance in the ZX series as Model Z, who plays a minor supporting role in the plot in the first ZX game. In ZX Advent, Zero plays an even smaller role, only having a few lines throughout the game. Zero's Mega Man Battle Network counterpart, Zero.EXE makes an appearance in Mega Man Network Transmission as the antagonist of the first half of the game. He later aids Mega Man against the true villain, The Professor . The Mega Man Zero version of Zero's character appears as a sub boss in SNK's crossover fighting game SNK vs. Capcom SVC Chaos and as a hidden character in Onimusha Blade Warriors. The Mega Man X version of Zero appears as a hidden character in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All Stars and as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 Fate of Two Worlds, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite. and in Project X Zone and its sequel Project X Zone 2. In the latter titles, Zero was chosen to represent the Mega Man franchise over Mega Man himself, as director Ryota Niitsuma thought he had more variation in his moves. Zero also appears as a collectable trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Both games feature a Mii Fighter costume based on Zero as downloadable content. Zero's appearances in the two manga series based on the Mega Man X series resemble his video game portrayal. However, in the Mega Man Zero manga, Zero is depicted as a Reploid having two personalities depending on his usage of a helmet without his helmet he is portrayed as cowardly, whereas the other one resembles his video game counterpart. Zero also makes guest appearances in the Mega Man comic series by Archie Comics, appearing in stories set shortly before the events of Mega Man X and as part of the Worlds Unite crossover event. Zero's character was met with positive critical response by publications for video games. Game Revolution called him mysterious, androgynous and compared him to Proto Man with a ponytail . Jeese Scheeden from IGN named him one of his ten favorite sword wielding characters in the video games, describing him as an answer to the question of how Mega Man would fight if armed with a sword, and noted his fighting style as popular with gamers. GameZone writer Michael Knutson praised the inclusion of Zero in the Mega Man X series, citing his playability as popular amongst series fan as it expanded the gameplay. Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com stated that his appearance as a playable character with his own story in Mega Man X4 by itself made it the best game in the X series. GameSpot noted the contrast in his gameplay to that of Mega Man X in Mega Man X4 increased the difficulty of using him in the title. Additionally, Brett Elston from GamesRadar credited Zero as one of the reasons the X series became so popular and that his own popularity within gamers earned him his own video game series. Zero's connections with the original Mega Man characters have been the subject of speculations within fans. As it is believed that Dr. Wily created Zero in the image of Protoman or the possibility that he was responsible for multiple deaths offscreen as it is unknown what happened to the original Mega Man cast, explaining their absence in the X storyline. In 2018, Capcom left clues about how Wily dies when creating Zero but the idea of Zero killing the Mega Man characters was negated. IGN repeated their positive sentiments about Zero in their list of characters they wished to see appear in a future Marvel vs. Capcom title, describing him as arguably cooler than Mega Man , regardless of version in comparison. PSM praised the character as well, stating might wear some funky shoes, but that doesn't stop him from kicking some robot butt . While reviewing Mega Man X Command Mission, 1UP.com criticized that his English voice acting makes him sound like a surfer . GamesRadar also cited Zero's actors across the X series, finding the first from X4, Wayne Doster, unappealing due to his infamous scene where he yells in front of the dead Iris. On the other hand, the site praised Yong Bosch's take on the character, believing it was likable. The fandom in general found the scene where he yells What am I fighting for as one of the worst parts in voice acting in Mega Man history alongside some cutscenes from Mega Man 8 to the point of calling it an horror . In regards to his Mega Man Zero incarnation, GameSpot believed the character's redesign was well employed based on his presentation. IGN considered Zero's retake be like a breakout character due to how he develops his own skills unlike previous versions of the Mega Man cast. Destructoid simply described Zero as a red death machine who uses pistols, lightsabers, shields, and multiple other melee weapons... due to his dark characterization when compared with previous main characters. Nevertheless, Nintendo Life noticed that across Zero's spin off, the title Reploid continuously showed a character arc that would make him more likable to gamers, earning the spotlight for the first time based on how he was originally a side character. Similarly, US Gamer referred to Zero to have one of the more elaborated story arcs in the Mega Man franchise in general due to how he changes between the X series and the Mega Man Zero. The writer further added that the apparent misrelationship between Zero and X before the revelation the latter was a clone gone corrupted was one of the darkest things seen in Capcom's games due to the idea of Zero working to kill X, the former protagonist of the series.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%20%28Mega%20Man%29
"Zero Hour is the twenty fourth and final episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek Enterprise the seventy seventh episode overall. It first aired on May 26, 2004, on the UPN network within the United States. Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship, Enterprise, registration NX 01. Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi. In this episode, Sub Commander T'Pol leads the Enterprise on an attack on 'Sphere 41' in an attempt to destroy the sphere network within the Delphic Expanse. Meanwhile, a team led by Captain Jonathan Archer has infiltrated the Xindi weapon while it is en route to Earth. Both the spheres and the weapon are destroyed, but Archer is lost, presumed dead. Enterprise returns to Earth but the crew suddenly find that they have been sent back in time to a very different Second World War. The episode was written by series co creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga and was directed by Allan Kroeker. The episode took eight days to film and included a larger guest cast than normal for episodes of Enterprise, as well as two competition winners. The twist at the end of Zero Hour was originally conceived by the writers as a joke, but was developed over the course of the third season to become the concept of alien Nazis . This twist was further explained and resolved in the season four two part opener Storm Front . Roughly 3.91 million viewers watched Zero Hour on first broadcast. Sub Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in an attempt to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a distortion field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 1215 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, T'Pol and Commander Tucker deduce a modification to the deflector dish that can be used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent the spheres destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the Delphic Expanse. Meanwhile, Captain Archer, accompanied by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, and a team of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi weapon. During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is pushed by Archer to decipher Degra's schematics. Archer is suddenly pulled into the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the weapon. A fierce fire fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the weapon, Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the weapon is destroyed. Sato and Reed return to Enterprise with the sad news that Archer did not make it off the weapon. Ferried on an Aquatic ship, Enterprise arrives at Earth, but they are unable to contact Starfleet. Surprised, T'Pol orders Tucker and Ensign Mayweather to fly a shuttlepod down to San Francisco, where they are suddenly attacked by what seem to be P 51s. The final scene switches to a World War II German field hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar uniform of a burn patient who was recently brought in. The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray skinned alien. Zero Hour was the culmination of a season long storyline first introduced by the events of The Expanse , wherein an alien race called the Xindi attacks Earth and kills seven million people. During the course of the third season, the Enterprise went into the previously unexplored Delphic Expanse to search for the Xindi and to prevent a further attack which will destroy Earth. Executive producer and writer Brannon Braga felt that the end of the season in a three part arc composed of The Council , Countdown and Zero Hour , which he compared to three acts of the same story. The episode was written by Braga alongside Rick Berman. The duo were the co creators of Star Trek Enterprise. The idea that Enterprise would be successful in its mission was planned from the start of the development of the year long storyline. However, the producers and writing team would joke that there would be a bizarre twist such as the crew returning to Earth and discovering that it was now ruled by giant cockroaches. The writers decided against a Xindi based cliffhanger and sought an unusual twist. Braga said that I can't remember who said 'Nazis,' but we just somehow ended up with Nazis. Then that didn't even feel like enough, so we decided to make them alien Nazis. He expected it would make the returning episode in season four really interesting , and wanted to end the series on something wacky . Most of the cast were not given the final few pages of the script until they were already in production. Actor Dominic Keating, who portrays Malcolm Reed on Enterprise, called the ending a lovely twist... that just makes you scratch your head and wonder at what you've just seen. The twist was wrapped up at the start of season four with the two part episode Storm Front . It was the third time that Nazis had appeared in the Star Trek franchise. The first was in the episode Patterns of Force in Star Trek The Original Series, and then again on the holodeck on Star Trek Voyager in the two part The Killing Game . In the episode, T'Pol states that Zero Hour takes place in 2152, a statement which contradicts other episodes. Manny Coto, executive producer and show runner for the following season, explained that this was a mistake in the script. It was later stated in the timeline published in Voyages of Imagination by Jeff Ayers that the events of Zero Hour took place on February 14, 2154, a day after the setting of the episode Countdown . Allan Kroeker directed the episode. He had previously directed the season two closing episode The Expanse , and the first episode of season three, The Xindi . Previously in the franchise, he had directed the finale of both Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Voyager. Production began on March 5 and was completed eight working days later. Because there was no ability to shoot scenes using a second unit during the production of a following episode, ten pages of script were shot on the final day of filming instead of the normal seven or eight. Zero Hour was the final episode of Enterprise to be shot on film stock, as for the following season, the decision was made to switch to high definition digital video. Scott Bakula stated in an interview on The Wayne Brady Show that there were three endings to the episode filmed. This was later denied by Dominic Keating while on stage at Creation Entertainment's Grand Slam event in Pasadena in March 2004. He did clarify that the script for the final scene was delivered to his house in three envelopes, accompanied by a security guard with a dog. Bakula explained later during an online chat for the official Star Trek website that only one ending was ever filmed. Zero Hour featured a guest and stunt cast larger than usual for episodes of Enterprise. For the final day of filming, there were 35 extras on set. The additional actors appearing in Zero Hour included J. Paul Boehmer, who portrayed an SS agent at the end of the episode. Boehmer had appeared several times previous in the Star Trek franchise, and his first part ever as an actor was as a holographic Nazi Captain in the Voyager episode The Killing Game . He had also previously appeared in Enterprise as the Vulcan Mestral in the episode Carbon Creek . Boehmer returned to reprise his role from Zero Hour during the two part Storm Front in season four. In addition to the actors appearing on the episode, two members of the public made walk on appearances as Starfleet crewmen on the engineering set. These were Amy Ulen, who had won the prize on KZOK FM. She was a high school English and drama teacher. Joining her was DJ Bob Rivers from the Seattle based UPN affiliate radio station. Also appearing was Brian D'Arcy who gained his role through a charity auction held by Wired magazine to benefit the Starbright Foundation. Ulen would later have a cameo in the fan production Star Trek Of Gods and Men. Zero Hour was first broadcast on May 26, 2004, on the UPN network within the United States. It was watched by 3.91 million viewers. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.5 4 percent, which meant that it was seen by 2.5 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast. Zero Hour placed UPN in fifth place in the ratings during the timeslot. The episode was first broadcast in the UK later that year on June 7, on Sky One. Prior to the broadcast of the finale of season three, there were rumours that the series was going to be cancelled. UPN decided to renew the series, but moved it for season four to Friday nights, and so Zero Hour was the final episode of Enterprise to be broadcast on a Wednesday evening. Michael Westmore, make up supervisor on Enterprise, was nominated for Outstanding Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special Prosthetic at the 2004 Emmy Awards for his work on Zero Hour . The award instead went to James McKinnon for his work on an episode of Nip Tuck. Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, found the ending of the episode amusing, describing it as an insane left hook of a cliffhanger . She praised the character development elsewhere in the episode, but kept returning to what she described as EVIL ALIEN NAZIS . Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave the episode two and a half out of four stars. He said that the episode featured several science fiction cliches, such as having the Xindi weapon destroyed in Earth's orbit. He said that the final scene of the episode was the Ultimate WTF ending and compared it to the jarring finale of Tim Burton's version of the film Planet of the Apes. In David Greven's book, Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek, the author states that the declaration by Daniels that Reed and Hoshi were unimportant to future events meant that racial and cultural Others were not important to the future . But by saying that Archer was indeed required for the future to proceed as expected, it was a statement about the need for institutional white male power . Greven asserted that this was part of the writing on Enterprise which changed following the new political direction after the September 11 attacks, whereas the previous post Star Trek The Next Generation series had been progressively multi cultural during the period of the Bill Clinton administration. WhatCulture ranked this episode the 12th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise. The first home media release of Zero Hour was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013, and season three was released on January 7, 2014. Jay Chattaway's music for the episode was released as part of the four disc Star Trek Enterprise Collection on December 2, 2014, including the orchestral pieces Sphere Builder On Board Andorian Offensive Sphere Final Showdown and My Captain .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%20Hour%20%28Star%20Trek%3A%20Enterprise%29
"Zero Hour is the fourth episode from Season 8 of the military science fiction television series Stargate SG 1. It was written by producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Peter Woeste. Clips of the episode were shown on Late Night with Conan O'Brien before Season 8 began, with Late Night graphic designer Pierre Bernard making a cameo appearance in the episode. The first airing of Zero Hour on July 30, 2004 on the American Sci Fi Channel was viewed by 3 million people. The episode received mixed reviews. Zero Hour takes place shortly after the promotion of main character Jack O'Neill from Colonel to Brigadier General. With O'Neill being the new leader of Stargate Command SGC , Lt. Col. Samantha Carter has assumed O'Neill's old position as leader of the SG 1 unit. The idea to have the episode focus on General O'Neill solving various problems at his new job came from the writers' wondering what the general of the SGC does while his teams are on missions. The episode takes place over the course of five days, counting down to an at first unrevealed event named Zero Hour . Five days to Zero Hour, General O'Neill is introduced to his new administrative aide, Mark Gilmor, who makes a suspicious phone call. Meanwhile, O'Neill's new position as a general is twofold. He needs to decide decorations for an upcoming official visit, and prepare SG 1 for its next offworld trip. A quickly growing alien plant and the arrival of two brawly Amrans, possible trade partners from another world, lead O'Neill to write a letter to General Hammond, his predecessor. At four days to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover many areas of the base. After SG 1 go missing on their off world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al contacts Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG 1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system . With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation. Although Camulus leaves Earth, Ba'al does not send back SG 1. When all SG teams announce their trust and support for the general, SG 1 dial the Stargate from offworld, revealing that they were never captured by Ba'al but instead were trapped in a secret base. After their safe return, O'Neill attests new SG 1 leader Samantha Carter's positive leadership skills. It is revealed that the ZPM Camulus was given to supposedly kill Ba'al which Ba'al would use to destroy Earth was actually the dead one from Antarctica. Zero Hour makes up the last minutes of the episode. The President is about to arrive, and Gilmor announces that his special assignment, initiated by the President's order, will end the next day. Gilmor expresses his respect, and as they leave to greet the President, the camera zooms in on the resignation letter on O'Neill's desk, with the last words, Never mind . Despite being fourth in the airing order, Zero Hour was filmed as the seventh out of the twenty episodes of Season 8. The limited availability of Richard Dean Anderson Jack O'Neill , who only worked 3.5 days out of five working days a week during the eighth season, extended the seven day filming period to four weeks. With Zero Hour being a bottle episode to save money, director Peter Woeste filmed the majority of the episode on the standing SGC sets at The Bridge Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The labs of Dr. Lee and Carter were filmed in the same room of the standing set, and a storage room for filming equipment was remodeled into the office of Gilmor. Second unit director Andy Mikita was responsible for the off world scenes of the SG teams, filmed in Tynehead Park, one of the few undeveloped Vancouver locations that still allows filming. O'Neill in his sleeping quarters was the episode's last filmed scene, shot in two takes to allow Anderson to catch his flight home to Los Angeles. The inspiration for the episode came from the SG 1 writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG 1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was A Day in the Life of General O'Neill , but writer Robert C. Cooper felt Zero Hour was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit at the end of the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the emergency lighting goes off. He achieved depth by using differently colored lights in the control room and near the gate. Zero Hour features several guest stars. Los Angeles actor David Kaufman was brought in to play the part of Mark Gilmor, a red herring to the story. Cliff Simon, flown in from L.A. for a day's work, filmed most of his scenes as Ba'al against green screen in the gateroom for a hologram feel . Bill Dow Dr. Lee was doing theater work in Vancouver during the filming of this episode, necessitating the producers to schedule around his availability. Gary Jones's character, an SG 1 semi regular technician who sported the name Norman Davis on his uniform for years, received a new name in this episode Walter Harriman . After O'Neill had referred to him as Walter in the Season 4 episode 2010 , the producers could not get clearance for a renaming into Walter Davis . The new name is based on General Hammond referring to Jones's character as Airman sounding like Harriman in the pilot episode, and SG 1 writer Joseph Mallozzi explained the resulting incongruity as a married name issue. One scene in Zero Hour features Pierre Bernard, a graphic designer for the NBC show Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as technician O'Brien. The SG 1 producers saw Bernard ranting on Late Night about Stargate SG 1 being better without Daniel Jackson actor Michael Shanks was not part of SG 1 during Season 6 , and gave him a cameo spot. Producer Robert C. Cooper was satisfied with Zero Hour , claiming that Richard Dean Anderson is fantastic in this episode. It's new yet classic O'Neill and fans of the character will be forever pleased with this. When Zero Hour first aired on the Sci Fi Channel on July 30, 2004, it achieved a 2.2 Household rating, equaling approximately 3 million viewers. Tied with Icon , this marked the sixth highest rating for any Season 8 episode of Stargate SG 1. DVD Talk called Zero Hour a playful episode with a funny sub plot involving an alien plant , but recognized the episode's contribution to the overall story arc. TV Zone considered the plant threat a nice change but regretted that it was only a red herring for a later plot revelation. Bringing the plants to the SGC at all was regarded irritating, as the obvious move doesn't make for such good drama. O'Neill acting as the new leader made the Goa'uld threat ... a laugh and an amazing change from the events from the series' early days where O'Neill took this race more seriously. The actual zero hour plot concerning the harassed O'Neill was considered a nice touch . Conan O'Brien, who had shown a clip of Pierre Bernard's scene in his late night show before the first airing, congratulated Bernard for doing a good job, and Bernard would be invited back to the Stargate SG 1 set for a scene in the 200th episode of the show.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%20Hour%20%28Stargate%20SG-1%29
"Zero Patience is a 1993 Canadian musical film written and directed by John Greyson. The film examines and refutes the urban legend of the alleged introduction of HIV to North America by a single individual, Gaetan Dugas. Dugas, better known as Patient Zero, was tagged in the popular imagination with the blame in large measure because of Randy Shilts's history of the early days of the AIDS epidemic, And the Band Played On 1987 . The film tells its story against the backdrop of a romance between a time displaced Sir Richard Francis Burton and the ghost of Zero the character is not identified by Dugas' name . Produced in partnership with the Canadian Film Centre, the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation, Zero Patience opened to mixed reviews but went on to win a number of prestigious Canadian film awards. The film has been the subject of critical attention in the context of both film theory and queer theory and is considered part of the informal New Queer Cinema movement. Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton John Robinson , following an unfortunate encounter with the Fountain of Youth in 1892, is 170 years old and living in Toronto, Canada. Burton, now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a Museum of Natural History, is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes up with the idea of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America, Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero's doctor Brenda Kamino , mother Charlotte Boisjoli and former airline colleague Mary Dianne Heatherington , who is now with ACT UP, all refuse to demonize Zero, Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi's sarcoma. He presents this preliminary version to the press. The ghost of Zero Normand Fauteux materializes at a local gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, although Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a way to make Zero appear. The two return to the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances, Zero examines some of the other exhibits including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study before finding an African green monkey, another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey Marla Lukofsky angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love. Under pressure from his director and the exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV Michael Callen , who points out that the original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out. Burton fails to complete the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains that he tried to stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes. A major subplot involves George Richardo Keens Douglas , a French teacher and former intimate of Zero's. George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and is taking a drug that is manufactured by a company that, as a member of ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him. Real life television journalist Ann Medina has a brief role as a television reporter. Co producer Louise Garfield makes a cameo appearance playing a virus, co producer Anna Stratton appears as a drug company executive and composer Glenn Schellenberg plays a bathhouse attendant. John Greyson became interested in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study which led to the popular identification of flight attendant Gaetan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffe in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals. In dedicating the film's soundtrack album to performer and AIDS activist Michael Callen and other friends they had lost to the disease, Greyson, composer Glenn Schellenberg and producers Garfield and Stratton explained their reasons for making the film. We wanted to explode the opportunistic myth of Patient Zero....More importantly, we wanted to celebrate the courage and sass of an international AIDS activist movement that has tirelessly fought for the rights of people living with AIDS. Zero Patience garnered mixed critical reaction. The Austin Chronicle cited a murky plot, frequently weak acting and often mediocre music while still praising the film's spunk, humor, enthusiasm and wit. The Washington Post compared Zero Patience unfavorably to Hollywood's big budget, big star AIDS themed film, Philadelphia, claiming that the latter's protagonist Andrew Beckett looked sick, dealt with his illness and allowed the audience to sympathize, unlike the healthy hoofers of the musical who, because they didn't look sick enough, to deny some of the grim realities of the disease. In a contrary favorable opinion, London's Time Out Film Guide praised the film for slyly inverting popular wisdom to offer a sassy commentary on the epidemic of blame and calling Zero Patience a film which engages your mind as much as your heart, and leaves you laughing. Similarly, The New York Times lauded the film's loopy buoyancy, praising the songs as a bouncy stylistic hybrid of Gilbert and Sullivan, Ringo Starr, The Kinks and the Pet Shop Boys. Zero Patience was honored as the Best Canadian Film and Best Ontario Feature at the 1993 Cinefest and was awarded a Special Jury Citation as Best Canadian Feature Film at the 1993 Festival of Festivals. Greyson dedicated his award to the memory of Jay Scott, the influential film critic who had died of AIDS a few months earlier. Director Greyson and composer Glenn Schellenberg were nominated for a 1993 Genie Award for Best Original Song for the film's theme song, Zero Patience. In examining the film from a queer theory perspective, author Michele Aaron cites Zero Patience as definitional of one of the New Queer Cinema's central attitudes, the def of cinematic convention in terms of form, content and genre. Aaron goes on to cite the film's musical format as further subvert the ways we might expect to be 'entertained' by such serious matters as AIDS, media representation, and the legacy of moralism and sexuality. Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science fights melodrama and tabloid journalism with melodrama and tabloid journalism. Not all such critical commentary has been positive, with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood who saw the film when someone very close to him was in the final stages of AIDS calling the film misguided on the levels both of conception and execution. The Zero Patience soundtrack was released in 1994. Produced by John Switzer, it includes all of the songs and several pieces of incidental music, along with two remixes of the film's title song.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%20Patience
"Zero Sum is the twenty first episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X Files. It premiered on the Fox network on April 27, 1997. It was directed by Kim Manners, and written by Frank Spotnitz and Howard Gordon. Zero Sum included appearances by William B. Davis, Laurie Holden and Morris Panych. The episode helped to explore the overarching mythology, or fictional history of The X Files. Zero Sum earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.7, being watched by 18.6 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode has received mixed to positive responses from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. In the episode, a case Mulder is asked to investigate is covertly covered up by the agents' boss Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , who has made a sinister bargain with The Smoking Man Davis . The decision to center another episode around Skinnerfollowing the third season episode Avatar was made when Gillian Anderson took a week off to shoot the film The Mighty. Rather than have Duchovny carry the additional workload, the writing staff decided to focus the episode on supporting cast members. Zero Sum was the final appearance in the series by Morris Panych. In addition, the episode saw the return of the virus carrying bees from the season opener Herrenvolk and would later return in the 1998 feature film. At a postal routing center in Vienna, Virginia, a woman is killed by a swarm of bees in the bathroom while taking a cigarette break. Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , working for The Smoking Man William B. Davis , covers up the death by deleting the file on the case from agent Fox Mulder's David Duchovny computer, cleaning up all the evidence at the scene, burning the woman's body in an incinerator and replacing the police's blood sample for the case by impersonating Mulder. As he leaves the police station, Skinner is chased down by Detective Ray Thomas, who believes he is Mulder. Skinner tells him there is nothing on the case warranting his involvement, and leaves. Shortly after Skinner arrives home he is met by Mulder, who tells him about the case and the fact that someone is going to great lengths to cover it up. Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks Skinner. Mulder tells Skinner that Scully is undergoing tests regarding her cancer. Later that night Skinner meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man Morris Panych . Skinner is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls Skinner, telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells Skinner that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued to a federal agent or local officer. Skinner searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must have been the one used for the murder. Skinner, realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police Skinner would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up. Skinner returns to the routing center where he tears a hole in the bathroom wall and finds a large honeycomb of dead bees. He visits an entomologist to look at one of the bees and is told that Mulder visited him six months ago about a similar subject. Skinner finds Mulder's file on the matter, copying down the contact information for Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden . Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees. Skinner visits the co worker of the postal worker who died, who tells him she was pressured to not say anything about what happened by men who demanded a damaged package. At the photo lab Mulder analyzes the photo, which reveals Skinner's identity. The Smoking Man meets with the Syndicate, who are responsible for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Peyson, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result while several students are injured. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone. Co writer Frank Spotnitz described the episode as a fortunate accident . Late in the fourth season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing that they would have to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was not fair to have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi . Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner centric episode, Avatar , joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon written episode, Synchrony , was in production. The writers felt that this was the perfect time to bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man William B. Davis to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode Memento Mori . Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, The hard thing for Skinner was that we had to keep him in the middle. We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind. The writing staff felt that Zero Sum was a logical place to bring back the bees that were used in the season premiere, Herrenvolk , feeling it was important to not have something paranormal happen to Skinner in this episode considering that had been done in the previous season. Live bees were used for filming, but showed up poorly in the footage visual effects technician Laurie Kallsen George then spent nine days digitally enhancing the footage to improve upon this. The virus carrying bees would later form a central plot point in the series' 1998 feature film adaptation. Director Kim Manners noted that the episode was a really good show for me, because I had not got a chance to work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know It was really something he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too . This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode 3 . Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in Piper Maru , Avatar , Herrenvolk and Memento Mori . Zero Sum premiered on the Fox network on April 27, 1997, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on February 11, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.7 with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 11.7 percent of all television equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. A total of 18.6 million viewers watched this episode during its original airing. The episode has received mixed to positive responses from critics. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode an A, calling it utterly bad ass . Handlen felt that the episode effectively toyed with the series' usual narrative structure, making lead character Fox Mulder seem nearly as much of an antagonist as The Smoking Man Handlen also felt that Zero Sum gave significant insight into the character of Walter Skinner. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated Zero Sum one and a half stars out of four, noting that its pacing and tone are off . Vitaris felt that Duchovny and Pileggi give good performances , despite Pileggi seeming unintentionally comic at times though she noted that an episode without Scully feels pretty empty . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe A Critical Guide to The X Files, Millennium The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that Pileggi looks much more comfortable here than he did in last year's showcase 'Avatar' . Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's attempts to tie into the wider storylinesthe appearance of Marita Covarrubias in particularare where it really stumbles noting that its success lies in the shock value of seeing a deliberately familiar story through the fractured view of another character .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero%20Sum%20%28The%20X-Files%29
"Tropical Storm Zeta was a very late developing tropical storm over the central Atlantic that formed after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had officially ended on November 30 and continued into January 2006. Becoming a tropical depression at approximately midnight on December 30 UTC , it became the record breaking thirtieth tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and after intensifying into Tropical Storm Zeta six hours later, it became the season's twenty seventh named storm. Zeta was one of only two Atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years the other being Hurricane Alice in 195455 . Zeta originated from an area of low pressure on December 29, which previously developed within an upper level trough. After becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. Like the previous tropical cyclone, Hurricane Epsilon, Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on January 2, 2006, before degenerating into a remnant low on January 6 and dissipating on the next day. Since Zeta never approached land, there was no impact from the storm other than minor shipping problems. Several ships encountered the storm, and several crews in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds. Tropical Storm Zeta originated from an upper level trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late December 2005. By December 28, the trough had developed into a low pressure area roughly 750 mi 1,210 km west northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The following day, a low level circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low. By December 30, sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the National Hurricane Center NHC to classify it as a tropical cyclone. Over the following several hours, convective banding developed around the storm's center and by 0600 UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeta, the record 28th tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Operationally, however, the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on Zeta until 1700 UTC. Traveling slowly northwestward in response to a mid level low to the southwest, the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable anticyclonic outflow. By the afternoon of December 30, dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm and dissipating within three days. The following day, a mid level ridge to the north caused Zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper level westerlies. By this time, the storm attained winds of 60 mph 95 km h but increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized, resulting in a brief weakening period. Despite the shear, the shallow structure of Zeta allowed convection to regenerate and the storm gradually re intensified. Around 1800 UTC on January 1, 2006, Zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a barometric pressure of 994 mbar hPa 29.35 inHg roughly 1,035 mi 1,665 km northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. By January 2, the storm began tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid level trough located east of the storm. Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening. The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error. Zeta continued to move west northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and degenerated into a remnant later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for another day, before it dissipated 660 miles 1060 km southeast of Bermuda on January 7. Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta. Several teams encountered winds up to 50 mph 85 km h and large swells up to 12 ft 3.7 m . Although battered by torrential rain and high winds, the direction of the winds assisted some of the ships in the race by speeding them closer to Antigua. One Welsh vessel was blown 25 mi 40 km off course, ending with an encounter with a 12 ft 3.7 m shark that battered their boat. The ship Liberty Star made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40 mph 65 km h winds early on December 31, when the ship was about 45 miles 75 km north of the storm. When Zeta formed at 0600 UTC on December 30, it became the second latest forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic. Only Hurricane Alice of December 1954 formed later than Zeta, becoming a tropical storm around 1200 UTC. Additionally, Zeta became the second known Atlantic tropical cyclone, along with Alice, to exist in two calendar years. Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty eight, seven more than the previous record held by the 1933 season NHC forecaster James Franklin noted that the atmosphere seem to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam . Although the storm affected several vessels during its existence, no land areas were threatened by Zeta. As a result, the NHC did not issue any tropical storm watches or warnings.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Zeta

She has represented her country a total of 382 times in which she won six European titles, was the runner up at 2010 and 2014 World Championships, won silver medals at the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games in Beijing and 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, and won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, for which President Joachim Gauck awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt Silver Laurel Leaf . Following the Rio 2016 Paralympic Game, Zehen retired from wheelchair basketball to pursue alternative sporting challenges as an individual athlete. Zeyen was born on 17 February 1985. She is nicknamed Anni . At the age of 14, she was involved in a serious horse riding accident that left her paralysed. During rehab, she was introduced to the sport of wheelchair basketball. She left the hospital and started looking for a club where she could play. Zeyen joined ASV Bonn, initially playing with the youth team, then with the seconds, and finally with the firsts. In 2001, she played in the German Championships for Women, and was named most valuable young player. In 2004, she switched to RSV Lahn Dill, with which she won several German championships. She was invited to try out for the national team, and joined its development squad. She competed in her first paralympic games, the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. She subsequently played for the national team that won the European championships in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In September 2008, Zeyen participated in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, but Germany was beaten in the gold medal match by the United States team, which contained three of her former team mates from the University of Alabama, Stephanie Wheeler, Mary Allison Milford and Alana Nichols. The German team took home Paralympic silver medals instead. After the Paralympics, the team's performance was considered impressive enough for it to be named the national Team of the Year , and it received the Silver Laurel Leaf, Germany's highest sporting honour, from German President Horst Koehler. Zeyen took up a scholarship to the University of Alabama in 2009, majoring in advertising and minoring in graphic design. She maintained a 4.0 grade point average.

"Zeynab Begum Persian died 31 May 1640 , the fourth daughter of Safavid king shah Tahmasp I r. 15241576 , is considered to be one of the most influential princesses of the Safavid era. She lived during the reigns of five successive Safavid monarchs, and, apart from holding diverse functions, including at the top of the empire's bureaucratic system, she was also the leading matriarch in the royal harem for many years, and acted on occasion as kingmaker. She reached the apex of her influence during the early reign of King Safi r. 16291649 . In numerous contemporaneous sources, she was praised as a mainstay of political moderation and wisdom in Safavid court politics . Zeynab Begum was born to one of Tahmasp's Georgian wives, a princess named Huri Khan Khanum. Her date of birth is unknown. At a young age, Zeynab Begum was assigned a guardian laleh , Shah Qoli Beg, a high ranking member of the Shamlu Qizilbash faction. When her father died in 1576 and was succeeded by Ismail II r. 15761577 , she was given in marriage to Ali Qoli Khan Shamlu, a grandson of Durmish Khan Shamlu. The marriage took place not long before 7 December 1577, but it was apparently never consummated, for Zeynab Begum continued to live in the royal harem in the Safavid capital of Qazvin. She played a pivotal role by her support of her nephew, heir apparent Hamzeh Mirza. According to a report by Iskander Beg Munshi, Zeynab Begum stood at the head of the royal harem during the frantic civil war that had engulfed the empire in the late 1580s, amidst the Ottoman Safavid War of 15781590. In the period after Hamzeh Mirza's assassination in late 1586, she was assisted by her personal vizier, Mirza Lotfollah Shirazi, who later became grand vizier of the entire state. Thereafter, she functioned as one of the most important supporters of the young prince Abbas later known by his regnal name of Abbas I r. 15881629 during the war of succession that had commenced during the last few years of King Mohammad Khodabanda r. 15781587 . In the first years of Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum continued to be a close confidant and acted, according to the Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, as his foster mother. Even after these years, for as much as the first two decades of his reign, Zeynab Begum functioned as one of Abbas's key counselors . She continued to be the leading matriarch in the harem, and she oversaw the upbringing of Abbas's sons. It appears that local governors and military chiefs asked her for political intervention on their behalf with Abbas I. During Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum was intimately bound to the various administrative affairs of the crown khasseh sector within the Safavid bureaucracy. Between 15921593 and 16131614, she functioned as the governor of the crown sector of Kashan, and had two bureaucrats who acted as her deputies. During these years, she reportedly owned several villages in the southern outskirts of the city of Yazd. This allowed her, for most of Abbas's reign, to collect the poll tax imposed on the domain's Zoroastrian community, and to keep it for herself. Thanks to these monies, she was able to build at least one caravanserai along the Isfahan Kashan route in 16011602. A year later, she was given the post of the keeper of the seal used for all the royal decrees issued by the empire mohrdar e sharaf nafadh . In 1605, during the Ottoman Safavid War of 16031618, she advised Abbas to attack the Ottomans at Sufian this would result in one of his greatest military victories. She was on occasion included in the highest advisory body, the Council of State in 1606, she was the only woman at the briefing. According to the Portuguese diplomat Antonio de Gouvea, She made it very apparent that she deserved the honour . Several years later, in 16111612, she stood at the head of the royal banquet given on the occasion of the arrival of Wali Mohammad Khan, the Uzbek ruler of Urgench, who had fled to the Safavid realm following an outbreak of civil war in Khwarezm. In 16131614, however, Zeynab Begum fell into disgrace. She was expelled from the harem, and all her posts were taken from her. She was subsequently banished to Qazvin, where she lived under house arrest. These events took place amidst several other purges of high ranking Safavid officials and military leaders who were present at the court in Isfahan. According to historian Fazli Khuzani, this was the result of actions made by the leading mojtahed at the Safavid court, Mir Mohammad Baqer Damad. Zeynab Begum was allowed to re enter the royal court around four years later. In his accounts, Pietro Della Valle noted that he saw her in Isfahan in 1617 in the company of the royal harem. Zeynab Begum was restored as head of the royal harem in Farahabad and Isfahan by Abbas in the spring of 1627. During Abbas's terminal illness, Zeynab Begum reportedly was in close contact with the court physicians and was responsible for the supervision of his treatment at Farahabad. When Abbas died on the morning of 19 January 1629, she personally oversaw the transfer of his remains from Farahabad to Kashan, as well as the logistics of the transfer of the royal harem from Farahabad to Isfahan. Though Zeynab Begum enjoyed numerous incidents of grand prestige and influence under Abbas, it was actually during the first few years of his successor, King Safi r. 16291642 , that she reached the apex of her influence and power. According to contemporaneous court chronicles, she played an important role in convincing Abbas on his deathbed to appoint his grandson Sam Mirza later known by his regnal name of Safi as his successor to the imperial throne. In the first few months of Safi's reign, Zeynab Begum stood on a daily basis at the head of the entire administrative organ of the country. Later in the same year, she joined Safi during the Ottoman Safavid War of 16231639. On 12 February 1632, during the widespread bloody purges initiated by Safi, he ordered Zeynab Begum to move from Isfahan to Qazvin, banishing her from the court. This marked the end of Zeynab Begum's illustrious and privileged position. According to a contemporaneous report, she spent her last days in Isfahan. She was succeeded as the leading matriarch in the royal harem by Dilaram Khanum, widow of Mohammad Baqer Mirza. Zeynab Begum died on 31 May 1640 in Qazvin and was buried in the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynab%20Begum
"ZH1 was the lead ship of her class of four destroyers built for the Royal Netherlands Navy in the late 1930s. Originally named Gerard Callenburgh, the ship was scuttled while still incomplete by the Dutch during the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, but she was salvaged by the Germans a few months later and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine German Navy in 1942 as ZH1. After many delays, the ship was transferred to France in late 1943 where she escorted Axis blockade runners and submarines through the Bay of Biscay. After the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, she was one of the few remaining destroyers in French waters and they were ordered to attack the invasion shipping off the beaches. During the Battle of Ushant several days later, ZH1 was crippled and scuttled to prevent her capture, most of her crew being rescued by the Allies. The latest Japanese destroyers far outclassed the Royal Netherlands Navy's existing Admiralen class destroyers when the Gerard Callenburgh class destroyers were designed in the mid 1930s with assistance from the British company, Yarrow Shipbuilders. In response to the threat they were larger, faster and more heavily armed than the older ships. They did retain the floatplane carried by the Admiralen class for reconnaissance purposes. ZH1 had an overall length of 106.7 metres 350 ft 1 in and was 105.2 metres 345 ft 2 in long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 10.6 metres 34 ft 9 in , and a maximum draught of 3.52 metres 11 ft 7 in . She displaced 1,604 long tons 1,630 t at standard load and 2,228 long tons 2,264 t at deep load. The two geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce 45,000 shaft horsepower 34,000 kW using steam provided by six water tube boilers for a designed speed of 36 knots 67 km h 41 mph . ZH1 reached 37.5 knots 69.5 km h 43.2 mph from 53,000 shp 40,000 kW during her sea trials. The ship carried a maximum of 520 tonnes 512 long tons of fuel oil which gave a range of 2,700 nautical miles 5,000 km 3,100 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph . Her crew consisted of 12 officers and 218 sailors. The ship carried five 12 centimetre 4.7 in QF Mk 8 guns in two twin gun turrets, fore and aft of the superstructure and a single gun mount positioned on top of the rear deckhouse, superimposed over the rear turret. ZH1's anti aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 centimetre 1.5 in SK C 30 guns in two twin mounts and four 2 centimetre 0.8 in C 38 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above water 53.3 centimetre 21 in torpedo tubes in two power operated mounts. She had four depth charge launchers and rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 24 mines. The ship was laid down as Gerard Callenburgh on 12 October 1938 at the Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij RDM shipyard in Rotterdam and launched a year later. While she was still fitting out, Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and the Royal Netherlands Navy decided to scuttle her to prevent her from falling into German hands five days later. The Germans, however, refloated the ship on 14 July and towed her to the Blohm Voss shipyard in Hamburg for repair on 11 October, renaming her ZH1. The Kriegsmarine did not make many modifications as they wished to compare the ship to their own designs, retaining the main armament, propulsion machinery, and the gun and torpedo fire control systems, despite the criticism of the latter systems. They did replace the original anti aircraft armament of four 40 millimetre 1.6 in Bofors guns and four 12.7 millimetre 0.5 in anti aircraft machineguns with German weapons. She was towed back to RDM for completion and was commissioned after many delays on 11 October 1942. ZH1 sailed for the Baltic Sea on the 25th to begin working up. The ship began a brief refit in Hamburg on 18 January 1943. She collided with the Danish cargo ship Douro on 11 April, but was only lightly damaged. While under repair in June, ZH1 was further damaged during air raids on the dockyard, delaying the completion of her repairs, and she was not deemed combat worthy until October. During this time she was fitted with a FuMO 24 25 radar set above the bridge. On 31 October ZH1 and the destroyer Z27 departed Kiel for France. During the voyage to Le Verdon sur Mer, both ships were slightly damaged by splinters from British coastal artillery as they passed through the English Channel. On 5 November they were unsuccessfully attacked by British motor torpedo boats off Cap d'Antifer, damaging several of their assailants. Now assigned to the 8. Zerstorerflotille 8th Destroyer Flotilla , the ship was one of the escorts for the 6,951 gross register ton GRT blockade runner MV Osorno through the Bay of Biscay, but salinity problems in her condensers forced her turbines to be shut down on 26 December and she had to be towed to port by the torpedo boat T25. Repairs were not finished until March 1944. Early that month ZH1, the destroyer Z23, and the torpedo boats T27 and T29 escorted the Japanese submarine I 29 to Lorient. Later that month the ships escorted U boats through the Bay of Biscay. After word of the Allied landings at Normandy on 6 June was received by Kapitan zur See Captain Theodor von Bechtolsheim, commander of the 8. Zerstorerflottile, ordered his three remaining destroyers, ZH1, Z24, Z32, and the torpedo boat T24, to sail for Brest, France to begin operations against the invasion fleet. They were attacked by Beaufighters during their journey, with Z32 damaged by a pair of rockets and one aircraft forced to ditch. By this time, ZH1's armament had already been increased to four quadruple 2 cm mounts. On the night of 8 9 June, the four ships set out from Brest for Cherbourg, but were intercepted by eight Allied destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla in the Battle of Ushant. The German ships had been spotted first and the British opened fire first, with the Germans responding with a four torpedo salvo from each destroyer that missed when the Allied ships turned to evade them. The British fire was extremely effective with ZH1 badly damaged by HMS Ashanti and HMS Tartar only moments after firing her first salvo. The most damaging hit was one that severed the main steam line in the engine room and another that flooded the forward boiler room, knocking out all power. The two British destroyers then shifted their fire to Z24 and lost track of ZH1 in the darkness. They later fired at Z32 which, in turn, engaged Tartar and set her aflame. Ashanti was preparing to turn to engage Z32 when ZH1 drifted into the area and fired at Tartar with her rear guns in manual mode. Ashanti then torpedoed ZH1, blowing off her bow despite this, her forward turret continued to fire at the British ship. ZH1 also fired off her remaining torpedoes one at a time under manual control, missing with all four. Her situation hopeless, her captain ordered her crew to abandon ship and rigged depth charges to scuttle the ship at 4852N 428W 48.867N 4.467W 48.867 4.467Coordinates 4852N 428W 48.867N 4.467W 48.867 4.467. Three officers and thirty six crewmen were killed during the battle. One boat with a single officer and twenty seven men reached the French coast and the British rescued one hundred and forty men.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20destroyer%20ZH1
"Zhang Hu c. 792 c. 853 was a Chinese poet of the mid Tang dynasty. His courtesy name was Chengji. After travelling to the capital of Chang'an, Zhang was unsuccessful in seeking a position at court. He spent the latter half of his life travelling to famous places and composing poetry. The majority of his surviving poems are on historical topics and famous places he visited in his travels. Zhang Hu was born in 792, in Qinghe modern Qinghe County, Hebei or Shandong or possibly Nanyang modern Nanyang, Henan . His courtesy name was Chengji. Zhang flourished between 820 and 845. Living early on in Gusu, in the Changqing era 821824 he was summoned to the capital Chang'an on the recommendation of Linghu Chu. Linghu had known Zhang through the 810s, and his recommendation memorial was submitted along with 300 of Zhang's poems. However, he failed to find employment at court due to the opposition of Yuan Zhen, who claimed Zhang lacked literary talent. Zhang moved to Huainan, where he spent his days visiting famous temples and places of scenic beauty and devoting himself to poetry composition. Later, Zhang retired to Danyang modern Danyang, Jiangsu , where spent the rest of his days as a private citizen. He likely died in 852 or 853. Roughly 350 of Zhang's poems have survived, most of which are based on famous temples and places of scenic beauty that he visited in his travels. He primarily wrote quatrains on historical topics. There is an anthology of his poetry called the Zhang Chushi Shiji simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin Zhang Chushi Shiji WadeGiles Chang2 Ch'u3shih4 Shih2chi1 literally 'Collection of Poems by Retired Scholar Zhang' .

"Coordinates 371708N 1121615E 37.28556N 112.27083E 37.28556 112.27083 Zhenguo Temple Chinese is a Buddhist temple located 10 km from Pingyao in the village of Hadongcun, in Shanxi Province, China. The temple's oldest hall, the Wanfo Hall, was built in 963 during the Northern Han dynasty, and is notable for featuring very large brackets that hold up the roof and flying eaves. The sculptures inside the hall are among the only examples of 10th century Buddhist sculpture in China. The history of the temple begins in 963, when it was recorded that Ten Thousand Buddha Hall Wanfo dian was built. The date is written on a beam in the hall, and is also the date given by a local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century. A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date. Wanfo Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple, and is the only surviving building that dates from the short lived Northern Han dynasty. Although little is known of the temple's history, stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816. In 1997, along with Pingyao city and Shuanglin Temple, the Zhenguo temple was inscribed on the World Heritage list as Ancient City of Pingyao. The temple contains two main halls and a gate, with two courtyards in between the three buildings. There is a wall surrounding the entire complex. The temple opens to the south, with the Tianwang Hall acting as the temples gate. The next hall, to the north, is the Ten Thousand Buddha Hall, and the final hall is called Sanfo Hall , which dates from the Qing Dynasty. The northern courtyard also features two minor halls facing to the east and west called the Guanyin and Dizang Halls , which both date from the Ming Dynasty. There are also two bell towers located on either side of the Tianwang Hall. The most important hall in the temple is Ten Thousand Buddha Hall Wanfo dian , one of China's oldest wooden buildings. It is a three bay single eaves hip and gabled hall that is nearly square in shape, measures 11.6 by 10.8 meters, and is 8.8 m high. Despite the building's small size, and features that would identify it as a regular hall such as pillars that have been implanted directly into the floor instead of on a stone pedestal , the structure is quite complex. There are doors at the front and back of the hall. In addition, the front of the hall has two windows on either side of the door. There are twelve pillars supporting the structure. The corner and column top brackets holding up the roof are of the 7th degree, one of the most complex and large types according to Yingzao Fashi. These bracket sets are nearly 2.5 meters high 70 the height of the columns. Inter columnar brackets that occur between every two pillars are of the 5th degree. The hall has no ceiling, and the upper and lower set of rafters are exposed. Nancy Steinhardt speculates that the complex brackets on what would have been a humble structure were an attempt by the Northern Han rulers to build a magnificent structure with limited resources. The hall contains eleven sculptures from the Northern Han period. These are the only Chinese sculptures from the period that survive from outside the Mogao Grottoes. There is a main statue of Sakyamuni flanked by Bodhisattvas and the Heavenly Kings.

"Zhiyuan Chinese pinyin Zhiyuan WadeGiles Chih Yuen was a cruiser built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was built by Armstrong Whitworth in Elswick, England. She was one of two Zhiyuen class protected cruisers built, alongside her sister ship Jingyuen. Zhiyuan was armed with a smaller number of large sized naval guns, as opposed to later ships of this type such as the British Pearl class which carried a larger number of smaller guns. This was because the medium calibre quick firing gun had yet to be introduced, thus a warship's firepower at the time was largely a function of individual shell weight rather than volume of fire. Both ships were assigned to the Beiyang Fleet, and she was captained by Deng Shichang throughout her life. She was part of a flotilla which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuan's sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent story of her captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16 year search. At the time that Zhiyuan was ordered in October 1885, there was a debate in naval circles over the differences between armored cruisers and protected cruisers. Viceroy of Zhili province, Li Hongzhang, was in Europe to order ships from builders in Western nations. He was unable to decide between the two types, so in an experiment, he placed orders for two vessels of each type. The order for the two Zhiyuen class cruiser protected cruisers was given to Armstrong Whitworth in Elswick, England, known as the leading builder of this type of vessels during this period. Zhiyuen was 268 feet 82 metres long overall. She had a beam of 38 ft 12 m and a draught of 15 ft 4.6 m . Zhiyuen displaced 2,300 long tons 2,300 tonnes , and carried a crew of 204260 officers and enlisted men. She was equipped with an internal protective armoured deck, which was 4 inches 10 centimetres thick on the slopes and 3 in 7.6 cm on the flat. The superstructure was divided into watertight compartments, and had a raised forecastle and poop, a single funnel, and two masts. She was powered by a compound expansion steam engine with four boilers, driving two screws. This provided 6,850 indicated horsepower 5,110 kW for a top speed of 18.5 knots 34.3 km h 21.3 mph . The ship was equipped with electrics and hydraulics throughout, which included the movement of the shot from the ammunition lockers to the guns. Earlier protected cruisers, such as the Chinese cruiser Chaoyong had been equipped with a small number of 10 in 25 cm main guns but, although larger than this ship, Zhiyuen was built with a higher freeboard to improve her seaworthiness over the smaller vessel. The resultant topweight considerations resulting from the desire to mount the main armament atop the forecastle and poop necessitated that she be armed with slightly smaller and thus lighter main guns than the Chaoyong. The main armament consisting of three breech loading 8 in 20 cm Krupp guns, two paired on a hydraulics powered rotating platform in front of the ship and a single gun mounted on a manual rotating platform in the stern, was still a powerful armament for a cruiser of her size. Both mounts were protected by 2 inches 5.1 cm thick gun shields. The secondary armament consisted of two 6 in 15 cm Armstrong guns mounted on sponsons on either side of the deck, compared to the four limited traverse 4.7 inch breech loading guns carried by the Chaoyong. The ship also had eight QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss guns on Vavasseur mountings, two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns and eight 1 pounder guns to supplement her main guns in attack or for close range torpedo defence. Zhiyuen was also equipped with weapons other than naval artillery, which included six gatling guns as well as four above water mounted torpedo tubes. One pair of the torpedo tubes was mounted forward, and another pair mounted aft where they were activated using electricity from the captain's cabin. Following the orders for the two protected cruisers by Li Hongzhang in October 1885, Zhiyuan was laid down later that month on 20 October. Construction continued throughout 1886, with the ship launched on 29 September. She was officially completed on 23 July 1887. Both Zhiyuan and her sister ship was Jingyuen were laid down at the same time, but despite Zhiyuen being launched six weeks earlier than Jingyuan, she was completed two weeks later than her sister. Following completion, both ships, along with the two armored cruisers Jingyuan and Laiyuan, as well as a newly built Chinese torpedo boat, converged in the solent near Portsmouth in August 1887. Imperial Chinese Admiral William M. Lang, formerly of the Royal Navy, was sent back to Europe to take command of the squadron as they travelled to China. With the exception of a handful of Western advisors, the ships were manned by Chinese crews. Zhiyuen was under the command of Captain Deng Shichang. While in the Solent, they were inspected by Hongzhang. It had been anticipated that they would immediately be underway for the passage to China, but following the loss of an anchor and some urgent repairs, they left on 12 September. They arrived in Amoy now Xiamen in November, where they remained during the winter before joining up with the Beiyang Fleet in Shanghai in the spring. During 1888, Zhiyuen was repainted along with the rest of the Chinese Navy, changing from the all grey scheme she had sailed from England with, to a combination of a black hull, white above the waterline and buff coloured funnels, typical of the Victorian era. In May 1889, Zhiyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved to fortify Weihaiwei now Weihai . During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo now Yantai , Chemlupo now Incheon, South Korea , and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok. On the return leg of the journey, they stopped at Fusan now Busan, South Korea . Zhiyuen first saw action during one of the opening engagements of the First Sino Japanese War, in the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894. Each Chinese ship was paired with another in a supporting role in case of a signalling failure, with Zhiyuen and her sister ship grouped together. Shortly after the start of the battle, Admiral Ruchang's signalling mast aboard Dingyuan was disabled by its own weapons. This meant that the entire Chinese fleet operated in these pairs throughout the battle without any central organisation. By 2 00 pm, Zhiyuen was engaged with the corvette Hiei, it having been left behind by the faster vessels of the main Japanese formation. Hiei broke from the engagement to pass directly between the two Dingyuan class ironclads Dingyuan and Zhenyuan in an attempt to catch up with the other members of the formation, being greatly damaged in the process. A squadron of Japanese vessels consisting of the cruisers Yoshino, Takachiho, Akitsushima, and Naniwa operated together throughout the battle. As mid afternoon approached, the squadron turned their attention to Zhiyuan and her sister ship the faster Japanese vessels circled the Chinese pair, raking them with fire. She began listing to starboard, having started taking on water from a hole in the hull. Captain Deng gave the order for the ship to ram a Japanese cruiser, but as she closed, a hit by a 10 in 25 cm shell on one of Zhiyuan's torpedo tubes caused an explosion she sank at around 3 30 pm. Alternative reports have suggested that Zhiyuan was actually torpedoed. Of the 246 officers and men on board, only seven survived. American Philo McGiffin, who was on board Zhenyuan, reported after the battle that there had been a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died. The story of Deng's order to ram the Yoshino and his subsequent refusal to leave his ship as it sank has resulted in him being placed in popular culture as a national hero, particularly following the formation of the People's Republic of China. Deng, and the events on the Zhuyuan are repeated in school textbooks in China, where they praise his actions while also criticising Li Hongzhang. The People's Liberation Army Navy training ship Shichang, was named after Deng. As a result, Zhiyuan has received many mentions and appearances in historical reenactments, such as the 1962 Changchun Film Studio movie Naval Battle of 1894 which concentrated on Deng's actions in the Battle of the Yalu River. This particular film ends in a sequence wherein Zhiyuan attempts to ram the Yoshino, before cutting to waves hitting rocks on a shoreline with Deng's face superimposed. Deng and the Zhiyuan appeared in the 2003 Chinese television series Towards the Republic, in which he was described as a strict but honourable captain whose ship's company respects him and his authority. To commemorate this period of history, in 2014, China invested 37 million yuan to construct a replica Zhiyuan under construction at the Port of Dandong, near to the mouth of the Yalu River. The construction of the replica was undertaken by Dandong Shipbuilding Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. at the same scale as the original. The new Zhiyuan will be a floating museum. Inside will be artifacts and records of Zhiyuan, the Beiyang Fleet, the First Sino Japanese War and life at sea exhibits. From 1997 onwards, there has been attempts to locate the wreckage of the Zhiyuan. During a dredging process near the mouth of the Yalu discovered hull fragments from the Chinese vessels. In 2013, a shipwreck was discovered near Dandong Port and subsequently code named Dandong No 1 . After an almost two year long investigation, it was officially confirmed as the wreck of Zhiyuan. Further excavation work then ensued 59 kilometres 37 mi south of the Yalu. Over 100 items have since been salvaged from Zhiyuan, including weapons, parts of the ship and items relate do the daily life of the crew. A broken china plate bearing the name of Zhiyuan was found, which helped to identify the vessel. Naval historian Chen Yue stressed the importance of finding common living items to those researching the Sino Japanese War and expressed a high hope of discovering the official seal of the vessel. He said, The ship seal was invariably made of good materials and stored in a sturdy box. It is highly possible that we can find it. During the excavation, the bodies of seven of the crew were recovered. The idea of floating the wreck were initially discounted due to the risk of structural collapse, but plans to raise the vessel have not yet been finalised. It is intended for the artifacts to be displayed at a new museum, located in nearby Dandong.

"Chinese Civil War Second Sino Japanese War Zhu De du de also Chu Teh 1 December 1886 6 July 1976 was a Chinese general, warlord, politician, revolutionary and one of the pioneers of the Communist Party of China. Born poor in 1886 in Sichuan, he was adopted by a wealthy uncle at age nine this prosperity provided him a superior early education that led to his admission into a military academy. After his time at the academy, he joined a rebel army and soon became a warlord. It was after this period that he adopted communism. He ascended through the ranks of the Chinese Red Army as it closed in on securing the nation. By the time China was under Mao's control, Zhu was a high ranking official within the Communist Party of China. He served as Commander in Chief of the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino Japanese War. In 1955 he became one of the Ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army, of which he is regarded as the principal founder. Zhu remained a prominent political figure until his death in 1976. As the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress from 1975 to 1976, Zhu was the head of state of the People's Republic of China. Zhu was born on December 1, 1886, to a poor tenant farmer's family in Hung, a town in Yilong County, a hilly and isolated part of northern Sichuan province. Of the 15 children born to the family only eight survived. His family relocated to Sichuan during the migration from Hunan province and Guangdong province. His origins are often given as Hakka, but Agnes Smedley's biography of him says his people came from Guangdong and speaks of Hakka as merely associates of his. She also says that older generations of his family had spoken the Kwangtung dialect which would be close to but probably different from modern Cantonese and that his generation also spoke the Szechwan dialect Sichuanese, a distinct regional variant of Southwest Mandarin that is unintelligible to other speakers of Standard Chinese Mandarin . In spite of the family's poverty, by pooling resources Zhu was chosen to be sent to a regional private school in 1892. At age nine he was adopted by his prosperous uncle, whose political influence allowed him to gain access to Yunnan Military Academy. He enrolled in a Sichuan high school around 1907 and graduated in 1908. Subsequently, he returned to Yilong's primary school as a gym instructor. An advocate of modern science and political teaching rather than the strict classical education afforded by schools, he was dismissed from his post and entered the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming. There he joined the Beiyang Army and the Tongmenghui secret political society the forerunner of the Kuomintang . It was at the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming that he first met Cai E Tsai Ao . He taught at the Academy after his graduation in July 1911. Siding with the revolutionary forces after the Chinese Revolution, he joined Brig. Cai E in the October 1911 expeditionary force that marched on Qing forces in Sichuan. He served as a regimental commander in the campaign to unseat Yuan Shikai in 1915 16. When Cai became governor of Sichuan after Yuan's death in June 1916, Zhu was made a brigade commander. Following the death of his mentor Cai E and of his first wife Xiao Jufang in 1916, Zhu developed a severe opium habit that afflicted him for several years until 1922, when he underwent treatment in Shanghai. His troops continued to support him, and so he consolidated his forces to become a warlord. In 1920, after his troops were driven from Sichuan toward the Tibetan border, he returned to Yunnan as a public security commissioner of the provincial government. Around this time he decided to leave China for study in Europe. He first traveled to Shanghai, where he broke his opium habit and, according to historians of the Kuomintang, met Dr. Sun Yat sen. He attempted to join the Chinese Communist Party in early 1922, but was rejected for being a warlord. In late 1922 Zhu went to Berlin, along with his partner He Zhihua. He resided in Germany until 1925, studying at one point at Gottingen University. Here he met Zhou Enlai and was expelled from Germany for his role in a number of student protests. Around this time he joined the Communist Party of China Zhou Enlai was one of his sponsors having sponsors being a condition of probationary membership, the stage before actual membership . In July 1925, after being expelled from Germany, he traveled to the Soviet Union to study military affairs and Marxism at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. While in Moscow He Zhihua gave birth to his only daughter, Zhu Min. Zhu returned to China in July 1926 to unsuccessfully persuade Sichuan warlord Yang Sen to support the Northern Expedition. In 1927, following the collapse of the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First United Front military institute in Nanchang. Zhu's close affiliation with Mao Zedong began in 1928 when, under the assistance of Chen Yi and Lin Biao, Zhu defected from Fan Shisheng's protection and marched his army of 10,000 men to Jiangxi and the Jinggang Mountains. Here Mao had formed a soviet in 1927, and Zhu began building up his army into the Red Army, consolidating and expanding the Soviet areas of control. The meeting, which happened on the Longjiang Bridge on April 28, 1928, was facilitated by Mao Zetan, who was Mao's brother serving under Zhu. He carried a letter to his brother Mao Zedong where Zhu stated, We must unite forces and carry out a well defined military and agrarian policy. This development became a turning point, with the merged forces forming the Fourth Red Army , with Zhu as Military Commander and Mao as Party representative. Zhu's leadership made him a figure of immense prestige locals even credited him with supernatural abilities. During this time Mao and Zhu became so closely associated that to the local villagers they were known collectively as Zhu Mao In 1929, Zhu De and Mao Zedong were forced to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin following military pressure from Chiang Kai shek. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers 11,584 square miles and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign However, he was not able to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 break out that began the Long March. During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai organized certain battles in tandem. There were few positive effects since the real power was in the hands of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedongs criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao. During the Second Sino Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, he held the position of Commander in Chief of the Red Army and, in 1940, Zhu, alongside Peng Dehuai, devised and organized the Hundred Regiments Offensive. Initially, Mao supported this offensive. While a successful campaign, Mao later attributed it as the main provocation for the devastating Japanese Three Alls Policy later and used it to criticize Peng at the Lushan Conference. In 1949 Zhu was named Commander in Chief of the People's Liberation Army PLA it is in this way posterity regards him as a principal founder of the PLA. He also served as the Vice Chairman of the Communist Party 19561966 and Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China 19541959 . Zhu oversaw the PLA during the Korean War within his authority as Commander in Chief. In 1955, he was conferred to the rank of marshal. At the Lushan Conference, he tried to protect Peng Dehuai, by giving some mild criticisms of Peng rather than denouncing him, he merely gently reproofed his targeted comrade, who was a target of Mao Zedong. Mao wasn't satisfied with Zhu De's behavior. After the conference, Zhu was dismissed from vice chairmen of Central Military Commission, not in least part due to his loyalty for the fallen Peng. In April 1969, during the summit of the Cultural Revolution, Zhu was dismissed from his position on the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the activity of the National People's Congress was halted. However, due to the support of Zhou Enlai, he was not harmed or imprisoned. In August 1969, Lin Biao issued a command that dispatched important martial figures to distant areas due to the tension between China and Soviet Union, and Zhu De was driven to Guangzhou. In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Standing Committee. He continued to be a prominent elder statesman until his death how on 6 July 1976. His passing came six months after the death of Zhou Enlai, and just two months before the death of Mao Zedong. Zhu was cremated three days later, and received a funeral days afterwards. Zhu De was legally married four times, according to the unfinished biography written by Agnes Smedley however, there is no evidence of his marrying the mother of his only daughter.

"The Zhuangzi Mandarin wa.ts historically romanized Chuang Tzu is an ancient Chinese text from the late Warring States period 476221 BC which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal Daoist sage. Named for its traditional author, Master Zhuang Zhuangzi , the Zhuangzi isalong with the Tao Te Chingone of the two foundational texts of Taoism, and is generally considered the most important of all Daoist writings. The Zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature. Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions. The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other ancient Chinese philosophers focused on moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with the Way Dao by following nature. Though primarily known as a philosophical work, the Zhuangzi is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history, and has been called the most important pre Qin text for the study of Chinese literature. A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty 206 BCAD 220 to the present. Many major Chinese writers and poets in historysuch as Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties 222589 , Li Bai during the Tang dynasty 618907 , and Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty 9601279 were heavily influenced by the Zhuangzi. The Zhuangzi is named for and attributed to Zhuang Zhouusually known as Zhuangzi , from the Mandarin Chinese Zhuangzi meaning Master Zhuang a man generally said to have been born around 369 BC at a place called Meng in the state of Song around present day Shangqiu, Henan Province , and to have died around 301, 295, or 286 BC. Almost nothing is concretely known of Zhuangzi's life. He is thought to have spent time in the southern state of Chu, as well as in Linzi, the capital of the state of Qi. Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian Shiji , the first of China's 24 dynastic histories, has a biography of Zhuangzi, but most of it seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the Zhuangzi itself. In the introduction to his Zhuangzi translation, the American scholar Burton Watson concluded his comments about the paucity of the historical information on Zhuangzi by saying Whoever Zhuang Zhou was, the writings attributed to him bear the stamp of a brilliant and original mind. Scholars have recognized since at least the Song dynasty 9601279 that some parts of the book could not have been written by Zhuangzi himself. Since ancient times, however, its first seven chaptersthe nei pian inner chapters have been considered to be the actual work of Zhuangzi, and most modern scholars agree with this view. How many, if any, of the remaining 26 chaptersthe wai pian outer chapters and za pian miscellaneous chapters were written by Zhuangzi has long been debated. It is generally accepted that the middle and later Zhuangzi chapters are the result of a subsequent process of accretion and redaction by later authors responding to the scintillating brilliance of the inner chapters. Regardless of its authorship, all of the Zhuangzi's 33 surviving chapters are accepted as compositions from the 4th to 2nd centuries BC. Details of the Zhuangzi's textual history prior to the Han dynasty 206 BC AD 220 are largely unknown. Traces of its influence in late Warring States period 475221 BC philosophical texts such as the Guanzi, Han Feizi, Huainanzi, and Lushi Chunqiu suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of Qi and Chu in the 3rd century BC. The Records of the Grand Historian refers to a 100,000 word Zhuangzi work and references several chapters that are still in the text. The Book of Han Han shu , finished in AD 111, lists a Zhuangzi in 52 chapters, which many scholars believe to be the original form of the work. A number of different forms of the Zhuangzi survived into the Tang dynasty 618907 , but a shorter and more popular 33 chapter form of the book prepared by the philosopher and writer Guo Xiang around AD 300 is the source of all surviving editions. In 742, the Zhuangzi was canonized as one of the Chinese Classics by an imperial proclamation from Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, which awarded it the honorific title True Scripture of Southern Florescence Nanhua zhenjing though most orthodox Chinese scholars did not consider the Zhuangzi to be a true classic jing due to its non Confucian nature. Portions of the Zhuangzi have been discovered among bamboo slip texts from Warring States period and Han dynasty tombs, particularly at the Shuanggudui and Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts sites. One of the slips from the Guodian bamboo texts, which date to around 300 BC, contains what appears to be a short fragment from the Ransacking Coffers Qu qie chapter. A large number of Zhuangzi fragments dating from the early Tang dynasty were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century by the expeditions of Hungarian British explorer Aurel Stein and French Sinologist Paul Pelliot. They collectively form about twelve chapters of Guo Xiang's version of the Zhuangzi, and are preserved mostly at the British Library and the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. Among the Japanese national treasures preserved in the Kozan ji temple in Kyoto is a Zhuangzi manuscript from the Muromachi period 13381573 . The manuscript has seven complete chapters from the outer and miscellaneous chapters, and is believed to be a close copy of an annotated edition written in the 7th century by the Chinese Daoist master Cheng Xuanying fl. 630660 . Vedic philosophy Mimamsa Vedanta Samkhya Yoga Nyaya Navya Nyaya Vaisheshika Nastika heterodox Tamil Other General topics Jainism Buddhism Traditions Topics Persons Topics New Confucianism Daoism Persons Topics Legalism Chinese Buddhism Hundred Schools of Thought Maoism Other General topics Topics The Zhuangzi consists of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature. Most Zhuangzi stories are fairly short and simple, such as Lickety and Split drilling seven holes in Wonton chapter 7 or Zhuangzi being discovered sitting and drumming on a basin after his wife dies chapter 18 , although a few are longer and more complex, like the story of Master Lie and the magus chapter 14 and the account of the Yellow Emperor's music chapter 14 . Unlike the other stories and allegories in other pre Qin texts, the Zhuangzi is unique in that the allegories form the bulk of the text, rather than occasional features, and are always witty, emotional, and are not limited to reality. Unlike other ancient Chinese works, whose allegories were usually based on historical legends and proverbs, most Zhuangzi stories seem to have been invented by Zhuangzi himself. Some are completely whimsical, such as the strange description of evolution from misty spray through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans chapter 18 , while a few other passages seem to be sheer playful nonsense which read like Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky . The Zhuangzi is full of quirky and fantastic characters, such as Mad Stammerer , Fancypants Scholar , Sir Plow , and a man who believes his left arm will turn into a rooster, his right arm will turn into a crossbow, and his buttocks will become cartwheels. A master of language, Zhuangzi sometimes engages in logic and reasoning, but then turns it upside down or carries the arguments to absurdity to demonstrate the limitations of human knowledge and the rational world. Some of Zhuangzi's reasoning, such as his renowned argument with his philosopher friend Huizi Master Hui about the joy of fish chapter 17 , have been compared to the Socratic and Platonic dialogue traditions, and Huizi's paradoxes near the end of the book have been termed strikingly like those of Zeno of Elea. The most famous of all Zhuangzi stories Zhuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly appears at the end of the second chapter, On the Equality of Things . ,, Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know that he was Zhuang Zhou. ,,, Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou. But he didn't know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhuang Zhou. Between Zhuang Zhou and the butterfly there must be some distinction This is called the Transformation of Things. The well known image of Zhuangzi wondering if he was a man who dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man is so striking that whole dramas have been written on its theme. In it Zhuangzi with the theme of transformation , illustrating that the distinction between waking and dreaming is another false dichotomy. If distinguishes them, how can tell if is now dreaming or awake Another well known Zhuangzi story The Death of Wonton illustrates the dangers Zhuangzi saw in going against the innate nature of things. ,,,, ,,,, The emperor of the Southern Seas was Lickety, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Split, and the emperor of the Center was Wonton. Lickety and Split often met each other in the land of Wonton, and Wonton treated them very well. Wanting to repay Wonton's kindness, Lickety and Split said, All people have seven holes for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing. Wonton alone lacks them. Let's try boring some holes for him. So every day they bored one hole , and on the seventh day Wonton died. Zhuangzi believed that the greatest of all human happiness could be achieved through a higher understanding of the nature of things, and that in order to develop oneself fully one needed to express one's innate ability. In this anecdote, Mair suggests that Zhuangzi humorously and absurdly uses Wonton a name for both the Chinese conception of primordial chaos and, by later physical analogy, wonton soupto demonstrate what he believed were the disastrous consequences of going against things' innate natures. The story of The Debate on the Joy of Fish is a well known anecdote that has been compared to the Socratic dialogue tradition of ancient Greece. , Zhuangzi and Huizi were enjoying themselves on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, The minnows are darting about free and easy This is how fish are happy. , , Huizi replied, You are not a fish. How do you know that the fish are happy Zhuangzi said, You are not I. How do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy , , Huizi said, I am not you, to be sure, so of course I don't know about you. But you obviously are not a fish so the case is complete that you do not know that the fish are happy. ,, Zhuangzi said, Let's go back to the beginning of this. You said, How do you know that the fish are happy but in asking me this, you already knew that I know it. I know it right here above the Hao. The exact point made by Zhuangzi in this debate is not entirely clear. The story seems to make the point that knowing a thing is simply a state of mind, and that it is not possible to determine if that knowing has any objective validity. This story has been cited as an example of Zhuangzi's linguistic mastery, as he subtly uses reason to make an anti rationalist point. Another well known Zhuangzi story Drumming On a Tub and Singing describes how Zhuangzi did not view death as something to be feared. ,, ,,,, Zhuangzi's wife died. When Huizi went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old, said Huizi. It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singingthis is going too far, isn't it ,,,,,,,,,, Zhuangzi said, You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter. ,,, Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. Zhuangzi seems to have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of existence and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death may in fact be better than life How do I know that loving life is not a delusion How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back His writings teach that the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness. The story of Zhuangzi's death, contained in chapter 32 of the text, exemplifies the colorful lore that grew up around Zhuangzi in the decades after his death, as well as the elaboration of the core philosophical ideas contained in the inner chapters that appears in the outer and miscellaneous chapters . , ,,, When Master Zhuang was about to die, his disciples wanted to give him a lavish funeral. Master Zhuang said I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my pair of jade disks, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, the ten thousand things as my funerary gifts. With my burial complete, how is there anything left unprepared What shall be added to it ,,, The disciples said We are afraid that the crows and kites will eat you, Master Master Zhuang said Above ground I'd be eaten by crows and kites, below ground I'd be eaten by mole crickets and ants. You rob the one and give to the otherhow skewed would that be The stories and anecdotes of the Zhuangzi embody a unique set of principles and attitudes, including living one's life with natural spontaneity, uniting one's inner self with the cosmic Way Dao , keeping oneself distant from politics and social obligations, accepting death as a natural transformation, showing appreciation and praise for things others view as useless or aimless, and stridently rejecting social values and conventional reasoning. These principles form the core ideas of philosophical Daoism. The other major philosophical schools of ancient Chinasuch as Confucianism, Legalism, and Mohismwere all concerned with concrete social, political, or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and thereby alleviate the problems and suffering of the world. However, Zhuangzi believed that the key to true happiness was to free oneself from the world and its standards through the Daoist principle of inaction wuwei action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for gainand was fundamentally opposed to systems that impose order on individuals. The Zhuangzi interprets the universe as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious God or will driving it, and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously. It argues that because of humans' advanced cognitive abilities, they have a tendency to create artificial distinctionssuch as good versus bad, large versus small, usefulness versus uselessness, and social systems like Confucianismthat remove themselves from the natural spontaneity of the universe. In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans. As Burton Watson described, the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success. The term wandering you is used throughout the stories of the Zhuangzi to describe how an enlightened person wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it. The Zhuangzi vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi seems to have felt was problematic at its foundation because of the opposition between man and nature. The text tries to show that as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness. It is unclear if Zhuangzi's positions were tantamount to anarchy, and he was by no means in favor of violence. The political references in the Zhuangzi are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what kind of government should exist. Western scholars have long noticed that the Zhuangzi is often strongly anti rationalist. Mohism, deriving from Zhuangzi's possible contemporary Mozi, was the most logically sophisticated school in ancient China. Whereas reason and logic became the hallmark of Greek philosophy and then the entire Western philosophical tradition, in China philosophers preferred to rely on moral persuasion and intuition. The Zhuangzi played a significant role in the traditional Chinese skepticism toward rationalism, as Zhuangzi frequently turns logical arguments upside down to satirize and discredit them. However, Zhuangzi did not entirely abandon language and reason, but only wished to point out that overdependence on them could limit the flexibility of thought. The Zhuangzi is by far the most influential purely literary work dating from before China's imperial unification in 221 BC. Its literary quality, imagination and creativity, and linguistic prowess were entirely unprecedented in the period of its creation. Virtually every major Chinese writer or poet in history, from Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties, Li Bai during the Tang dynasty, to Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty were deeply imbued with the ideas and artistry of the Zhuangzi. Traces of the Zhuangzi's influence in late Warring States period philosophical texts such as the Guanzi, Han Feizi, Huainanzi, and Lushi Chunqiu suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of Qi and Chu in the 3rd century BC. However, during the Qin and Han dynastieswith their state sponsored Legalist and Confucian ideologies, respectivelythe Zhuangzi does not seem to have been highly regarded. One exception is Han dynasty scholar Jia Yi's 170 BC work Fu on the Owl Funiao fu , the earliest definitively known fu rhapsody, which does not reference the Zhuangzi by name but cites it for one sixth of the poem. After the collapse of the Han dynasty in AD 207 and the subsequent chaos of the Three Kingdoms period, both the Zhuangzi and Zhuang Zhou began to rise in popularity and acclaim. The 3rd century AD poets Ruan Ji and Xi Kang, both members of the famous Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove, were ardent Zhuangzi admirers, and one of Ruan's essays, entitled Discourse on Summing Up the Zhuangzi Da Zhuang lun , is still extant. This period saw Confucianism temporarily surpassed by a revival of Daoism and old divination texts, such as the Classic of Changes I Ching , and many early medieval Chinese poets, artists, and calligraphers were deeply influenced by the Zhuangzi. The Zhuangzi has been called the most important of all the Daoist writings , and its inner chapters embody the core ideas of philosophical Daoism. In the 4th century AD, the Zhuangzi became a major source of imagery and terminology for a new form of Daoism known as the Highest Clarity Shangqing school that was popular among the aristocracy of the Jin dynasty AD 265420 . Highest Clarity Daoism borrowed notable Zhuangzi terms, such as perfected man zhen ren , Great Clarity Tai Qing , and fasting the mind xin zhai , and though they are used somewhat differently than in the Zhuangzi itself, they still show the important role the Zhuangzi played at the time. The Zhuangzi was very influential in the adaptation of Buddhism to Chinese culture after Buddhism was first brought to China from India in the 1st century AD. Zhi Dun, China's first aristocratic Buddhist monk, wrote a prominent commentary to the Zhuangzi in the mid 4th century. The Zhuangzi also played a significant role in the formation of Chan Zen Buddhism, which grew out of a fusion of Buddhist ideology and ancient Daoist thought. Among the traits Chan Zen Buddhism borrowed from the Zhuangzi are a distrust of language and logic, an insistence that the Dao can be found in everything, even dung and urine, and a fondness for dialogues based on riddles or paradigm challenging statements known as gong'an Japanese koan . The Zhuangzi retained prominence throughout Chinese history as the preeminent example of core Daoist philosophical ideals. The 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu lamented his government's flippant use of the Zhuangzi on the imperial examination essays as representative of a decline in traditional morals at the end of the Ming dynasty 13681644 . In the great Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber Hong lou meng , the main protagonist, Jia Baoyu, often turns to the Zhuangzi for comfort amidst his despair over conflicting love interests and relationships. The story of Zhuangzi drumming on a tub and singing after the death of his wife inspired an entire tradition of folk music called funeral drumming sang gu in central China's Hubei and Hunan Provinces that survived into the 18th and 19th centuries. Outside of China and the traditional Sinosphere , the Zhuangzi lags far behind the Tao Te Ching in general popularity, and is rarely known by non scholars. A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as one of the most entertaining as well as one of the profoundest books in the world. In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote I feel a sense of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi%20%28book%29
"Hans Joachim von Zieten, sometimes spelled Johann Joachim von Ziethen, 14 May 1699 26 January 1786 , also known as Zieten aus dem Busch, was a cavalry general in the Prussian Army. He served in four wars and was instrumental in several victories during the reign of Frederick the Great, most particularly at Hohenfriedberg and Torgau. He is also well known for a raid into the Holy Roman Empire during the Second Silesian War, known as Zieten's Ride. After engaging in a reputed 74 duels, and fighting in four wars, he died in his bed at the age of 86. Zieten was born on 14 May 1699 in the hamlet of Wustrau, now part of Fehrbellin, in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. His father was Joachim Matthias 16571720 and his mother, Catharine Jurgass. The family had lived there for several hundred years records show them founding a Latin School in the mid fourteenth century. The property was small and the family referred to the ramshackle house as a calliope. His father shared the property with his brother, Hans Dietrich when the brother died in 1693, the father owned the property outright, valued at 4,000 thalers. Zieten was the third of seven children by 1720, when his father died, only four children remained. Wustrau came to Zieten and his three sisters. The estate was valued at 8,000 thalers, of which the maintenance of the mother had to be fulfilled and his sisters' inheritances and dowries paid. This left Zieten with about half of the value. A neighbor, General von Schwendy of Buskow, took Zieten in 1715 as corporal in his regiment in Neuruppin. On 7 July 1722, Zieten became a cadet. Upon his appointment as governor of Spandau, Schwendy, who had been Zieten's mentor, released his regiment to command of Generalmajor Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. In a report to Frederick William I, Zieten was described as ... very small, and of weak voice for commanding. This was sufficient for the so called soldier king, who was obsessed with tall men, to overlook Zieten in the promotions lists. On 28 July 1724, Zieten journeyed from Crossen, where his regiment was garrisoned, with a petition for promotion to the King, who then wrote on the margin of the petition that Zieten shall have his dismissal. Zieten retired to his estates. Two years later, during a stay in Berlin, Zieten heard of the doubling of the dragoon regiment of Wuthenow and obtained a position as lieutenant in this regiment. In 1727, after an argument with his captain Rittmeister , he was condemned to a one year imprisonment on the fortress of Konigsberg for disobedience. After returning from the fortress, Zieten challenged the Rittmeister to a duel and he was subsequently cashiered. He returned to Wustrau. By 1730, on the recommendation of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the supposedly rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly formed Freikompanie independent company of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the Rittmeister with 50 thalers a month's salary. In summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks of arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Karoly Jozsef Batthyany, the Austrian hussars' superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry work. His next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736. In 1737 Zieten married the 33 year old Judith von Jurga. His eldest daughter came from this marriage. Shortly before the wedding, he dueled with his superintendent, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Ludwig von Wurmburg. Both were severely wounded. In 1741, at the onset of the First Silesian War War of Austrian Succession, Zieten was a major and squadron leader. On 10 May 1741 he distinguished himself in combat with the Austrians at the Battle of Strehlen. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Life hussar regiment and received the Order Pour le Merite. Zieten met his old teacher, Batthyany, during the First Silesian War and defeated him at the Battle of Rothschloss. The chivalrous Austrian sent him a complimentary letter a few days later, and General Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, who had been in command at Rothschloss, reported upon his conduct so favorably that Frederick marked him for future high command. Within a year he was colonel and proprietor of the newly formed Hussar Regiment, the Zieten Hussars, the second Hussar Regiment. In the Moravian foray of the following year, Zieten and his hussars penetrated almost to Vienna, and in the retreat to Silesia he was constantly employed with the rearguard. Although upon his rejoining the military in 1730 as a rehabilitated officer, Zieten's temperament had not wholly reformed. With several contemporaries, he maintained a running rivalry with Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, one of Frederick's trusted confidantes. It had its origins in simultaneous promotions to colonel following the Battle of Rothschloss. Although Zieten was the older in years and service, and had actually been in command at the battle, he and Winterfeldt were promoted together. Zieten resented the rapid promotion of his junior. The animosity was perpetuated by Frederick's long standing trust of Winterfeldt, who had stood by him during the Katte Affair. In the winter of 17411742, and later during the short peace between the first and second Silesian wars, Zieten was engaged in the reorganization of Prussian cavalry. In 1743 he had his family house, the old Kaluppe , demolished, and began construction of a new, stately mansion in Wustrau. During the short peace, the hussars, like the rest of the Prussian cavalry, had undergone a complete transformation. To their discipline they had added the dash and skirmishing qualities of the best irregulars, and the Prussian hussars were considered the best of their kind in Europe. In 1743 the Zieten hussars adopted the distinctive tiger skin pelisse for their parade uniforms, with company officers wearing fur caps with heron feathers and field officers using an eagles' wing. In 1744, Zieten advanced with the avant garde of the Prussian army in Bohemia to Budejovice. On his own initiative at Moldau, the colonel, with his red uniform Hussar Regiment No. 2, forced a larger enemy's force into its knees. Zieten covered the retreat behind the Elbe, and on 12 October, he fell into a violent ambush at Moldau. In this year the nickname, Zieten aus den Busch Zieten of the bush was born. On 20 May 1745, he and his hussars distinguished themselves with a daring nocturnal passage of an Austrian corps of 20,000 men. Zieten led the famous Zietenritt Zietenride around the enemy's lines to deliver the King's order to a distant detachment. Two weeks later, at Hohenfriedberg on 4 June, the Zieten Hussars distinguished themselves for the first time in a battle. before the Battle of Hennersdorf in November, the Zieten Hussars shadowed the Imperial army, waiting to pounce on them. At Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the Austro Saxons Winterfeldt arrived on the field in time to take a decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share their laurels, and Zieten actually wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. The victory at Hennersdorf ended the Second Silesian War. After the Treaty of Dresden, the daily routine of peacetime military service began to drag his spirits down. At times, the opinionated Zieten fell into disgrace with the King, who, in Zieten's opinion, did not sufficiently support him. Zieten separated himself from the court, and grumbled to Frederick from his estate. In March, 1756, his wife died and the aging general began to be plagued by the gout. Zieten was promoted to generalleutnant and took part in the Battle of Reichenberg in 1757 and again at the Battle of Prague. On 5 May 1757, he received the Order of the Black Eagle. In the Battle of Kolin he commanded the left wing and was then assigned to Duke August Wilhelm Brunswick Wolfenbuttel Bevern, who was given the command in Silesia. On 24 November 1757, he led the rest of the army past Glogau to Liegnitz to join Frederick's army he subsequently distinguished himself in the Battle of Leuthen on 5 December, by helping to run down the Austrian left flank. At the Battle of Hochkirch, his cavalry, and that of Seydlitz, provided the rear guard for the Prussian withdrawal. During the attack at Domstadt, he could not prevent the loss of a large supply convoy. During the Battle of Liegnitz on 15 August 1760, he managed to keep the Austrian main army at bay so that it could not participate in the battle. Zieten was promoted to general of cavalry. He made one of the few tactical mistakes of his career early in the Battle of Torgau, 3 November 1760, when he misdirected an attack against the Austrian troops he made up for this error when he and his hussars stormed the Suptitzer heights. Finally, it was Zieten who, in 1761, took the King out of a deep spiritual crisis while the army was entrenched at Bunzelwitz. Until the end of the war, he was repeatedly entrusted with the supreme command of the Prussian army in the absence of the king. By the end of the war, Zieten belonged to the elite of the kingdom and the inner circle of friends of the monarch. After the Seven Years' War, Zieten retired from active service, widely considered a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him to go, so he stayed on his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period she gathered his reminiscences for a biography. In the subsequent years of peace, the old army commander remained a tireless instructor of his now legendary Hussar regiment. In his last years of life, Zieten alternated between Berlin, where he bought a house in 1763 on Kochstrasse No. 6162. and on his property at Wustrau, where he devoted himself mainly to charity. At the same time, he worked with great care to improve his property. He enjoyed the special trust of Frederick, who frequently visited his old father Zieten. In one visit with the King, at Sanssouci, after a long conversation, the King ordered a chair to be placed on which he invited the 85 year old man to sit. Despite his infirmities, Zieten refused to sit in the presence of the monarch the King said Sit down, Zieten, or I will go away. On 26 January 1786, Zieten died in his bed in Berlin, a remarkable age considering his hair trigger temper and his reputed 74 duels. He was buried on 31 January 1786 on the Wustrau cemetery next to the village church. His estate was valued at 65,057 thalers. Apart from property at Wustrau, he left no fortune. The furniture of the Berlin house had to be auctioned after his death, and his widow was only freed from debt by a gift from King Frederick of ten thousand thalers. From his first marriage with Judith von Jurga 170319 March 1756 married on 5 November 1737 came a daughter, Johanna 17477 June 1829 . She married Karl von Jurga 170219 March 1756 , the son of Joachim von Jurga and Luise von Zieten. After the death of his first wife, he married on 24 August 1764 to Hedwig von Platen 17386 September 1818 . His only son, Friedrich von Zieten 6 October 176529 June 1854 , whose baptism Frederick witnessed, was first a captain of hussars and from 18001824 councilor of Ruppin. In 1840 he was raised to the nobility by Frederick William II of Prussia. He died in 1854, unmarried, and was buried in the local cemetery. With the death of the last male heir, the property and title moved from the Zieten family to the line of Schwerin, due to the marriage of one of his granddaughters, Karoline Albertine Luise Wilhelmine Emilie von Zieten 22 April 180624 February 1853 to Albert Ludwig Wilhelm von Schwerin 17 June 180127 October 1865 . Their children inherited the property and title. Another famous member of the Hussars Zieten, Hans Count von Zieten, is only remotely related to Hans Joachim. In 1794 Frederick William II placed a monument to Zieten in Berlin on the Wilhelmplatz Berlin Mitte . It was first created by Johann Gottfried Schadow in marble and replaced in 1857 with a bronze cast by August Ki. It stands today on the Zietenplatz on the corner Wilhelmstrae and Mohrenstrae Berlin next to the monument of Leopold I, the Old Dessauer. A similar one stands at Rupppin See. Frederick William II established the first memorial in Berlin in 1794.

From 1936 to 1945, Gottingen had the Zieten barracks and the Zieten Terrace Pietrowice German Peterwitz in the rural community of Gubczyce German Leobschutz in Silesia was called Zietenbusch from 1936 to 1945.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans%20Joachim%20von%20Zieten
"SMS Zieten was the first torpedo armed aviso built for the Imperial German Navy Kaiserliche Marine . She was built in Britain in 18751876, and was the last major warship built for Germany by a foreign shipyard. Ordered as a testbed for the new Whitehead torpedo, Zieten was armed with a pair of 38 cm 15 in torpedo tubes, and was capable of a top speed of 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph , making her the fastest ship in the German fleet at the time. Zieten was the first torpedo armed vessel in a series of avisos that ultimately developed into the first light cruisers. In addition to her impact in German warship design, Zieten also influenced numerous other navies, who built dozens of similar avisos and torpedo vessels of their own. Zieten served for the first two decades of her career with the torpedo boat flotilla. In 18781880, she was captained by Alfred von Tirpitz, the future architect of the High Seas Fleet. In 1882, she cruised the Mediterranean Sea with several other German warships, and was present during the British bombardment of Alexandria, where she protected German interests. Zieten was used as a fishery protection ship from 1899 until 1914, when the outbreak of World War I necessitated her mobilization as a coastal patrol ship. She served in this capacity for the duration of the war, and was stricken from the naval register in December 1919. The ship was finally sold for scrapping in August 1921, after forty five years of service. In 1869, the Prussian Navy sent then Korvettenkapitan Alexander von Monts to Austria to examine the new Whitehead torpedoes then being developed there. Albrecht von Stosch, the commander in chief of the new Imperial German Navy, approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for the German fleet, and placed Monts in charge of the program in 1873. That year, Stosch's naval construction program called for a tender for the new torpedo boats. The tender was ordered from the British firm the Thames Iron Works, and named Zieten. She was to be the last major warship purchased by the German navy from a foreign shipyard. In addition to the planned role as a tender for torpedo boats, she was also intended to serve as a test platform for the new self propelled torpedo. Up to the mid 1870s, the German navy had only experimented with a handful of torpedo ships, all of which were equipped with the old spar torpedo. The ship's design provided the basis for both later German avisosthe Blitz classand all subsequent light cruisers, but also to numerous foreign designs, such as several classes of French, Italian, and Austrian avisos and torpedo craft. Zieten was 69.5 meters 228 ft long at the waterline and 79.4 m 260 ft long overall. She had a beam of 8.56 m 28.1 ft and a draft of 3.8 m 12 ft forward. She displaced 1,001 metric tons 985 long tons 1,103 short tons as designed and up to 1,170 t 1,150 long tons 1,290 short tons at full combat load. The hull was constructed with transverse iron frames and contained eight watertight compartments. Initially, Zieten had only a small bridge forward, but in 1899, a new superstructure was built it included a conning tower with a compass platform. A chart house was also added forward of the funnel. Zieten was a good sea boat with a gentle motion, but she was very crank. She was very maneuverable, but she handled poorly in a head sea. In bad weather, she took on considerable amounts of water and was very dangerous. The ship had a crew of 6 officers and 88 enlisted men, though later in her career the figure rose to 7 and 99, respectively. During her career as a fishery protection ship, it rose further, to 7 officers and 104 sailors. Zieten carried a number of smaller boats one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and one dinghy. Later in her career, the picket boat was removed and two barges were added. The ships propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 cylinder double expansion engines manufactured by John Penn and Sons. The engines drove two 3 bladed propellers that were 3.05 m 10.0 ft wide in diameter. Steam was provided by six coal fired cylindrical boilers, also manufactured by John Penn and Sons, which were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The boilers were replaced with new models in 1891 during a refit at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel. As built, Zieten was fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of 355 square meters 3,820 sq ft to supplement her steam engines, but this was later reduced to only an auxiliary gaff sail. The engines were rated at 2,000 metric horsepower 2,000 ihp , but only managed to reach 1,807 metric horsepower 1,782 ihp at maximum power. With the new boilers, the engines reached 2,376 metric horsepower 2,343 ihp . Her top speed as designed was to have been 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph , but with her original boilers, she could make 15.9 knots 29.4 km h 18.3 mph at full power. This speed nevertheless made Zieten the fastest ship in the German fleet. With the new boilers, she could steam at up to 16.3 knots 30.2 km h 18.8 mph . Zieten could carry up to 130 t 130 long tons 140 short tons of coal, which allowed her to steam for 1,770 nautical miles 3,280 km 2,040 mi at a cruising speed of 9 knots 17 km h 10 mph . During the refit, she also had one electricity generator, with an output of 10 kilowatts 13 hp at 67 volts, installed. Zieten's primary armament consisted of a pair of 38 centimeter 15 in torpedo tubes. Both were submerged in the hull, one in the bow and one in the stern. They were supplied with a total of ten Whitehead torpedoes. These powerful weapons, coupled with the ship's high speed and maneuverability, made her a formidable vessel for the period. In 1878, the forward torpedo tube was relocated to a swivel launched mounted on the deck, and two 12 cm 4.7 in guns were installed. She was also equipped with six machine guns. Later in her career, the torpedo tubes were removed, due to their obsolescence, and she was rearmed with six 5 cm 1.97 in SK L 40 guns, though two were later removed. The guns were supplied with a total of 864 rounds of ammunition, and could engage targets out to 6,200 m 20,300 ft . She was also equipped to lay naval mines, and she could carry 49 of them. Zieten was built by the Thames Iron Works in London. She was laid down in 1875 and was launched on 9 March 1876. She was completed on 15 July 1876, and commissioned into the German fleet on 1 August. She was thereafter used in experiments with early torpedoes and as a tender for torpedo boats. In 1876, Otto von Diederichs served aboard the ship as her executive officer in her first crew. In August, the ship conducted sea trials in the North Sea, before arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 11 August for fitting out work. Diederichs supervised the installation of the ship's torpedo tubes, along with the magazine for storing the torpedoes. The work lasted until September, which prevented Zieten from participating in the annual AugustSeptember fleet exercises. As a result, she was placed in reserve on 17 September for the winter. In March 1877, Diederichs returned to the ship and prepared her for service in the training season that year. The ship was ready for active duty by 11 June, and thereafter conducted further sea trials and torpedo training. After Zieten entered service in June 1877, Diederichs was replaced by Alfred von Tirpitz, who took over torpedo testing while he was assigned to the Torpedo School at Kiel. Diederichs meanwhile readied the old gunboat Scorpion as a tender for Zieten. On 18 September, Zieten and Scorpion participated in the first major test of the new Whitehead torpedoes in the German navy. During the exercises, Zieten scored three hits on a stationary target, which was deemed a great success. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Zieten was placed in reserve on 2 October for the winter. The analysis of the testing showed that the bow mounted torpedo tube was not satisfactory, and so Diederichs was tasked with redesigning her armament in January 1878. Diederichs moved the bow tube to a swivel mount on her deck, and added two 12 cm guns to improve her defense against small warships. The refit work was completed by 16 April 1878, permitting Tirpitz to take command of the ship on 6 May. He served as the ship's commander until August 1880. Tirpitz, as the commander of Germany's torpedo boat flotilla, staunchly advocated the development of torpedo craft rather than a fleet of battleships. In July 1880, during maneuvers with the fleet, Zieten torpedoed and sank the old paddle steamer Barbarossa. In 1882, Zieten joined a cruising squadron that consisted of the corvettes Gneisenau and Nymphe, the steamer Loreley, and a gunboat, for operations in the Mediterranean Sea. The ships were present during the British bombardment of Alexandria in August 1882 they sent men ashore to protect the German embassy, along with a German run hospital. In July, Zieten joined a squadron of ships to take the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II for a tour of Baltic ports, which included a visit to Tsar Alexander III of Russia. The ship was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the Reserve Squadron in the North Sea in 1898, along with the coastal defense ships Beowulf and Frithjof. Starting in 1899, Zieten was used intermittently as a fishery protection ship. In September 1902, Zieten participated in the final exercises during the annual fleet maneuvers. Her career as a fishery protection ship lasted until 1914, when she was mobilized at the outbreak of World War I in August. She was used as a coast guard ship for the duration of the conflict. After Germany's defeat, Zieten was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919. The ship was sold on 18 August 1921 for 655,000 marks and broken up in Wilhelmshaven.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20Zieten
"Nicholas Theodore Nemeth born July 27, 1980 is an American professional wrestler and stand up comedian. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Dolph Ziggler. After a prolific career in amateur wrestling, where he established several school records for Kent State University, Nemeth signed a development contract with WWE in 2004 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling OVW , where he wrestled under his real name. He was promoted to WWE's Raw brand shortly afterwards in 2005, playing the caddy sidekick to Kerwin White. He was sent back to OVW shortly afterwards, being given the name Nicky and joining the cheerleading themed Spirit Squad, who debuted on Raw in January 2006 and won the World Tag Team Championship once before returning to OVW that November. In September 2007, Nemeth was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling FCW , where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, with Brad Allen and later Gavin Spears.

He feuded with Paul Burchill and challenged unsuccessfully for the OVW Television Championship, losing a championship match against then champion Ken Doane on August 12, 2005. Nemeth was called up to the Raw roster shortly afterwards, making his television debut on the September 19, 2005, episode of Sunday Night Heat. He was made the enforcer and sidekick for Chavo Guerrero, Jr., who was using a golfer in ring persona and going by the ring name of Kerwin White . As such, Nemeth became White's caddy. His wrestling debut came on an episode of Sunday Night Heat, teaming up with White in a tag team match against Shelton Benjamin and Matt Striker. After the death of Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero dropped the Kerwin White character, and Nemeth no longer played the role of his caddy and tag partner. After a few months of wrestling in dark matches and at house shows, he was sent back to OVW. Nemeth became a part of The Spirit Squad faction, a group of five wrestlers who used the in ring personas of male cheerleaders, and adopted the name Nicky in OVW during late 2005. The Spirit Squad members trained with real cheerleaders and gymnasts to ensure their characters were believable. On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry The King Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler.

In May, McMahon signed another Handicap match, with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however instead the Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, and, as part of the storyline, shattered his knee with a steel chair. McMahon brought Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer however, after Triple H felt that the Squad had disrespected him, he attacked the group. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D Generation X DX and they began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on the Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII. At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the Squad also wrestled other teams in Raw's tag division over their World Tag Team Championship, successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay per view in September. The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw, until Kenny managed to defeat him on the October 23 episode. It was then announced that Flair and a WWE legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay per view in early November. The fans chose Roddy Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship. The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of Raw, when they were defeated in a five on three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped OVW, Louisville, Kentucky , a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come. Nemeth returned to OVW on January 17, 2007, at the television tapings, again using his Nick Nemeth ring name, along with Mike Mondo, formerly Mikey in the Spirit Squad, as the Frat Pack . The pair teamed with Mike Kruel in a match against Seth Skyfire, Shawn Spears, and Cody Runnels. unreliable source The team disbanded in the early parts of 2007.

At the end of August, Nemeth and Mike Mondo were moved to the Florida Championship Wrestling FCW developmental territory and in his debut there, Nemeth gained the nickname The Natural and defeated Hade Vansen. In November 2007, Nemeth gained Big Rob as his manager, but their alliance was short lived. At the start of 2008, he tweaked his name to Nic Nemeth and began teaming with Brad Allen, with the pair gaining Taryn Terrell as their valet. Nemeth and Allen started a frat boy type ring character with Terrell as a sorority girl. On March 22, Nemeth and Allen won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship by defeating defending champions Eddie Colon and Eric Perez, but lost the championship to Colon and Perez on April 15. Throughout April and May 2008, Nemeth wrestled in several dark matches prior to Raw, losing to Kofi Kingston and Ron Killings on several occasions. Soon after, he returned to the name Nic Nemeth , and began teaming with Gavin Spears.

He made his debut on the April 17 episode of SmackDown, defeating the United States Champion, Montel Vontavious Porter MVP in a non title match, and, as a result, the following week he demanded a match for the championship. On the May 1 episode of SmackDown, however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel chair. As a result, Khali began coming out to the ring during and after Ziggler's matches, in attempt to gain revenge and to stop Ziggler from cheating. Over the next few weeks, Ziggler would defeat Khali by countout and disqualification after making it look like Khali had struck him with a steel chair. At The Bash pay per view, Ziggler defeated Khali in a No Disqualification match by pinfall, after Kane interfered and attacked Khali.

On February 4, Ziggler's storyline girlfriend Vickie Guerrero, who was the acting General Manager of SmackDown, banned the spear Edge's finishing move and decided that if Edge used it, Ziggler would be awarded the championship. Ziggler was again defeated by Edge in a rematch on the February 11 episode of SmackDown, but because Edge used the spear, Guerrero declared Ziggler the new champion on the February 14 episode of Raw. Prior to Ziggler's official coronation ceremony on SmackDown on February 18, Guerrero also fired Edge, claiming that he had attacked SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long several weeks prior. However, Long interrupted Ziggler's ceremony and accused Guerrero of orchestrating the attack, prompting Guerrero to reveal Ziggler as the attacker and Long to rehire Edge.

This, coupled with Ziggler's concurrent feud with Alex Riley, led Ziggler to defend and retain his United States Championship in a fatal four way match against Swagger, Riley, and John Morrison at Night of Champions. On the September 19 episode of Raw, Ziggler lost a non title match to Zack Ryder when guest star Hugh Jackman helped Ryder by punching Ziggler in the face. Although Ziggler later claimed to have a broken jaw due to Jackman's punch, it was reported that the supposed injury was fake. Later that night, Guerrero officially began managing Swagger, and Swagger began interfering in Ziggler's matches to help him win.

"Ziggurat, stylized as ZiGGURAT, is a retro style arcade shooter video game developed by Action Button Entertainment for iOS platforms. As the world's last human fighting off incoming alien freaks from atop a ziggurat, the player uses touch controls to charge and shoot the enemies away, and dies if hit by an enemy. The game has 16 bit graphics style and an 8 bit chiptune soundtrack. Action Button designer Tim Rogers developed the game idea based on his experience with Angry Birds, which later led to his forming Action Button as a company with Ziggurat as its first release on February 17, 2012. The game received generally favorable reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised Ziggurat's nuanced controls and minimalism. Time magazine picked the game as one of the best for the then new high resolution third generation iPad. As the Last Human on Earth , the player fights off approaching enemies with their laser rifle. The player character, stationary atop a mountain peak ziggurat at the top of the world and end of time, attacks incoming mono eyed alien freaks and dies upon the first hit from any enemy. The player earns a score based on their number of aliens killed before succumbing. The aliens vary in size and shape, from blue freaks who pogo like the Tektites from Zelda, to stealth yellow freaks, to shielded, aggressive red freaks, to bullet sponge giant freaks. There are two shooting modes Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players control the shot by sliding their fingers along the bottom of the screen, which calculates the arc and direction of the shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power if held too long. There are no power ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to see the end of the universe. It also integrates pro social features like GameCenter and Twitter. Ziggurat uses retro style 16 bit graphics and an 8 bit chiptune soundtrack. The player character is blonde and dressed in a red jumpsuit, and clouds pass by in parallax motion in the background. The sun's position in the distance appears as a function of game's duration. The chiptune soundtrack includes wailing solos, and its pitch appears to intensify with the game's difficulty. The player's death is accompanied by a wince inducing digital screech or siren and a blood red screen . Action Button Entertainment was founded by Tim Rogers. The studio consists of Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski, who have built all of the studio's four games from Ziggurat through Videoball. Their games are consistently simple in their aesthetics and controls. Rogers cited Angry Birds as the inspiration for Ziggurat. He found the former an incredible collision of game design concepts that worked, though he wanted the game to be more of a driving range where he could throw birds at falling stuff, an idea which he refined into a Raiders of the Lost Ark themed game of slowly hurling projectiles that push back bats in a corridor with no limit of projectiles. When riding the Bay Area Rapid Transit from Oakland to San Francisco a year later, Rogers watched a man play Angry Birds as he perfected a level, whereupon Rogers decided to make his game idea. He asked his friend and indie developer Adam Saltsman for advice, who confirmed and encouraged Rogers's interest in trying Flixel, the Adobe Flash tools used to make Saltsman's Canabalt. Upon deciding that he lacked the expertise, he tweeted to recruit others on the project and received some responses that later fell through. Rogers continued to work as a video game design consultant and met Bob Pelloni of Bob's Game at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. The two worked on games including Ziggurat together. Rogers put out a call for artists on Twitter with a submissions request of fan art of the Japanese box art of Phantasy Star II , and Action Button artist Brent Porter replied in under an hour with an entry Rogers called incredible . In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. While Pelloni was against the buttonless iPhone as a platform, Rogers said the team was convinced by his design document. He contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through in a week with a version without graphics or sound, which was later added. Rogers recorded some insane and rough music with his band, Large Prime Numbers, that Andrew Toups converted into an 8 bit soundtrack in the original Nintendo sound format that Rogers found breathtaking . His friend, QWOP creator Bennett Foddy, deemed the game sort of interesting . Six months passed as Rogers worked on a social game before he chose to make a few more changes more enemy types and progression, graphics in the background, and so emailed people to continue development. Rogers described his own critical list of video games as having minimalist aesthetics with no overt story to tell other than through its game mechanics, and wanted the game to live up to those expectations. He fine tuned the game with gut driven decisions. For example, he applied a concept he called sticky friction from Super Mario Bros. 3 to the game's controls. One of the final features was the scream sound effect Rogers made with his guitar and crushed for a distorted and quasi digital sound that he compared to those made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned. Rogers explained that they did not add a pause option because he did not want non game icons in the screen and because like in Contra players would die too soon after resuming. He saw the game as simultaneously a snow globe of an electric toy and a gosh darn airtight hardcore video game homage to the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and called Ziggurat a descendant of his hobbies Ibara Black Label and the Rubik's Cube. Rogers added that the game contained nine hours of scripted events and that the Archenemy alien is only the beginning . Rogers produced a trailer for the game. It was released for iOS platforms on February 17, 2012. Two months later, Freshuu, then the game's publisher, signed Ziggurat as the first client for Gimme, an in game achievement to real life rewards incentive program. The game received two spikes in sales following positive reviews from journalists, and from a mock infomercial's release on YouTube, all postrelease and not at the time of launch. Brandon Sheffield, writing for Game Developer, thought that Rogers handled the postrelease well since leaking details to the press before the game was available may have impacted sales. Action Button later became the game's publisher. The game received generally favorable reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It won a Destructoid Editors' Choice Award, and Time magazine picked the game as one of the best for the then new high resolution third generation iPad. Edge compared the game to a more pleasurable version of Halo Reach's final scene. The magazine also compared the feeling of prioritization as a swarm of enemies appear to the feeling of clutter when stacking Tetris blocks haphazardly. Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death brash and lo fi and unexpectedly poignant , for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as a beguiling personal signature . Alternatively, Paste's Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not accomplish what it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade noticed how the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more of a basketball or golf like sport skill than a 2D Halo . Edge awarded the game a 9 of 10, adding that it prized immediacy in a manner that matched the iOS platform. Eurogamer's Martin Robinson said the game made him nostalgic for a score attack game from the early 90s that does not exist, and as such called Ziggurat one of the finer simple score attack shooters ... on the App Store and an expression of the golden age of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. He called the game's mechanics fine tuned and the gun's abilities collated from the best elements of other video games. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com likewise found the controls very well suited for touchscreens. He also praised the chained explosions and shot charging as satisfying , and compared the game to Missile Command in its allure. Robinson of Eurogamer said the game's deserving peers were Geometry Wars and Robotron for their refined play styles that make players predict what enemies are about to act. TouchArcade's Leray praised the game design and never reached a place where his skills plateaued. He advised against using the Slingshot mode controls. Joe Bernardi of Paste put Ziggurat in a lineage of iOS games where the player tries to do a fun thing as much as possible before dying, including Canabalt, Bit Pilot, and Super Crate Box. He connected Ziggurat's mechanics to Rogers's longstanding interest in infinite mode without external rewards, and praised the charge time mechanics as excellent and the perfect awkward length to confuse muscle memory. Leray of TouchArcade praised its attention to detail, especially in the character sprites. Paste's Bernardi called Action Button's design restraint admirable and lauded the game's balance. He noted its extremely focused shallowness as defining, like a Dorito, and called it one of the best iOS games ever played . Reviewing for ActionButton.net, indie developer Adam Saltsman called Ziggurat French New Wave action videogame fan art .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat%20%28video%20game%29
"Nikola Zigic Serbian Cyrillic , IPA born 25 September 1980 is a former Serbian international footballer who played as a centre forward. Zigic was born in Backa Topola, in what was then SFR Yugoslavia. He began playing football as a youngster with AIK Backa Topola, and scored 68 goals from 76 first team matches over a three year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football. Military service took him to Bar in 2001, where he was able to continue his goalscoring career with the local second level club Mornar. A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side Red Star Belgrade in January 2003. He spent time on loan at third tier Spartak Subotica before making his Red Star debut later that year. Despite suggestions that his height, of 2.02 m 6 ft 7 12 in , made him better suited to sports other than football, Zigic ended the season as First League top scorer, domestic player of the year, league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final. He won a second leaguecup double in 200506, a second player of the year award, and finished his three year Red Star career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions. In August 2006, Zigic signed for Spanish club Racing Santander his goals and his partnership with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid table finish in La Liga. He then moved to Valencia, but was unable to establish himself as a regular in the starting eleven. He spent the second half of the 200809 La Liga season back with Racing on loan, for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches. Zigic joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010, and in his first season, he scored in their League Cup win. Even after relegation to the Championship, and despite increasing efforts to remove his large salary from the financially struggling club's wage bill, he remained with Birmingham for the full four years of his contract. Having been without a club for a few months, he rejoined Birmingham for the second half of the 201415 season. Zigic made his senior international debut for Serbia and Montenegro in March 2004, and following the breakup of Serbia and Montenegro in 2006, he played internationally for Serbia until 2011. He won 57 caps for his country and scored 20 goals. He was a member of the 2006 and 2010 World Cup squads, and briefly captained his country in 2011. Zigic was born in Backa Topola, in what was then SFR Yugoslavia, the son of Jovan, a former footballer, and his wife Milica, who had been a basketball player. He completed his secondary education at the mechanical engineering school in Backa Topola. His brother Branko, 15 months his junior, also became a footballer, as a central defender with clubs including Cement Beocin and Serbian First League club Proleter Novi Sad. During the Yugoslav Wars in 1999, Zigic's hometown was beneath the flight path of NATO bombers heading for Belgrade for much of that part of the conflict, the family home was without electricity or running water. Zigic is married to Sanja the couple have two daughters and a son. As of 2018 , they were living near Valencia, Spain, and Zigic was assisting in his agent's business. He joined his hometown football club, AIK Backa Topola, as a youngster, and graduated to the senior side in 199899. He began as a centre back, but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending. Zigic's parents did not want him to take football seriously until he completed his education, and he remained with AIK Backa Topola until 2001, scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League Vojvodina, the third level of Yugoslav football. When military service took him to Bar, he was able to play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 200102 Second League of FR Yugoslavia. After trials in France with Saint Etienne and Creteil came to nothing, Zigic returned home where he played 8 matches for third tier club Kolubara, scoring 3 goals. Zigic signed his first professional contract in January 2003, with Red Star Belgrade, one of the biggest clubs in the country. Because he was not considered ready for first team football at that level, he spent the latter part of the 200203 season on loan at Spartak Subotica, another third tier side, for whom his goalscoring rate was even higher 14 goals from just 11 league games. Returning head coach Slavoljub Muslin brought Zigic into Red Star's senior squad for the 200304 First League season, and gave him his debut in the starting eleven on the opening day. That first game ended in defeat, and Zigic's physical appearance a growth spurt from the age of 16 had brought his height to 2.02 m 6 ft 7 12 in provoked suggestions that he might be better suited to basketball. He opened the scoring as they beat Hajduk Kula 20 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat trick against Nistru in the 200304 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 65 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 30 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Vecernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final. Resuming the partnership with Marko Pantelic begun in the second half of 200304, Zigic continued to score freely in the new season. With Red Star two goals and a man down in the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys, he netted twice in the last 12 minutes to give his team an away draw. Domestically, Pantelic top scored with 21 league goals and Zigic contributed 15 as Red Star finished in second place, behind Partizan. Zigic scored against Partizan to help Red Star reach the cup final, but was one of five regular starters unavailable for that match through injury or suspension, and his team lost to a last minute goal to ten man Zeleznik. In September 2005, Zigic signed a one year extension to his contract, which had been due to expire at the end of the season. He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup, and according to Reuters' correspondent, capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals as well as providing the cross for Milan Purovic as Red Star beat Roma 31 in the third match of the group stage. His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexes, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from 25 m 27 yd with his weaker left foot. He said afterwards, I've never scored a goal like that in my entire career. I was going to pass the ball but there was no one ahead of me so I just decided to go for it and see what happens . The win left Red Star needing to win their last group match to stand a chance of qualifying for the knockout rounds, but they failed to do so. For the second time in three years, Zigic was chosen as domestic player of the year in the captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelic's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Zigic and Bosko Jankovic were joint top scorers with 12, and Purovic contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 20 down via Zigic's 67th minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purovic's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Zigic gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dusan Basta made the final score 42. After the match, Zigic refused to answer questions about his Red Star future. Zigic began the season with Red Star, but on 29 August 2006, he signed a four year contract with La Liga club Racing Santander. The fee, officially undisclosed, was variously reported at anything from 4.5M to 7M. Although better offers had been rejected, those offers had arrived at the wrong time the pressure on Red Star to win the domestic title meant they were unlikely to dispose of a major player in mid season. The player felt he was more likely to start matches with a club at Racing's level. Partnering the diminutive Pedro Munitis, he contributed 11 goals including a hat trick in a 54 win over Athletic Bilbao four assists and five penalties won in league competition over the season as Racing finished tenth. The efficacy of the pair earned them the nickname of Duo Sacapuntos the Two Point getters ahead of the coming season, new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral recalled how we all know how many points Racing picked up when Zigic and Munitis weren't there. Without them, Racing didn't add points . His performances earned him the captains' vote as best player based abroad for 2006, and contributed to his 2007 Football Association of Serbia Golden Ball award. Zigic signed for Valencia in August 2007. The fee was unconfirmed, but suggestions appeared in the media of 15M, 18M, and around 20M, a figure possibly including the player's wages over the five years of his contract. He had been linked with numerous other moves, and Fenerbahce made an offer that was better financially for both Racing and the player, but Zigic preferred to stay in the best league in Europe in a country where he was accustomed to the language and culture. He was suffering from an ankle injury when he arrived which delayed his integration into the first team group and, according to Mundo Deportivo, undermined the coaching staff's confidence in him then aggravated the injury by playing in a Euro 2008 qualifier in September, and did not appear for Valencia until October. He made his debut as a second half substitute in Valencia's Champions League group stage defeat at home to Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Zigic two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 10 down to third tier opponents Real Union. Zigic came on and scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 22 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman changed his mind about the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances two starts in what remained of the season, and was sent off in the first of those. Speculation regarding moves to the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Zigic had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernandez on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus freeing up a space in the first team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career ending, so any agreement with Zigic had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign. The loan agreement was duly revived, and Zigic returned to the club and the city that feel like home . Racing were to pay his wages and write off the debt outstanding from the sale of Mario Regueiro, and there was no option to purchase. Resuming his partnership with Munitis in the first game of his second spell, Zigic scored the only goal of the visit to Real Valladolid, repeated the feat at Getafe two weeks later, and scored again in the next match, a 20 win away at Sevilla. He finished the season as Racing's top scorer, with 13 goals from only 19 games. In the 2009 close season, there were rumours linking Zigic with moves to clubs including Sunderland, Monaco, and Bordeaux, but the player insisted his intention was and always had been to be successful with Valencia. He made 26 appearances for the club in 200910 in all competitions, more than in the previous two seasons combined, but only 5 were league starts. Within four minutes of replacing the injured David Villa in the league match against Racing in October, he took advantage of a defensive error to score the only goal of the game out of respect for his former club, he did not celebrate. On 2 January 2010, his 93rd minute header against Espanyol took Valencia third in the table, and his double against Deportivo La Coruna in the 200910 Copa del Rey put Valencia 20 up at half time the game finished 22 and Valencia lost 43 on aggregate. With four minutes left of the Europa League quarter final second leg, Valencia were denied a penalty when an Atletico Madrid defender pulled Zigic to the ground so forcefully that a large hole was torn in the front of his shirt, apparently unnoticed by referee or goalline official the tie ended goalless, so Atletico progressed on away goals from the first leg and went on to win the competition. Away to Espanyol on 1 May, again as a substitute for Villa, he scored both goals in a 20 win that secured Valencia a place in the next season's Champions League. On 25 May 2010, Zigic signed a four year contract with Premier League club Birmingham City for an undisclosed fee, which media speculation suggested to be in the region of 6 million. He made his debut on the opening day of the season away at Sunderland replacing Garry O'Connor in the 58th minute, he came close to scoring from outside the penalty area and injected a note of panic hitherto undetected in the home team's defence as Birmingham came back from 20 down to secure a draw. Zigic's first goal for the club came as Birmingham beat Milton Keynes Dons 31 in the League Cup on 21 September. He scored his first Premier League goal on 16 October, opening the scoring at Arsenal with a header from Keith Fahey's cross, but Birmingham lost the game 21. In a hostile League Cup quarter final against local rivals Aston Villa, Zigic had an apparently valid goal disallowed for offside against another player, and with the scores level after 86 minutes, was about to be substituted when he produced a mis hit, deflected, scruffy late goal that secured the win. He opened the scoring against favourites Arsenal in the final with a short range header, and with one minute of normal time remaining, he flicked on a long clearance, Arsenal's goalkeeper and central defender got in each other's way, and the ball fell to Obafemi Martins to tap in the winning goal. Football manager turned commentator David Pleat wrote that Birmingham earned their victory through terrific teamwork and astute deployment of Zigic's strengths. Because of niggling hip and groin injuries, he made only two more substitute appearances. His absence deprived the team of what the Birmingham Mail's reporter called their most effective style getting the ball forward early, pressing up the pitch and playing off him , as they were relegated to the Championship. Despite his agent Milan Calasan's insistence that his client would not be playing in the lower divisions, Zigic underwent groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail that he would be happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 10 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty taker Marlon King, Zigic took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 10, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Zigic scored all four in a 41 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play off semi final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool. Ahead of the 201213 season, Zigic was close to a return to Spain with Real Mallorca. Birmingham were prepared to give him a free transfer to reduce the wage bill by his reported 50,000 a week, but the deal fell through when board and agent could not agree a payoff for the player, who earlier in the summer had expressed his intention to see out the two years left on his contract. He began the playing season on the bench, coming off it after 85 minutes to produce a 94th minute equaliser at home to Charlton Athletic on the opening day, and was used more as substitute than starter by new manager Lee Clark, who preferred Peter Lvenkrands or Leroy Lita. On the eve of the January transfer window, chief executive Peter Pannu confirmed that player sales were necessary to stave off the risk of administration. Even if the club could raise as much as 6M from the sale of England goalkeeper Jack Butland, Zigic's wages were more than the club could afford, and the player needed to go out and showcase himself. The club had failed to include a clause in his contract to reduce his wages in the event of relegation, and it emerged later that they had agreed to substantial annual increments. He did not leave, and in February, Clark publicly criticised him for producing possibly the worst training session in terms of a professional footballer I have ever come across , despite knowing he was due to start the upcoming game against Watford. Up until this incident, he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes, and been sent off twice. Clark said that Zigic would not be involved against Watford, but that it was in his hands as to whether he would prepare properly for the Sheffield Wednesday fixture three days later. His response must have been acceptable, because he played the whole of the goalless draw against Wednesday, started all the remaining matches the longest run of starts of his Birmingham career and ended the season with nine league goals, second only to King. Zigic missed the first few weeks of the 201314 season with a back problem, and once fit, played regularly throughout the season, as one of a small number of senior players in an inexperienced and youthful team with numerous short term loanees. The team struggled, and reached the last day of the season needing at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Zigic scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close range header was cleared off the line to Paul Caddis, who headed home to preserve Birmingham's second tier status. Birmingham were reported to be quietly confident of retaining his services for another season, at a much reduced salary, especially as he was believed to be keen on applying for British citizenship, which required five years' residence, but he left at the end of his contract. He was the last remaining member of the League Cup winning team. Having been without a club since his departure, Zigic began training with Birmingham again in November 2014. After a successful appeal to be granted a work permit, for which he did not qualify automatically, he signed a contract on 4 December to expire at the end of the season. He made his second debut as a late substitute in the Championship match at home to Reading on 13 December, with Birmingham already 61 ahead. He played only infrequently nine substitute appearances in the league and two FA Cup matches and the club confirmed he would be released when his contract expired. Coach Ilija Petkovic gave Zigic his international debut for Serbia and Montenegro on 31 March 2004, as an 84th minute substitute in a 10 friendly defeat against Norway in Belgrade. His next appearance and first start came some 14 months later in a friendly against Italy in Canada, he ran onto a through ball and went round the goalkeeper to open the scoring and also hit the post in a 11 draw. He also scored in his next match, against Poland in another friendly, and established himself as a regular selection, but it was his substitute appearance in a crucial World Cup qualifier against Spain in Madrid in September 2005 that brought him wider international recognition. After a poor first half Petkovic said they were lucky to be only a goal down at half time Zigic was introduced, and the tactic of putting him in the centre of the opposition defence and playing long high balls to him ... was remarkably successful . He pressured the goalkeeper into missing a cross which dropped for Dejan Stankovic to set up Mateja Kezman's equaliser, and 12 minutes later, his pass left Kezman clear on goal but he mis hit what might have been a winning shot. The result left Serbia Montenegro top of the group, and they confirmed their qualification at home to Bosnia and Herzegovina when Zigic's assist gave Kezman a tap in for the only goal of the game. Zigic's only start at the 2006 World Cup came in the last fixture, when his team had already been eliminated after losing the first two group matches. He scored early in the first half off a long ball from Stankovic against Ivory Coast the goal was Serbia Montenegro's first of the tournament but the match ended in a 32 defeat. Still an automatic choice under new national manager Javier Clemente, Zigic scored the only goal in Serbia's first competitive match as a separate country, a Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Azerbaijan in September 2006. He scored once, missed two more good chances and was then sent off for elbowing an opponent in stoppage time of the March 2007 qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan, so missed the next, a home draw with Portugal, and also missed the Finland fixture in June after surgery on a facial injury. He still scored seven goals as Serbia failed to qualify. Zigic played regularly through the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under the management of Radomir Antic, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelic as Serbia qualified for a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006 I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that can do it in big games. After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first half dismissal, Zigic headed a cross down to Milan Jovanovic who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game Lukas Podolski's second half penalty was saved, and Antic dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 21 and finished bottom of the group. Goals in four of Serbia's five internationals in the latter part of 2010 brought his total to 20. He was not selected to start the other match, a Euro 2012 qualifier in Italy that was abandoned after six minutes because of crowd trouble UEFA awarded the match to the hosts as a 30 win. After Serbia failed to qualify for the tournament, both Stankovic and Nemanja Vidic retired from international football, and Zigic was appointed captain of the national team. He captained the team in friendly defeats to Mexico and Honduras in 2011, his 56th and 57th appearances for his country, which proved to be his last. Zigic's extreme height predisposes him to an aerial game. He is dangerous from set pieces, scoring many headed goals and knocking the ball down for others when he joined Red Star, the coach set out the team in a 433 formation, with Zigic at centre forward and two wingers to feed those strengths. He tried to use his physical presence to disrupt opposing defences, both for his own benefit and to draw their attentions away from others. Pep Guardiola said in 2009 that Zigic was not easy to defend against, almost unstoppable in the air, but the best way would be to keep him as far as possible away from the penalty area. Speaking in 2010, Radovan Curcic, then assistant manager of the Serbia national team, described him as the king of air play, he is the finest there is in Europe. He possesses the sense of space and movement without the ball and can assist his teammates with headers and set up goal scoring opportunities. As exemplified on his debut for Racing, a performance in which he demonstrated his aerial power, he is capable of playing with his back to goal, and his height was not incompatible with agility. He prefers to play not as a lone striker but in partnership with a shorter, speedier, teammate. Racing's fitness coach, Javier Minano, was surprised that Zigic was well coordinated, to the extent that he doesn't seem so tall when I see him in training. He prefers to receive the ball in the air, because he can always beat smaller players in the air but they can take advantage of better acceleration and quicker reactions on the ground. According to David Pleat, a major factor in Birmingham's 2011 League Cup win was telling him to do what he does best and flick the ball on with his head from direct diagonal balls played from both wings . Nevertheless, he is technically competent, scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others. A 2009 feature in Mundo Deportivo assessed Zigic as one of those few tall players with a good touch on the ball, and in 2010, German international defender Per Mertesacker described him as technically a good player and very smart tactically .

"Zigrasimecia is an extinct genus of ants which existed in the Cretaceous period approximately 98 million years ago. The first specimens were collected from Burmese amber in Kachin State, 100 kilometres 62 mi west of Myitkyina town in Myanmar. In 2013, palaeoentomologists Phillip Barden and David Grimaldi published a paper describing and naming Zigrasimecia tonsora. They described a dealate female with unusual features, notably the highly specialized mandibles. Other features include large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres, small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg like denticles. The genus Zigrasimecia was originally incertae sedis uncertain placement within Formicidae until a second species, Zigrasimecia ferox, was described in 2014, confirming its placement in the subfamily Sphecomyrminae. Due to the highly specialized mandibles, scientists believe that the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them probably for feeding behavior , and the rugose projections may have played a major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator. Zigrasimecia tonsora is only known from a single specimen, the holotype, specimen number JZC Bu 159. At the time of description, the specimen was residing in the private collection of James Zigras and only available for study through the American Museum of Natural History. The solitary adult fossil is composed of a mostly complete dealate adult female which has been preserved as an inclusion in transparent chunks of deep yellow and relatively clear Burmese amber. The amber specimen was recovered from deposits in Kachin State, 100 kilometres 62 mi west of Myitkyina town in Myanmar. Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 99 million years old, close to the Aptian Cenomanian boundary. The fossil was first studied by palaeoentomologists Phillip Barden and David Grimaldi, both of the AMNH. Barden and Grimaldi's 2013 type description of the new genus and species was published in the online journal Zootaxa. The genus name Zigrasimecia is a patronym which was coined as a combination of James Zigras' last name and mecia which is a commonly used suffix in ant generic names. The specific epithet tonsora was derived from a combination of the Latin words tonsor meaning barber or hairdresser and oris meaning mouth , in reference to the ants' mouthparts bearing combs and brushes. Zigrasimecia is one of seven ant species described from Burmese amber and one of the five Burmese amber species placed in Sphecomyrminae or incertae sedis. The other sphecomyrmin species are Haidomyrmex cerberus, Haidomyrmex scimitarus, Haidomyrmex zigrasi, and Gerontoformica orientalis. In Barden and Grimaldi's article, the authors could not sufficiently identify the ant with enough confidence to place it in a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful information on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies key diagnostic traits could have been used to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape the base segment of the antenna length petiole narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen and the metapleural gland secretory glands , as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies derived traits not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated perhaps once via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic. In 2014, palaeoentomologist Vincent Perrichot of the Universite de Rennes studied a number of specimens recovered in amber from the Late Cretaceous, dating back to 98 million years. The specimens were collected from Hukawng Valley in Kachin State. Upon examination, it was revealed that the specimens are distinct from Z. tonsora. As a result, Perrichot provided the first description of this ant in a 2014 article published by Myrmecological News. He named it Z. ferox its specific epithet means fierce in Latin, referencing the appearance of the head. Z. ferox is known from a holotype specimen, numbered JWJ Bu18a, and many paratypes. Three of these paratypes are completely preserved workers, and two partial workers are missing their legs and gastral apices, while one worker is missing its mesosoma the middle part of an insects body . In the same article, Perrichot moved Zigrasimecia to Sphecomyrminae, stating that there is little doubt that the species are members of Sphecomyrminae. He notes that the workers of Z. ferox possess most synapomorphies provided by Bolton. For example, the antennae are geniculate and the scapes are rather short the funiculus segments between the antennal base and club is filiform there are no known propodeal lobes a carina that delimits the propodeal scrobe laterally two spurs are present on the mesotibia and metatibia the middle and hind part of the tibia and a preapical tooth is found on the claws and a sting is present. Its placement within the tribe Sphecomyrmini is supported by the female mandibles bearing two teeth and the elongated third antennal segment. Based on the apomorphic characters, Zigrasimecia species may share a close relationship with other extinct ants such as Gerontoformica, particularly those that were in the former genus Sphecomyrmodes. The most prominent character is the peg like setae bristle like hairs found around the oral cavity the mouth . Certain species such as G. cretacica, G. orientalis and G. occidentalis possess one row of stout setae that can be found on the anterior portion of the clypeus one of the sclerites that make up the face of an arthropod or insect , while Z. tonsora shows two additional rows of these setae. However, such structures have not been identified in any other Cretaceous ant. The labral setae on G. cretacica and Z. tonsora are similar, although G. cretacia has teeth like setae, and Z. tonsora has tapered and hair like setae. The ocelli or simple eye because ocelli contain a single lens in G. orientalis and Z. tonsora are also similar in appearance G. cretacica does not possess ocelli, and it is not known whether G. orientalis possess them because the dorsal head region is obscured. Despite the similarities, it is unlikely that they are actually certain castes of the same species, especially because Z. tonsora is a dealated wingless female. The following cladogram of stem group ants in relation to wasps and crown group ants a group of living members that contain their descendants of the last common ancestor was produced by Barden and Grimaldi in 2016. Although Z. tonsora is not present in the cladogram, the placement of Z. ferox gives insight to the placement of the genus Chyphotes mellipes Chalybion californicum Heterogyna species Haidomyrmodes mammuthus Haidomyrmex scimitarus Haidoterminus cippus Sphecomyrma freyi Camelomecia janovitzi Myanmyrma gracilis Zigrasimecia ferox Gerontoformica spiralis Gerontoformica magnus Gerontoformica gracilis Gerontoformica pilosus Brownimecia clavata Based on Z. tonsora, queens are similar in appearance to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure these mandibles have two teeth, one of which is apical situated closer to the apex and the other is subapical below the apex tooth . Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres antenna segments , small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg like denticles small bumps on a tooth . Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule like setae. Furthermore, the vertex the upper surface of the head has a pair of oval shaped rugose wrinkled patches. Z. ferox is only known from small, wingless females. The head is similar to those of queens of Z. tonsora, but they can be separated by the lack of ocelli and rugose patches found on the vertex. Only a single row of denticles is present, and the vertexal margin seen posterodorsally is concave. The mesosoma is smooth and contains a single spine, fovea a pit or depression in a structure or carina a keel like elevation on the body wall of an insect . The posterior portion of the propodeal surface is concave it is high and strongly angled. All legs have flattened femurs the largest region of an insect's leg and tibiae, and the tibiae are carinated both anteriorly and posteriorly. The gaster the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma has five known segments. Like the queen, Z. ferox has a large, retractable stinger, in which the external part is enclosed by the gonostyli sting sheaths . The body length of Z. ferox varies from 2.0 to 2.8 millimetres 0.079 to 0.110 in . The head in Z. ferox is broad and crescent shaped when viewed dorsally. The frons upper part of the insect face is strongly convex, meaning it curves outwards and the vertexal margin concaves curves in it concaves either regularly or strongly. When viewing the full face, the clypeal margin the border of the clypeus is broad and concave. The sides are convex and small, yet protruding eyes are present. The posterior corners are round and the base of the ants' mandibles are concealed by the large expansion of the gena area below the compound eyes, the insect equivalent to human cheeks . The clypeus is shallow and transverse, and 48 denticles that decrease in length can be seen on the clypeal margin. The denticles are peg shaped with rounded apices. Dense spine like setae cover the labrum a flap like structure in front of the mouth these setae are organised into three rows. Each row, on average, contains around 20 setae which increase in length when they are ventral to the clypeus. The mandibles barely overlap medially, with a single large apical tooth and smaller subapical tooth present. The oral surface is covered in spicule like setae, in which the inner setae are four times longer than the outer setae. The palps are short and the maxillary palps sensory organs used for tasting and manipulating food have five segments. The labial palps counterparts of the maxillary palps used in sensory function for eating presumably have three segments. The frontal carinae a pair of cuticular ridges or flanges on the head are absent in Z. ferox. The antennae are well separated and contain 12 antennomeres, and the scalps are also short the toruli socket in which the antenna of an insect articulates is not significantly raised. The antennal scrobes grooves in the side of the head are shallow and project outwards from the antennal base and towards the ventral margin of the eyes. The mesosoma is half as broad than the head when viewed dorsally. The junction of the mesoscutellum middle part of the scutellum and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax is well developed and the mesopleuron the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax is separated from the rest of the mesosoma by distinct sulci deep grooves of the head . The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles external openings are slit like and located around the mid regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla the reservoirs is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus proximal end of the femur is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs the large spur calcar is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth. The gastral segments have small constrictions between the first and second segments. The stinger is long but largely internalized, and it is also stout and slightly upcurved apically. The external parts are enclosed by the gonostyli, and the sting bulb is large. The integument a protective outer layer is rugose throughout except on the legs and gaster. The dorsofrontal area of the head the back of an insect , and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and petiole are covered by erect hairs, and slightly longer hairs are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose bristles with longer decumbent hairs meaning that these hairs are lying down . The broad, flattened head of Z. tonsora is 0.66 millimetres 0.026 in in length and 0.76 millimetres 0.030 in wide excluding eyes . It is apparently prognathous it has a projecting lower jaw or chin , with the cervical connection found near the head. The occipital margin around the posterodorsal region is irregular in dorsal view and also emarginate. The postocciput posterior rim of the insect cranium is concave. The eyes are small but protrude from the head, and appear drop shaped when viewed laterally. The eyes are 0.21 millimetres 0.0083 in and 0.13 millimetres 0.0051 in wide and are found on the posterior half of the head. The ocelli are large, being 0.06 millimetres 0.0024 in in diameter. A pair of oval shaped, melanized patches of rugose cuticles are found on the vertex. The dorsofrontal side of the ants' head has fine, sparse setulae. A protruding gena can be seen, with a narrow but extended apex well past the clypeal denticles. The dorsoventral portion of the frons has shallow V shaped grooves that extend over the antennae bases. There is no evidence of any frontal carinae. The protruding toruli obscures the base of the antenna the antennal bases project underneath the toruli. Shallow antennal scrobes are seen and project outwards from the antennal bases and towards the ventral margin of the eyes. The antenna is 1.42 millimetres 0.056 in long, and has a total of 12 antennomeres, with the flagellum an antennal segment composed of ten flagellomeres. The scapes are short, measuring 0.22 millimetres 0.0087 in , and the pedicel the second segment of the antenna is 0.13 millimetres 0.0051 in The flagellomeres vary in length, ranging between 0.08 to 0.17 millimetres 0.0031 to 0.0067 in . The clypeus is shallow and measures 0.10 millimetres 0.0039 in when excluding the denticles . It is broad, and the distance between its lateral most denticles is 0.44 millimetres 0.017 in . It is also more concave shaped than it is straight. The oral margin of the clypeus is lined with a row of 30 denticles, which are peg shaped. They also have rounded apices. The row of clypeal margin denticles is composed of two short rows. Each row is composed of 15 denticles each. The mandibles are short and barely overlap medially. The mandibles measure 0.345 millimetres 0.0136 in . The dentition is simple, with a large apical tooth and subapical tooth present. The masticatory margin contains no teeth, and the outside areas of the mandibles are concave. The oral surface of the mandibles has dense brushes of stiff, sharp and spicule like setae. The labrum is covered in setae the setae found here are longer, yet more narrow than the setae found on the clypeus. The palps are short. The maxillary palps have five segments, which measure 0.23 millimetres 0.0091 in . The mesosoma is 0.55 millimetres 0.022 in wide and covered in erect setae on the dorsal surfaces . On the propodeum, the setae are slightly recurved. The neck is long and one quarter the length of the thorax when excluding the propodeum . V shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular shaped foveae that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C shaped grooves and foveae. The propodeum measures 0.55 millimetres 0.022 in long and sports a slit like spiracle which faces to the rear the posterior margin of the propodeum is shelf like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter leg part attached rigidly to the femur and femur on both the meso and metathoracic legs the middle and hindmost pair of legs . On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present. Zigrasimecia is known for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that suggests mobility was an important factor for them this is probably for feeding behavior . The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting. It is not known what the function of the oral setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator. It is evident that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia provides further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigrasimecia
"Donald Zimmerman born c. 1953 is a television analyst and former American college lacrosse coach. He became a color analyst for ESPN in May 2016 and does both high school and college lacrosse games. Prior to becoming an analyst, he served as the head coach for the UMBC Retrievers at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County for 24 years. Between 1984 and 1987, Zimmerman coached Johns Hopkins to three national championships. Zimmerman was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 2017. Zimmerman attended St. Paul's School in Brooklandville, Maryland. While there, the lacrosse team on which he played won three Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association MIAA championships. Zimmerman then attended Randolph Macon College before he transferred to Johns Hopkins University. He played lacrosse as a midfielder for the Blue Jays in 1975 and 1976. His senior year, he received honorable mention All American honors and the Turnbull Reynold Award for leadership and sportsmanship. He graduated in 1976. After graduating, Zimmerman remained at Hopkins for a season to coach the lacrosse program's B squad in 1977. He spent the following season as an assistant coach at Princeton University. From 1979 to 1982, he served as an assistant under Willie Scroggs at the University of North Carolina. While there, the Tar Heels won the national championship in 1981 and 1982. In 1983, he returned to his alma mater, and became the head coach in 1984 after the retirement of Henry Ciccarone. That year, he led the Blue Jays to a perfect 140 season and became the first head coach to win an NCAA championship in his first season. In 1985, Hopkins again won the national title while suffering one loss. The following year, the Blue Jays compiled a 102 record, and were eliminated in the semifinals in overtime by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. In 1987, Zimmerman led the team to a 103 record and a third title. Upon expiration of his contract, he left Hopkins after compiling a 65 record in 1990. The reason he cited was the pressure associated with the high profile position. In total, Zimmerman's teams at Johns Hopkins posted a 7315 record. Current Hopkins head coach Dave Pietramala spent his entire college playing career under Zimmerman, from 1986 to 1989. Former North Carolina and Hopkins head coach John Haus played for the Tar Heels under Zimmerman and then served as his assistant at Johns Hopkins. Zimmerman was the United States men's national lacrosse team's assistant coach for the 1986 World Lacrosse Championship. Zimmerman spent three years at Loyola as an assistant for the Greyhounds under Dave Cottle, before he was hired as head coach by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County UMBC . The Retrievers continued to struggle early in Zimmerman's tenure, and during his first three seasons compiled a 1425 mark. After a 39 campaign in 1996, UMBC became the most improved team in the nation with a 93 record for the 1997 season. In 1998, the Retrievers delivered a major upset by beating, 128, then first ranked Maryland, the eventual national championship runners up. The victory helped UMBC secure its first ever berth in the NCAA tournament. In 1999, the Retrievers again made an appearance in the tournament. Zimmerman coached the South squad in the 2002 North South Senior All Star Game. In 2005, UMBC posted a 51 conference mark to achieve the America East regular season conference championship. The following year, the Retrievers defeated Binghamton and Albany in the America East tournament for the conference championship, and Zimmerman made his tenth appearance as a head coach in the NCAA tournament. He was named the 2006 America East Coach of the Year. In 2007, UMBC again advanced past Binghamton before falling to Albany in the America East championship game, and secured another berth in the NCAA tournament. There, they upset seventh seeded Maryland in the first round for the school's first appearance in the NCAA quarterfinals. In 2008, UMBC again faced Albany in the America East championship game. Halfway through the second period, the Retrievers trailed 112, but rallied to edge their opponents, 1413. Zimmerman was named the 2008 America East Coach of the Year. In June, he was considered the frontrunner to replace John Haus who had been fired as North Carolina's head coach, but Zimmerman removed his name from consideration. He said, The people at UMBC have been good to me, and this is my home ... these are my kids and I recruited them. I just didn't think this was the right time to move. In 2009, UMBC captured its fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season title. In the conference semifinals, the Retrievers edged Binghamton, 98. In the final, however, UMBC jumped out to an early lead over Albany and never relinquished it, and won, 157. Zimmerman was named the 2009 America East Coach of the Year. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Retrievers faced sixth seeded North Carolina. UMBC entered the game with the number one ranked midfield in the nation, but it was lacking in depth, and the first string was thus forced to play most of the 90 F 32 C game. The Retrievers led 86 at halftime, but North Carolina assumed control during the third period and went on to win, 1513. While coach at UMBC, Zimmerman has traveled to Japan, Argentina, and the United Kingdom in order to promote the sport of lacrosse. In 2002, 2004, and 2006, UMBC hosted fall scrimmages against teams from Keio University. In the summer of 2005, the Retrievers traveled to Japan. Regarding the possibility of the sport being a future Olympic event, Zimmerman said, Its incumbent upon us to introduce and develop the game when opportunities occur in order to reach that goal. The Greater Baltimore Chapter of the United States Lacrosse Hall of Fame inducted Zimmerman on January 25, 2003. Zimmerman lives in Towson, Maryland with his wife, Dorothy. They have two adult children, a son and a daughter.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%20Zimmerman%20%28lacrosse%29
"Frederick Hinde Zimmerman October 17, 1864 September 21, 1924 was an American banker, farmer, real estate entrepreneur, businessman, and hotel owner. Due to his large land holdings and expertise in farming Zimmerman became a notable farmer, breeder, and real estate entrepreneur during his life. Zimmerman's farm, originally purchased by his grandfather Thomas S. Hinde from the federal government in 1815, included the Grand Rapids Dam, Hanging Rock, and Buttercrust. His first experience running a business was in 1883 when he ran a grocery store in Fort Smith, Arkansas with his cousin Harry Hinde. Many of Zimmerman's businesses centered on his family farm, but in later years Zimmerman achieved success through his ownership and investment in mines, banks, and real estate. He also owned or invested in the Hanging Rock and Grand Rapids Dam Farm Company, the Grand Rapids Hotel Park Company, and the Wabash Bull Frog Mines Company. Zimmerman was among the fourth generation of the Hinde family in the United States that was begun by his great grandfather Dr. Thomas Hinde. His grandfather Thomas S. Hinde was a prominent politician and Methodist minister who contributed to the development of Illinois, Indiana, and the spread of the Methodist faith. His father Jacob Zimmerman held various political offices in the state of Illinois and in his early years owned several prominent Democratic newspapers in Ohio and Illinois right before the Civil War. At the age of one, Zimmerman's mother died and he was sent away to live with family in Ohio and did not see his father again until he was fourteen. Towards the end of his life, Zimmerman was elected to various positions of leadership in the Knights of Pythias and Illinois Farmers Institute. He was elected secretary of the Illinois Farmers Institute for multiple terms. During Zimmerman's life he managed banks, his family farm in Mount Carmel Precinct, Wabash County, Illinois, the Grand Rapids Hotel near the Grand Rapids Dam, and invested in numerous business ventures. The Grand Rapids Hotel was one of his most notable accomplishments and soon after opening in 1922 attracted tourists from across the United States. The hotel was one of the largest resorts in the Wabash Valley and at one time had fishing, trap shoots, baseball, golf, boating, swimming, a restaurant, and many other recreational activities. The hotel promoted the growth of the region by increasing the number of tourists and by hosting many large scale meetings and public events like celebrations at Hallowe'en, Christmas, and the Fourth of July. He died unexpectedly from complications of a broken hip that he suffered near the Grand Rapids Hotel in 1924 after falling out of his Model T automobile. Five years after Zimmerman died, the hotel was burned to the ground. During the summer of 1929, Glenn Goodart, then manager of the hotel, burned down the hotel by dropping a blowtorch in the basement. The hotel was not rebuilt due to a lack of funds and the onset of the Great Depression. Frederick Hinde Zimmerman was born on his family farm in the Mount Carmel Precinct, Wabash County, Illinois on October 17, 1864, towards the end of the American Civil War. He was the second child of the Honorable Jacob Zimmerman, an Illinois congressman and politician from a wealthy family, and Belinda Hinde, a member of the prominent Hinde family and the daughter of Rev. Thomas S. Hinde, the founder of Mount Carmel. His parents met and were married in Marshall, Illinois while his father ran a newspaper and his mother lived with her sister Martha Hinde and her husband Judge Charles H. Constable. During the Civil War, Zimmerman's father and uncles grew tobacco and operated mills on their family's farm, a portion of which was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock, Buttercrust a natural sandbar on the Wabash River , and the Grand Rapids Dam. His mother's family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, and the majority of the land had been purchased by Thomas S. Hinde in 1815 from the federal government. Originally, the family farm had belonged to Zimmerman's mother and her siblings, but his father purchased their interests. Zimmerman's father was able to purchase the Hinde farm because he had become wealthy through his ownership of various newspapers in the preceding years. His father lived on the farm near the Grand Rapids Dam from 1860 until moving to a 160 acre farm in the southwestern part of Friendsville, Illinois in 1903. Zimmerman initially grew up in Mount Carmel, but when his mother Belinda Hinde died unexpectedly in 1865, his father sent him to live with family in Ohio. His father owned newspapers in Marshall, Illinois, and in Mount Carmel, Illinois, but by the time Zimmerman was born, he had retired from the newspaper business to focus on running the Hinde family farm and on politics. Based on an entry in Edmund C. Hinde's diaries, Zimmerman's uncle, judge Charles H. Constable, and then his mother died from morphine overdoses that may have resulted from an addiction to the drug developed during the Civil War. Shortly after the death of his mother Belinda, Zimmerman's older brother Charles died at the age of four in Wabash County, Illinois. Zimmerman stayed with his father's sisters in Ohio on a farm his grandfather Henry Zimmerman had purchased from the Wyandot Indians in the 1840s until his father married Emma Harris in 1875. Three years after the remarriage his father was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1878 and served two full terms until 1882. In 1879, aged fourteen, he returned to the family farm in Wabash County, Illinois to live with his father and step mother. Zimmerman graduated from high school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, and then worked on the family farm near the Grand Rapids Dam from 1879 until 1883, where he oversaw the farming operations and raised livestock. During his youth, Zimmerman was commonly called Freddie or Freddie boy by his family and close friends. In 1883, at the age of nineteen, Zimmerman and his cousin Harry Hinde were invited by Zimmerman's uncle Edmund C. Hinde to move to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where Hinde lived following his return from the California Gold Rush. After moving to Fort Smith, they owned and operated a grocery store from 1883 to 1886. Judge Isaac Parker at this time was in the process of eradicating the brothels, saloons, and outlaws that had taken over Fort Smith through increased public hangings and stiffer criminal penalties and this general lawless environment made operation of the grocery store difficult. This period in the history of Fort Smith, Arkansas has been memorialized in the novel True Grit, and the two movies it inspired, True Grit 1969 and True Grit 2010 . The grocery store was a failure, and they were forced to sell the business and return to Mount Carmel, Illinois, but Zimmerman remained close to his cousin Harry Hinde, who later was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives, operated several businesses, and speculated in real estate. In later years, along with their uncle Charles T. Hinde, they invested in real estate and mines in New Mexico. The New Mexico properties only returned modest profits but were kept in the family until the 1950s. After the failure of the grocery store in Arkansas in 1886, Zimmerman returned to the family farm and became a gentleman farmer. After Zimmerman returned, his father gave a small acreage of the Hinde farm to Zimmerman's half brother John H. Zimmerman, who raised pigs and farmed the acreage until he sold the property to Zimmerman several years later. Zimmerman was given title to the Hinde family farm by his father on July 13, 1902 after he married Agnes Oldendorf 18721922 . Agnes was the daughter of Peter and Mary S. Oldendorf who ran a music business and were retail liquor dealers in Mount Carmel. The brother of Zimmerman's wife, Charles Oldendorf, who served as mayor of Mount Carmel, Illinois during the late 1890s, encouraged Zimmerman to join the fraternal organization the Knights of Pythias. In 1906, Zimmerman became chancellor commander of the Knights of Pythias lodge in Wabash County, Illinois and was a Captain in the uniform rank of the order. After receiving title to the Hinde family farm in 1902, Zimmerman built a house for his young family near the Grand Rapids Dam. Once construction of the new home was completed Zimmerman used two horse teams and numerous men to lift his father's old home near the river and move it to higher ground closer to his new home. The couple had two children, Rebecca Zimmerman in 1901 and Peter Jacob Hinde Zimmerman in 1903. Zimmerman and his wife raised their children in the Methodist faith and they attended school in Mount Carmel. From his son's early years Zimmerman trained him to operate the farm land and livestock. His son won many awards in livestock shows. Following Zimmerman's death in 1924, ownership of the Grand Rapids Hotel was divided equally between his children. They owned the hotel until it was burned down in 1929 by hotel manager Glenn Goodart under suspicious circumstances. In 1901, Zimmerman was elected secretary of the Illinois Farmers' Institute, a position he held for three years. His father also held leadership positions with the Illinois Farmers' Institute and frequently gave speeches on good farming practices, the origin of soils, the road system, and climatic influence on plants. Meetings during his tenure as secretary averaged 350 participating members and a yearlong membership in 1901 cost 71.99. The district director stated that during the tenure of Zimmerman and the other officers they made the institute, ...look very attractive after they fixed it up with flags and bunting. At this time the institute members and Zimmerman were followers of the Grangers Movement, which put emphasis on families to band together to promote the economic and political well being of the community and agriculture. Zimmerman was well known for raising some of the finest trotting horses in Southern Illinois, and many of his horses were noted for their dressage ability. Zimmerman also operated a successful livestock operation that focused on raising specialty hogs and cattle. He was noted nationally as a breeder and owner of Holstein Friesian cows by the Holstein Friesian Association of America. Three of his Holstein cows Netherland Gem Segis, Kosa Beat Segis, and Vickery de Kol Korndyke were listed among the best known of the breed in herd and pedigree listings. For a short time Zimmerman and his father raised registered Shropshire sheep primarily for meat, at the family farm near the Grand Rapids Dam. Some of their Shropshire sheep were listed on the American Shropshire Registry, which was a national register for the highest quality sheep of the breed. Zimmerman's son lived on the family farm his entire life and in later years was elected to various public offices in Wabash County Illinois. Like his father, he continued the tradition of raising specialty hogs and cattle. Both men continually expanded the family land holdings and diversified the farming operations. In the early 1900s Zimmerman began to invest in other business ventures and strengthen his relationship with his uncle Captain Charles T. Hinde who at that time was living in Coronado, California, and was vice president of the Speckels Brothers Commercial Company in San Diego. Some of Zimmerman's more notable businesses were a coal mine in Indiana, a few mines in the western United States, and a company he co owned, named the Wabash Bull Frog Mines Company in Nevada and Arizona, which he invested in from August 1905. Zimmerman's father owned many coal mines in Illinois and Indiana, so in his later years, Zimmerman also invested in some of them. Zimmerman also served on the board of directors of multiple banks in the Midwest, and owned a substantial interest in The First National Bank in Mount Carmel, Illinois. Zimmerman's primary business at this time was his management of the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock Farms Company, which was organized to manage the farming operations of the family farm and the increasing number of tourists visiting its Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock sections. The Grand Rapids Dam created favorable fishing conditions, which attracted large numbers of people. Zimmerman also opened a small shop near the dam that sold goods and fishing equipment to tourists, rented boats, and conducted tours. Nick Garrett, originally a hired hand on the Zimmerman farm, managed the store for the Zimmerman family. Zimmerman's uncle Captain Charles T. Hinde, a shipping magnate who played an important role in the development of Southern California through his various investments with John D. Spreckels and E. S. Babcock, mentored Zimmerman in business strategies. Specifically, Zimmerman and Hinde discussed the Hotel del Coronado investment, which Hinde had contributed to in the late 1880s. Over the years Zimmerman often traveled to Coronado, California to visit Hinde. When Hinde died in 1915, he left Zimmerman and Harry Hinde a substantial portion of his estate. Adjusting for inflation, Zimmerman inherited millions from the estate. After the estate was settled in 1917, Zimmerman decided to use his portion of the money to establish a hotel and resort on the Hinde family farm next to the Grand Rapids Dam before he could start, he had to wait for the conclusion of World War I. Construction of the hotel likely began sometime in 1919 or 1920 and continued until the hotel was completed on August 7, 1922. A few months after the opening of the hotel, Zimmerman's wife, Agnes, died. The hotel, which was easy to access due to the railroad and Wabash River, was an immediate success and attracted people from across the country. It was advertised in many of the leading national newspapers in the United States, and eventually expanded into a full resort with golf, baseball, trap shoots, boating, and many other activities. Zimmerman chose hired laborer O.L. Rapson, who had worked at the family farm and lived in a small house next to his, as The Grand Rapids Hotel's first manager. He was fired in 1924 after the sudden death of Zimmerman and replaced by Rapson's friend Glenn Goodart at the request of Zimmerman's children. In 1929, Goodart burned the hotel to the ground by dropping a blowtorch in its basement shop it was not rebuilt due to the onset of the Great Depression and a lack of available funds. A few weeks before Zimmerman's death in 1924, he suffered a stroke. He died after an eventful day at the annual fair in Mount Carmel as he was returning to his farm at the Grand Rapids Dam on September 21, 1924. Before returning to his residence, Zimmerman, with his children, stopped by the Grand Rapids Hotel to check on the daily business. As he exited the car driven by his son, he fell and broke his hip. Even though he was treated for his injuries by Dr. G.S. Couch, Zimmerman died the next day. According to his obituary, Zimmerman died of hardening of the arteries. In his will, he left roughly seventy five percent of his estate to his son and about twenty five percent to his daughter. Some of the bank stock in The First National Bank in Mount Carmel, Illinois, Zimmerman left to his daughter caused her severe financial hardships due to the bank's failure during the Great Depression. Zimmerman is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Mount Carmel, Illinois. The burial site is located next to his father Jacob Zimmerman, his wife Agnes Zimmerman, and his longtime friend and farm hand Nick Garrett.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick%20Hinde%20Zimmerman
"Joshua Soule Zimmerman January 16, 1874 September 2, 1962 was an American lawyer, politician, and orchardist in the U.S. state of West Virginia. In the early years of the 20th century, Zimmerman served as the Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County and as a Democratic member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Zimmerman was born in La Plata to Reverend George Henry Zimmerman, a Methodist pastor and church administrator. He began his post secondary education at Roanoke College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from RandolphMacon College in 1892. He worked as a clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896 from Columbian University Law School. Following his graduation, Zimmerman opened a law office in Romney, West Virginia, in July 1896 and engaged in the practice of law there. He provided legal services to a number of companies and organizations including Capon Valley Bank, Hampshire County's Legal Advisory Board, the Hampshire County Food Administration, and Hampshire County orchard owners. Zimmerman was the secretary for the Winchester and Western Railroad. While serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was appointed by West Virginia Governor John Jacob Cornwell to serve on a West Virginia Legislature select committee charged with drafting a road transportation bill known as the West Virginia State Road Law. He was again appointed by Governor Cornwell to serve on a similar select committee following the ratification of the Good Roads Amendment of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1920. In addition to serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was the chairman of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Committee and a member of the Second District Congressional Committee he also participated in judicial, senatorial, and state conventions. Zimmerman played an active role in the commercial apple orchard industry of Hampshire County, and he operated at least three commercial orchards there. Joshua Soule Zimmerman was born on January 16, 1874, near La Plata in Charles County, Maryland, at the ancestral home of his mother, Henrietta A. Rowe Zimmerman. His father was Reverend George Henry Zimmerman, a Methodist pastor and church administrator whose family originated from an estate in Baltimore County near Baltimore, Maryland. Zimmerman's father presided over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South 18941898 . Zimmerman had two brothers Edgar Rowe Zimmerman of Ruxton, Maryland, and George Henry Zimmerman of Whitesburg, Kentucky. The pastoral profession of Zimmerman's father caused his family to relocate to a number of towns throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Zimmerman spent the majority of his youth in Woodstock and Salem, Virginia, before his father transferred to Romney, West Virginia, to preside over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Zimmerman attended Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, from 1885 to 1886, and in 1888 he began attending RandolphMacon College in Ashland, Virginia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1892. Following his graduation, Zimmerman worked briefly as a tutor on a plantation near Shelby, Mississippi. In 1893, Zimmerman accepted the position of a clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., during the second administration of President Grover Cleveland. During his three years serving in the United States Census Office, Zimmerman completed night courses in jurisprudence at Columbian University Law School, and he graduated from the institution with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896. While attending Columbian University, Zimmerman also served as editor of the 1896 Class Book and resided at 915 I Street, Northwest near Mount Vernon Square. Zimmerman was a member of the Phi Delta Theta social fraternity and of the Phi Delta Phi legal honor society. He was later made a Golden Legionnaire of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Following his graduation from Columbian University Law School, Zimmerman opened his law office in Romney, West Virginia, in July 1896 and began engaging in the practice of law there. His first legal case argued before the Hampshire County Circuit Court was West Virginia v. Smith, in which his client was charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny . Zimmerman lost this case. In Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher's History of Hampshire County, West Virginia From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present 1897 , Zimmerman was described as a young man who had made his success at the bar of Hampshire . Zimmerman's law practice expanded, and he began arguing cases in adjoining West Virginia county courts and in both the West Virginia state and United States federal courts. Only seven years after starting his law practice, Zimmerman was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County, William B. Cornwell, who had resigned from the position. Zimmerman was subsequently reelected twice to the position, and he served as Hampshire County's prosecuting attorney from 1900 until 1910 a total of nine years and three months . Zimmerman also served as one of three chancery commissioners for Hampshire County, during which he served with Christian Streit White, Robert White, and James Sloan Kuykendall. He was a member of the West Virginia Bar Association. Zimmerman was the lawyer for the Capon Valley Bank, headquartered in Wardensville, West Virginia, and provided his legal services to secure the bank's incorporation. During World War I, Zimmerman served as a member of Hampshire County's Legal Advisory Board and was the lawyer for the County Food Administration. Following the outbreak of World War I, Zimmerman registered for the draft during the registration for men aged 18 through 45 under the Selective Service Act of 1917. After the Winchester and Western Railroad Company received its charter on August 31, 1916, to build and operate a rail line connecting Wardensville and the Lost River valley of West Virginia to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Winchester, Virginia, Zimmerman served as the company's secretary. Zimmerman became a prominent leader within the Democratic Party in Hampshire County, which was the dominant political party in the county. At various times, Zimmerman served as the chairman of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Committee, a member of the Second District Congressional Committee, and attended judicial, senatorial, and state conventions. Zimmerman was nominated as the Democratic Party candidate for a seat representing Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1920. Zimmerman won the seat against Republican Party candidate C. W. Rogers in the November 1920 general election and subsequently served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1921 to 1924. Following his election, Zimmerman was made the Democratic Party's floor leader in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Zimmerman was appointed by West Virginia Governor John Jacob Cornwell to serve on a West Virginia Legislature select committee charged with drafting a road transportation bill under West Virginia Senate Joint Resolution No. 21 of May 21, 1919, known as the West Virginia State Road Law. The new West Virginia State Road Law became necessary following the authorization of a 50 million USD bond issue during the 1920 general election. Zimmerman was again appointed by Governor Cornwell to serve on a similar select committee following the ratification of the Good Roads Amendment of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1920. During the 1921 legislative session, Zimmerman was assigned to the Judiciary, Roads, and Game and Fish committees. Also during the 1921 legislative session, he sponsored the following bills Throughout his tenure in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman supported legislation that strictly enforced prohibition. Zimmerman played an active role in the commercial apple orchard industry of Hampshire County, in which he was responsible for the promotion of several of the county's orchard companies, served as an officer and legal advisor to orchard companies, and owned 150 acres 0.61 km2 of his own commercial apple orchards. In November 1906, Zimmerman, Henry Bell Gilkeson, R. W. Dailey, Jr., and P. J. Ruckman were incorporators of the Mill Mountain Orchard Company, which operated orchards along the top of Mill Creek Mountain west of Romney. According to the 1919 Census of the Commercial Apple Orchards in West Virginia published by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Zimmerman was engaged in the management of three commercial apple orchards near Romney, West Virginia Fairfax Orchard Company, which produced Stark Delicious apples Gilkeson, Hart Zimmerman Orchard, which produced York Imperial, Pennsylvania Winesap, Ben Davis, Stayman Winesap, Jonathan, Grimes Golden, and Rome Beauty apples and the Mill Mountain Orchard Company, which produced York Imperial, Stayman Winesap, Pennsylvania Winesap, Rambo, Northern Spy, Canada Red, Ben Davis, Grimes Golden, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Yellow Transparent, and Stark apples. Zimmerman married Kitty Campbell Vance on October 10, 1900, near Romney, West Virginia. Kitty Campbell Vance was the daughter of John T. and Mary Elizabeth Inskeep Vance of Romney. Zimmerman and his wife Kitty had four children Zimmerman was an active layperson in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and served as a steward of the Romney Methodist Episcopal Church, South congregations. He also served for a number of years as the superintendent of the congregation's Sunday school program. Zimmerman represented the church in the Moorefield district and at annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Despite his involvement in the Southern Methodist church, his wife Kitty and several of his children were Presbyterian. Zimmerman's wife Kitty predeceased him in 1937. He died in Williamsport, Maryland, on September 2, 1962. Zimmerman is interred with his wife Kitty at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia. He had practiced law in Romney, West Virginia, for 66 years.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua%20Soule%20Zimmerman
"Fume TWA 5 mg m3 ST 10 mg m3 Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water, and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesives, sealants, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, and first aid tapes. Although it occurs naturally as the mineral zincite, most zinc oxide is produced synthetically. ZnO is a wide bandgap semiconductor of the II VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n type. This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room temperature luminescence. Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy saving or heat protecting windows, and electronics as thin film transistors and light emitting diodes. Pure ZnO is a white powder, but in nature it occurs as the rare mineral zincite, which usually contains manganese and other impurities that confer a yellow to red color. Crystalline zinc oxide is thermochromic, changing from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. This color change is caused by a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non stoichiometric Zn1 xO, where at 800 C, x 0.00007. Zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide. It is nearly insoluble in water, but it will dissolve in most acids, such as hydrochloric acid Solid zinc oxide will also dissolve in alkalis to give soluble zincates ZnO reacts slowly with fatty acids in oils to produce the corresponding carboxylates, such as oleate or stearate. ZnO forms cement like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides. This cement was used in dentistry. ZnO also forms cement like material when treated with phosphoric acid related materials are used in dentistry. A major component of zinc phosphate cement produced by this reaction is hopeite, Zn3 PO4 24H2O. ZnO decomposes into zinc vapor and oxygen at around 1975 C with a standard oxygen pressure. In a carbothermic reaction, heating with carbon converts the oxide into zinc vapor at a much lower temperature around 950 C . Zinc oxide can react violently with aluminium and magnesium powders, with chlorinated rubber and linseed oil on heating causing fire and explosion hazard. It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give zinc sulfide. This reaction is used commercially. Zinc oxide crystallizes in two main forms, hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zincblende. The wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common. The zincblende form can be stabilized by growing ZnO on substrates with cubic lattice structure. In both cases, the zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral, the most characteristic geometry for Zn II . ZnO converts to the rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 GPa. Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no inversion symmetry reflection of a crystal relative to any given point does not transform it into itself . This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of hexagonal ZnO. The hexagonal structure has a point group 6 mm Hermann Mauguin notation or C6v Schoenflies notation , and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a 3.25 A and c 5.2 A their ratio c a 1.60 is close to the ideal value for hexagonal cell c a 1.633. As in most group II VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic Zn2 O2 with the corresponding radii of 0.074 nm for Zn2 and 0.140 nm for O2. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes. ZnO is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III V semiconductors, such as GaN. The high heat capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics. The E2 optical phonon in ZnO exhibits an unusually long lifetime of 133 ps at 10 K. Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it has been stated that ZnO has the highest piezoelectric tensor, or at least one comparable to that of GaN and AlN. This property makes it a technologically important material for many piezoelectrical applications, which require a large electromechanical coupling. ZnO has a relatively large direct band gap of 3.3 eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high temperature and high power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to 34 eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide. Most ZnO has n type character, even in the absence of intentional doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group VII elements chlorine or iodine. Reliable p type doping of ZnO remains difficult. This problem originates from low solubility of p type dopants and their compensation by abundant n type impurities. This problem is observed with GaN and ZnSe. Measurement of p type in intrinsically n type material is complicated by the inhomogeneity of samples. Current limitations to p doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n type and p type material. Known p type dopants include group I elements Li, Na, K group V elements N, P and As as well as copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p type conduction at room temperature. Electron mobility of ZnO strongly varies with temperature and has a maximum of 2000 cm2 Vs at 80 K. Data on hole mobility are scarce with values in the range 530 cm2 Vs . ZnO discs, acting as a varistor, are the active material in most surge arresters. For industrial use, ZnO is produced at levels of 105 tons per year by three main processes In the indirect or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907 C typically around 1000 C . Zinc vapor reacts with the oxygen in the air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire France in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process. The direct or American process starts with diverse contaminated zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by products. The zinc precursors are reduced carbothermal reduction by heating with a source of carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process as compared to the indirect one. A small amount of industrial production involves wet chemical processes, which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800 C. Numerous specialised methods exist for producing ZnO for scientific studies and niche applications. These methods can be classified by the resulting ZnO form bulk, thin film, nanowire , temperature low , that is close to room temperature or high , that is T 1000 C , process type vapor deposition or growth from solution and other parameters. Large single crystals many cubic centimeters can be grown by the gas transport vapor phase deposition , hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc. Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide. Nanostructures of ZnO can be synthesized into a variety of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor liquid solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90 C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition such as the zinc concentration and pH or to the thermal treatment such as the temperature and heating rate . Aligned ZnO nanowires on pre seeded silicon, glass, and gallium nitride substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre seeding methods include in situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles and the use of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye sensitized solar cells and field emission devices. Zinc compounds were probably used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is mentioned in the Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides 1st century AD . Galen suggested treating ulcerating cancers with zinc oxide, as did Avicenna in his The Canon of Medicine. Zinc oxide is no longer used for treating skin cancer, though it is still used as an ingredient in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments. The Romans produced considerable quantities of brass an alloy of zinc and copper as early as 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is thought to have been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from the second half of the first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass. From the 12th to the 16th century zinc and zinc oxide were recognized and produced in India using a primitive form of the direct synthesis process. From India, zinc manufacture moved to China in the 17th century. In 1743, the first European zinc smelter was established in Bristol, United Kingdom. The main usage of zinc oxide zinc white was in paints and as an additive to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 but it did not mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur bearing air, it is non toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so clean it is valuable for making tints with other colors, but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years. In recent times, most zinc oxide was used in the rubber industry to resist corrosion. In the 1970s, the second largest application of ZnO was photocopying. High quality ZnO produced by the French process was added to photocopying paper as a filler. This application was soon displaced by titanium. The applications of zinc oxide powder are numerous, and the principal ones are summarized below. Most applications exploit the reactivity of the oxide as a precursor to other zinc compounds. For material science applications, zinc oxide has high refractive index, high thermal conductivity, binding, antibacterial and UV protection properties. Consequently, it is added into materials and products including plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, rubber, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesive, sealants, concrete manufacturing, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, etc. Between 50 and 60 of ZnO use is in the rubber industry. Zinc oxide along with stearic acid is used in the vulcanization of rubber ZnO additive also protect rubber from fungi see medical applications and UV light. Ceramic industry consumes a significant amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefficient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary flux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated influence. Zinc oxide as a mixture with about 0.5 iron III oxide Fe2O3 is called calamine and is used in calamine lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been historically called calamine. When mixed with eugenol, a ligand, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry. Reflecting the basic properties of ZnO, fine particles of the oxide have deodorizing and antibacterial properties and for that reason are added into materials including cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles. Zinc oxide is widely used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, itching due to eczema, diaper rash and acne. It is used in products such as baby powder and barrier creams to treat diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments. It is also a component in tape called zinc oxide tape used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. Zinc oxide can be used in ointments, creams, and lotions to protect against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet light see sunscreen . It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA , and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA 320400 nm and UVB 280320 nm rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin. Many sunscreens use nanoparticles of zinc oxide along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore do not appear white. There has been concern that they might be absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23 to 1.31 mean 0.42 of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption can be found in the literature. Zinc oxide nanoparticles can enhance the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It has been shown that nano ZnO which has the average size between 20 nm and 45 nm can enhance the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell. Zinc oxide is a component of cigarette filters. A filter consisting of charcoal impregnated with zinc oxide and iron oxide removes significant amounts of hydrogen cyanide HCN and hydrogen sulfide H2S from tobacco smoke without affecting its flavor. Zinc oxide is added to many food products, including breakfast cereals, as a source of zinc, a necessary nutrient. Zinc sulfate is also used for the same purpose. Some prepackaged foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient. Zinc oxide was linked to dioxin contamination in pork exports in the 2008 Chilean pork crisis. The contamination was found to be due to dioxin contaminated zinc oxide used in pig feed. Zinc white is used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than lithopone, but less opaque than titanium dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists' pigments. The use of zinc white zinc oxide as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century. It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Bocklin, Van Gogh, Manet, Munch and others. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup CI 77947 . Micronized and nano scale zinc oxide and titanium dioxide provide strong protection against UVA and UVB ultraviolet radiation, and are used in suntan lotion, and also in UV blocking sunglasses for use in space and for protection when welding, following research by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL . Paints containing zinc oxide powder have long been utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years. ZnO highly n type doped with aluminium, gallium, or indium is transparent and conductive transparency 90 , lowest resistivity 104 cm . ZnO Al coatings are used for energy saving or heat protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared IR radiation back into the room energy saving or does not let the IR radiation into the room heat protection , depending on which side of the window has the coating. Plastics, such as polyethylene naphthalate PEN , can be protected by applying zinc oxide coating. The coating reduces the diffusion of oxygen with PEN. Zinc oxide layers can also be used on polycarbonate in outdoor applications. The coating protects polycarbonate from solar radiation, and decreases its oxidation rate and photo yellowing. Zinc oxide depleted in 64Zn the zinc isotope with atomic mass 64 is used in corrosion prevention in nuclear pressurized water reactors. The depletion is necessary, because 64Zn is transformed into radioactive 65Zn under irradiation by the reactor neutrons. Zinc oxide ZnO is used as a pretreatment step to remove hydrogen sulfide H2S from natural gas following hydrogenation of any sulfur compounds prior to a methane reformer, which can poison the catalyst. At temperatures between about 230430 C 446806 F , H2S is converted to water by the following reaction The zinc sulfide ZnS is replaced with fresh zinc oxide when the zinc oxide has been consumed. ZnO has wide direct band gap 3.37 eV or 375 nm at room temperature . Therefore, its most common potential applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes LEDs . Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap 3.4 eV at room temperature . Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy 60 meV, 2.4 times of the room temperature thermal energy , which results in bright room temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate in the field of random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source. The pointed tips of ZnO nanorods result in a strong enhancement of an electric field. Therefore, they can be used as field emitters. Aluminium doped ZnO layers are used as transparent electrodes. The components Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used indium tin oxide ITO . One application which has begun to be commercially available is the use of ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays. Transparent thin film transistors TTFT can be produced with ZnO. As field effect transistors, they even may not need a pn junction, thus avoiding the p type doping problem of ZnO. Some of the field effect transistors even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels. Zinc oxide nanorod sensors are devices detecting changes in electric current passing through zinc oxide nanowires due to adsorption of gas molecules. Selectivity to hydrogen gas was achieved by sputtering Pd clusters on the nanorod surface. The addition of Pd appears to be effective in the catalytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen, increasing the sensitivity of the sensor device. The sensor detects hydrogen concentrations down to 10 parts per million at room temperature, whereas there is no response to oxygen. ZnO has also been considered for spintronics applications if doped with 110 of magnetic ions Mn, Fe, Co, V, etc. , ZnO could become ferromagnetic, even at room temperature. Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO Mn has been observed, but it is not clear yet whether it originates from the matrix itself or from secondary oxide phases. The piezoelectricity in textile fibers coated in ZnO have been shown capable of fabricating self powered nanosystems with everyday mechanical stress from wind or body movements. In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology reported producing an electricity generating device called flexible charge pump generator delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires. This mini generator creates an oscillating voltage up to 45 millivolts, converting close to seven percent of the applied mechanical energy into electricity. Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.20.3 mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size. ZnO is a promising anode material for lithium ion battery because it is cheap, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly. ZnO has a higher theoretical capacity 978 mAh g1 than many other transition metal oxides such as CoO 715 mAh g1 , NiO 718 mAh g1 and CuO 674 mAh g1 . As a food additive, zinc oxide is on the U.S. FDA's list of generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, substances. Zinc oxide itself is non toxic however it is hazardous to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass is close to the boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized zinc plated steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc%20oxide
"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara transl. You Don't Live Twice pronunciation helpinfo is a 2011 Indian buddy road film that was directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment. The film features an ensemble cast consisting of Hrithik Roshan, Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Katrina Kaif, and Kalki Koechlin. It was filmed in Spain, India, Egypt, and the United Kingdom on a budget of 550 million US 8.0 million . The music and score were composed by ShankarEhsaanLoy with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The film's story follows three childhood friends, Arjun, Kabir, and Imraan, who reunite for a three week road trip. They set off to Spain and meet Laila, who falls in love with Arjun and helps him overcome his compulsion to work. Kabir and his fiancee Natasha experience significant misunderstandings. During their trip, each friend chooses a dangerous sport for the group to partake in. The release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was initially planned for 27 May 2011 but technical problems with post production work led to the release being postponed to 24 June and again to 15 July that year. The film had a worldwide release in 1,800 screens and was a critical and commercial success that grossed 1.53 billion US 22 million and received critical acclaim for its performances, story, music, humour, and direction. After its theatrical run, the film was nominated for and won several awards, including two National Film Awards. Kabir, a part of a family construction business, proposes to his girlfriend Natasha. Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran, an advertisement copy writer and Arjun, a financial broker who is working in London. Kabir says the three friends have a long standing pact, and that during the road trip each of them will pick an adventure sport that all three will try together. Arjun is initially reluctant to take the trip as he does not want to miss work. Imran secretly plans to find his estranged biological father Salman Habib, an artist who lives in Spain. The three men fly to Spain separately and meet in Barcelona. They plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir are annoyed when Arjun, a workaholic, continues working. Imran casually throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car, causing an argument in which Arjun accuses Imran of having an affair four years prior with Arjun's then girlfriend Sonali. However, the argument is ceased by Kabir who pacifies them both. Upon reaching their destination, they meet Laila, an Anglo Indian woman Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir announces he has chosen underwater diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila to overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Laila suggests they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Bunol. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort. Imran spends time with Laila's friend Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the men leave, both Arjun and Laila realise they have fallen in love and to not regret the partition, Laila chases them on a bike, kissing Arjun passionately before saying goodbye. On their way to Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran discuss that something is wrong between the couple. The trio then visit Seville for skydiving, which is Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part, but does so. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight Imran calls Salman, who bails them out and takes them to his home. Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with children but Imran's mother Rahila did. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years ago. He apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug. The three men learn of the Running of the bulls in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice, baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran contacts Laila, who joins them. When confronted by his friends, Kabir admits to the others that he does not love Natasha and is not ready for marriage. He reveals that Natasha had mistaken a ring he had bought as a birthday present for his mother as a proposal ring for herself. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make another pact if they survive the event, Imran vows to publish the poetry he has written in his diary, Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha he does not want to marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, their families and friends, and themselves. During the credits, Imran, Kabir, Nuria and Natasha attend Arjun and Laila's wedding in Morocco. Natasha is still friends with Kabir, and Imran's poems are revealed to have been published. Anupam Kher filmed scenes as Imran's stepfather, but they did not make the theatrical cut. In November 2009, director writer Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti completed the scripting of a film after three months of work. The script had the working title Running with the Bulls, before the title Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was finalised, the new title being an amendment of the line Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara from the title song of Rock On 2008 . Akhtar and Kagti incorporated real life observations and wrote the character of Imran for the former's brother Farhan, who wrote the dialogue for the film. Farhan produced the film with Ritesh Sidhwani under Excel Entertainment. The theme of the film was three guys on the verge of making commitments in life , according to him. They used Farhan's father Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voiceover because they felt the poetry added depth to the characters and lent voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was written for Katrina Kaif's character after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal photography was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain because the climax features the running of bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture, and sports. The film's release date was postponed twice because its original editor Chandan Arora fell ill and they had to re edit it. Initially, the producers wanted Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor to play two of the three leads, but they declined without specifying a reason. Farhan Akhtar had worked with Zoya on her debut film Luck by Chance and also wrote dialogue for the film Zoya felt he would know exactly what she wanted from the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film. Farhan Akhtar defined his role as a fun character and a guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously . Hrithik Roshan was chosen for another lead role because he was one of Zoya's favourite actors. After finalising the two, she needed someone who could not just fit in with them visually but also bring something new to the table. She sought Abhay Deol for the role, as he was her friend and had worked with her before in Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. For the role of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an accent who would be willing to scuba dive, and was a half Indian and half Caucasian woman. A lot of women were auditioned for the part in New York and London. Later, at a party, Zoya met Katrina Kaif and chose her for the role. Her role was described as a free spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature . Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki Koechlin ever since seeing her in Dev.D and That Girl in Yellow Boots she felt Koechlin would suit the character of Natasha because she had the sense of comedy, but not over the top . Spanish actress Ariadna Cabrol was chosen for the role of Nuria because Zoya liked her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloise's Lover. Principal photography began in June 2010 and took place in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Mumbai, and in Spain at Barcelona, Pamplona, Bunol and Andalusia. Cinematographer Carlos Catalan, who had worked with Zoya on Luck by Chance, wanted all three lead actors to appear tanned because he didn't want everything glossed over and wanted to make the film as realistic as possible. Kaif's introduction scene was shot on a nudist beach during the filming, the crew asked beach goers stay out of the frame to avoid objections from the Central Board of Film Certification. The La Tomatina festival of Bunol was re created for the song Ik Junoon almost sixteen tons of tomatoes worth 10 million US 140,000 were flown in from Portugal for the scene. A scene involving a kiss between Roshan and Kaif was filmed despite the couple's reluctance to do so. The filming of the flamenco song Senorita took place in Alajar, a town in the province of Huelva. The crew warned local residents about the song's volume because the scene was filmed at night. On the third day of filming, locals dressed in costumes attended and the mayor of Alajar joined them. The climax of the film, which features the Running of the bulls, was filmed at Pamplona. The final schedules were at Vashi and Alibag in Mumbai in December 2010. Composer trio ShankarEhsaanLoy, who had worked with Farhan Akhtar in Rock On and Karthik Calling Karthik, composed the soundtrack for the film. The lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar. The composers engaged Maria del Mar Fernandez, a Spanish flamenco singer, to perform the vocals on Senorita her film singing debut. The song is also the singing debut of Abhay Deol, who sang it along with the other lead actors Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar. The trailer of the film was revealed with the prints of Ready, and was released online on 15 May 2011. Excel Entertainment partnered with Aircel to make promotional videos for the film available on mobile phones and the Internet. The trailer was watched over 55 million times within 48 hours of its release. Two more videosone each for the songs Ik Junoon and Senorita were released on 27 May. The music launch and promotion event took place at Nirmal Lifestyle, Mulund, Mumbai. Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani visited Facebook India to promote the film. A press conference promoting the film was held on 1 July at Chandigarh. Two dialogue promos of the film were released on 3 July. On 7 July the cast and crew embarked on a road trip from Mumbai to Delhi via Surat, Vadodra, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Ajmer and Jaipur that culminated in a concert at Gurgaon. It is believed that British Auto manufacturer Land Roverwhich is now owned by Tata Motorssponsored the Land Rover Discovery driven by the cast members during the trip. A premier at the 12th IIFA Awards before the worldwide release was planned but was not executed. The film's marketers released branded promotional items with Mountain Dew, Gillette and ING Vysya Bank. A mobile video game based on Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and the La Tomatina festival was released by Jump Games on 19 July 2011 for popular mobile operating systems. OPIUM Eyewear launched exclusive Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara sunglasses to promote the film. The release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was initially scheduled for 27 May 2011, but was postponed to 24 June and again to 15 July 2011. It was released in 1,800 screens worldwide. A special screening of the film was held at the residence of Shah Rukh Khan on 16 July, the birthday of Katrina Kaif. The event was attended by several celebrities, including the film's cast and crew. The far right political party Shiv Sena criticised the event because it was held three days after the 2011 Mumbai bombings. The producers of the film donated the collections of the film from around 10 theatres in Mumbai to the Maharashtra government as a mark of charity to the victims of the bombings. On 24 March 2012, ZNMD was screened at Bucks New University in High Wycombe, England. The film was released on DVD on 30 August 2011. It is available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and stereo formats with English and Arabic subtitles. The film is also available on Blu ray disc. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. Based on ten reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 91 with an average rating of 7.9 10. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph called Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara a beautifully scripted journey of catharsis and praised director Zoya Akhtar for being fearless in the way she shoots . In his review for Hindustan Times, Mayank Shekhar gave the film four stars praised the film as a game changer for Hindi films since Dil Chahta Hai, and wrote, What you take home are memorable, amusing moments of three truly adventurous amigos we've all grown up with. And will continue to. Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 4 stars. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 5, calling it a film for a more evolved, mature and cinema literate audience that's geared up to embrace and support newer genres of cinema . Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 5 stars and lauded its lead performances If Abhay is the anchor of the group, Farhan's funster role is full of beans and Hrithik's metamorphosis from uptight, money minded stock broker to carefree vagabond is a class act . S. Chatterjee of NDTV, gave the film 3 5 stars and said its philosophy is quite old he praised Zoya Akhtar's direction, stating, Zoya Akhtar, by investing the tale with a delightful lightness of touch and dollops of gentle wit, brings a degree of freshness to bear upon the plot . Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff rated the film 3.5 5 stars and wrote that Zoya Akhtar had put together a familiar plot but the film's fresh energy is entertaining. He wrote, Akhtar's invigorating characters pump in fresh energy into a film that could have been strictly mediocre . Kaveree Bamzai of India Today also praised for Akhtar's direction and said, By the time I finished watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara I was convinced that no one can make a romance as beautifully as a woman , giving the film 4 stars. Subhash K Jha rated Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara 3.5 5 and wrote Zoya, God bless her aesthetics, sucks us into the beauty of the moment, not giving us any reason to believe that life's most precious truths are swathed in squalor . Blessy Chettiar of DNA India praised the music and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film, saying, For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep sea diving at Costa Brava, sky diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls , giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN stated, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light hearted tone of a fun, all boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts . He also praised the performances, highlighting them as one of the main positives of the film, but also said the film's length sucks some fun of out of the ride and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. Raja Sen of Rediff said the film tried too hard to be cool and gave it 1.5 5 stars. Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian was broadly positive about the film he wrote, It's still playing to full houses, and you can see why. Slick it may be. But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie are not the only ones who will come out grinning , and that he found the movie stubbornly un macho for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review wrote Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill conceived masala mash up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel good movies of the year . In India, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released alongside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. It opened well in the multiplexes the occupancy ranged from 70 to 100 percent, despite receiving average opening in single screen cinemas except in the metro cities. The film grossed 525 million US 7.6 million in its opening three day weekend, including 73.9 million US 1.1 million on its first day, and a net total of 265 million US 3.8 million on the third day. After ten days of worldwide showings it grossed 1.08 billion US 16 million . In 17 days, it grossed over 700 million US 10 million in India. With no significant competition other than Singham, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara remained No. 2 at the box office for four weeks after its release. It was one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2011 in India and internationally it was declared a super hit in India and in overseas territories. Outside India, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara grossed 120 million US 1.7 million in three days, which made it the biggest opening for an Indian film in 2011. The film reached top twenty lists in the US and UK. It grossed 896,289 in UK, US 3,103,656 in the US, AU 387,384 in Australia and NZ 136,380 in New Zealand. As of January 2012, the film has grossed 7.25 million overseas. The film grossed 1.53 billion US 22 million worldwide, surpassing the worldwide gross of Hrithik Roshan's Dhoom 2 and becoming the ninth highest worldwide grossing Bollywood film of all time as of October 2011. After the release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA objected to the bull running scene and sought support from fans via their Twitter page to ban the film. PETA spokesperson Poorva Joshipura spoke about the event and said, We will now be contacting the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Central Board of Film Certification to take action . The film's producer Ritesh Sidhwani said, We had submitted all the papers to the Animal Welfare Board India that stated that none of the animals were injured or hurt in any way and only then, the censor board cleared the movie. We are only showing the culture of Spain. Spanish American artist Charo sent a letter to Zoya Akhtar on behalf of PETA asking her to remove all of the scenes related to the running of the bulls. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara won two awards at the 59th National Film Awards in the Best Audiography and Best Choreography categories. It also won several awards at regional ceremonies, mainly for the 'Best Film' and 'Best Director' these include the Filmfare Awards, Stardust Awards, Zee Cine Awards, IIFA Awards, Screen Awards, and the Asian Film Awards. Following the film's release, Zoya Akhtar said she had an idea of making a sequel to Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara she said, You never know, I might or may not make a sequel. It all depends on the right content. It has been reported that the actors are expected to reprise their roles in the sequel if it is officially launched. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Roshan said the plot of the sequel could be set five or six years after the events depicted in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and that the characters would be older and would have a reason to go on another trip. As of August 2011 , no official confirmation of a sequel had been announced, despite requests from many viewers. After the IIFA ceremony, Farhan Akhtar said there was no necessity for a sequel. Later in 2013, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Zoya Akhtar expressed interest in writing for the sequel after completing the filming of her next project, Dil Dhadakne Do, which was released in June 2015, although in February 2019 she said, Honestly, people want a second movie of ZNMD, but I think the best franchise would either be Luck By Chance or Dil Dhadakne Do.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara
"Zinfandel also known as Primitivo is a variety of black skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kastelanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia the heel of Italy , where it was introduced in the 18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid 19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely Zierfandler from Austria. The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi sweet rose blush style wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent. The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier ripening Primitivo clone. Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of Vitis vinifera occurred in the Caucasus region around 6000 BCE, and winemaking was discovered shortly after that. Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the Mediterranean and surrounding regions. Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel, which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century. This diversity suggests that the grapes have been grown in Croatia longer than anywhere else. These varieties were almost entirely wiped out, however, by the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century, eventually reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally known Crljenak Kastelanski discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. The first documented use of the term Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 years after the first documented use of the term Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin. Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into the Apulia region of Italy in the 18th century. Don Francesco Filippo Indellicati, the priest of the church at Gioia del Colle near Bari, selected an early primo ripening plant of the Zagarese variety and planted it in Liponti. This clone ripened at the end of August and became widespread throughout northern Apulia. Cuttings came to the other great Primitivo DOC denominazione di origine controllata or denomination of controlled origin as part of the dowry of the Countess Sabini of Altamura when she married Don Tommaso Schiavoni Tafuri of Manduria in the late 19th century. The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in Vienna, Austria, which probably obtained the vines during the Habsburg Monarchy's rule over Croatia, which was expanded when Austria acquired the Dalmatian territories of the former Republic of Venice in 1797. George Gibbs, a horticulturist on Long Island, received shipments of grapes from Schonbrunn and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829. Sullivan suggests that the Black Zinfardel of Hungary mentioned by William Robert Prince in A Treatise on the Vine 1830 may have referred to one of Gibbs's 1829 acquisitions. Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian tzinifandli czirifandli , which derives from the German Zierfandler, a white grape Gruner Sylvaner from Austria's Thermenregion. Gibbs visited Boston in 1830, and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling Zenfendal soon afterward. In 1830, Gibbs also supplied Prince with Black St. Peters , a similar variety that may have come from England, where many vines have St. Peters in their names. Little is known about this vine, except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s. By 1835 Charles M. Hovey, Bostons leading nurseryman, was recommending Zinfindal as a table grape, and it was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses for the production of table grapes as early as June. The first reference to making wine from Zinfindal appears in John Fisk Allen's Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine 1847 . Meanwhile, the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the Concord and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston. Prince and other nurserymen such as Frederick W. Macondray joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, and took Zinfandel with them. Prince's notebook records that the grape dried perfectly to Raisin and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the Black Sonora he found in California. When the vine known as Black St. Peters arrived in California, it was initially regarded as a distinct variety, but by the 1870s it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel. Joseph W. Osborne may have made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, and by the end of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California. These Zinfandel old vines are now treasured for the production of premium red wine, but many were ripped up in the 1920s, during the Prohibition years 19201933 , but not for the obvious reason. Even during the Prohibition, home winemaking remained effectively legal, and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home. While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets. The thick skinned Alicante Bouschet was less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market. In 1931, 3000 cars about 38,000 short tons 34,000 t of Zinfandel grapes were shipped, compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet. By 1930, the wine industry had weakened due to the Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines. By the middle of the 20th century the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten. In 1972, one British wine writer wrote, there is a fascinating Californian grape, the zinfandel, said to have come from Hungary, but apparently a cepage now unknown there. In 1974 and 1981, American wine writers described it as a California original, grown nowhere else and California's own red grape . In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery decided to try draining some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it under the name of Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saignee method. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation, so he added White Zinfandel to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make white wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Rose had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9 of U.S. wine sales by volume 6.3 by value , six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley. Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, the success of this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same red grapes, processed in a different way. Zinfandel was long considered America's vine and wine , but when University of California, Davis UCD professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967, he noticed how wine made from Primitivo reminded him of Zinfandel. Others also made the connection about that time. Primitivo was brought to California in 1968, and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972. The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel. In 1975, PhD student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints. Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel, among them Croatian born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers ZAP with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb. In 1993, Meredith used a DNA fingerprinting technique to confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel are clones of the same variety. Comparative field trials have found that Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel, having earlier fruit maturity, similar or higher yield, and similar or lower bunch rot susceptibility. This is consistent with the theory that Primitivo was selected as an early ripening clone of a Croatian grape. By 1998, Meredith's team realized that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel but rather that one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejic and Edi Maletic University of Zagreb to be Dobricic, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Solta. This discovery narrowed down the search to the central Dalmatian coastal strip and its offshore islands. Eventually a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples. The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica Radunic in Kastel Novi. This Crljenak Kastelanski Kastela Red appears to represent Primitivo Zinfandel in its original home, although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation. Meredith now refers to the variety as ZPC Zinfandel Primitivo Crljenak Kastelanski. This Croatian vineyard contained just nine Crljenak Kastelanski vines mixed with thousands of other vines. In 2002, additional vines known locally as Pribidrag were found in the Dalmatian coastal town of Omis. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletic in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors. In the 2012 book Wine Grapes Masters of wine Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. Jose Vouillamoz detail the search for Zinfandel's origins. After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe, a single 90 year old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in Split, Croatia, provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that has been known as Tribidrag since at least the 15th century. Local wine labeling regulations are slowly catching up with the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers have taken advantage of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB . As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as approved grape varieties for American wines, but they are not listed as synonyms U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ATF proposed in 2002 that they be recognized as synonyms. In July 2008, the proposed regulation RIN 1513AA32, formerly RIN 1512 AC65 was withdrawn. Zinfandel is grown across the continental United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from late harvest dessert wines, roses White Zinfandel and Beaujolais style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine in the style of port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker. Historically, California Zinfandel vines were planted as a field blend interspersed with Durif Petite Sirah , Carignan, Grenache, Mourvedre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes particularly Petite Sirah in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11 of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons 350,000 tonnes are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot. In California, 20 of the Zinfandel growing counties hold 80 of the Zinfandel growing area however, major producing areas such as San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Madera County produce Zinfandel primarily for blends or jug wine. Certain California regions are regarded as exceptional for Zinfandel, each with identifiable flavor characteristics Most Primitivo is grown in Apulia, a coastal region known as the heel of Italy, and it is estimated to be the country's 12th most widely planted grape variety. The main three DOC areas are Primitivo di Manduria, Gioia del Colle Primitivo Riserva and Falerno del Massico Primitivo Riserva o Vecchio . The Manduria DOC covers still red wine as well as sweet Dolce Naturale and fortified Liquoroso Dolce Naturale, Liquoroso Secco wine. Falerno requires a minimum of 85 Primitivo the others are 100 Primitivo. Gioia del Colle Rosso and Rosato contain 5060 Primitivo, and Cilento Rosso Rosato contains around 15 . Historically, the grape was fermented and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, where it was used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16 alcohol by volume ABV . Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American style Zinfandel. The Croatian form Crljenak Kastelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its own right before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletic in Croatia, which he planted on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the government has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kastelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008. Old vine Zinfandel plantings dating from the 1930s have been found in Baja California, Mexico. There are also small Zinfandel plantings in Western Australia, Mudgee in New South Wales and the McLaren Vale area of South Australia. South Africa has a small production of Zinfandel, including one estate rated among the country's Zinfandel producers and winner of an international prize. Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in climates that are warm but not too hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill. The grapes exhibit an uneven pattern of ripening a single bunch may contain both raisin like, over ripe grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness, while others hand harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in the high cost of some Zinfandels. Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too hot too alcoholic , although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable. On the other hand, Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol removing technologies, such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones, remove a sense of terroir from the wine. If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15 alcohol, Peterson argues, it should be accepted on its own terms. Factors that affect the wine's flavors include length of fermentation, length of the maceration period with skin contact, the level of oak aging, and the degrees Brix of the harvested grapes. White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much varietal character, though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin. At 23Bx the degree that most red wine is considered ripe , strawberry flavors develop. Cherry flavors appear at 24Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25Bx.

"Walter Henry Zinn December 10, 1906 February 14, 2000 was an American nuclear physicist who was the first director of the Argonne National Laboratory from 1946 to 1956. He worked at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory during World War II, and supervised the construction of Chicago Pile 1, the world's first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942, at the University of Chicago. At Argonne he designed and built several new reactors, including Experimental Breeder Reactor I, the first nuclear reactor to produce electric power, which went live on December 20, 1951. Walter Henry Zinn was born in Berlin now Kitchener , Ontario, on December 10, 1906, the son of John Zinn, who worked in a tire factory, and Maria Anna Stoskopf. He had an older brother, Albert, who also became a factory worker. Zinn entered Queen's University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1927 and a Master of Arts degree in 1930. He then entered Columbia University in 1930, where he studied physics, writing his Doctor of Philosophy thesis on Two crystal study of the structure and width of K X ray absorption limits . This was subsequently published in the Physical Review. To support himself, Zinn taught at Queen's University from 1927 to 1928, and at Columbia from 1931 to 1932. He became an instructor at the City College of New York in 1932. While at Queen's he met Jennie A. Jean Smith, a fellow student. They were married in 1933 and had two sons, John Eric and Robert James. In 1938, Zinn became a naturalised United States citizen. In 1939, the Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia where Zinn worked were the center of intensive research into the properties of uranium and nuclear fission, which had recently been discovered by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. At Columbia, Zinn, Enrico Fermi, Herbert L. Anderson , John R. Dunning and Leo Szilard investigated whether uranium 238 fissioned with slow neutrons, as Fermi believed, or only the uranium 235 isotope, as Niels Bohr contended. Since pure uranium 235 was not available, Fermi and Szilard chose to work with natural uranium. They were particularly interested in whether a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated. This would require more than one neutron to be emitted per fission on average in order to keep the chain reaction going. By March 1939, they established that about two were being emitted per fission on average. The delay between an atom absorbing a neutron and fission occurring would be the key to controlling a chain reaction. At this point Zinn began working for Fermi, constructing experimental uranium lattices. To slow neutrons down requires a neutron moderator. Water was Fermi's first choice, but it tended to absorb neutrons as well as slow them. In July, Szilard suggested using carbon, in the form of graphite. The critical radius of a spherical reactor was calculated to be In order for a self sustaining nuclear chain reaction to occur, they needed k 1. For a practical reactor configuration, it needed to be at least 3 or 4 percent more but in August 1941 Zinn's initial experiments indicated a disappointing value of 0.87. Fermi pinned his hopes of a better result on an improved configuration, and purer uranium and graphite. In early 1942, with the United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton concentrated the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k. By December 1942, Zinn and Anderson had the new configuration ready at Stagg Field. Some 24 feet 7.3 m long, 24 feet 7.3 m wide and 19 feet 5.8 m high, it contained 385.5 long tons 391.7 t of graphite and 46.5 long tons 47.2 t of uranium metal and uranium oxide. When the experiment was carried out on the afternoon of December 2, 1942, the reactor, known as Chicago Pile 1, reached criticality without incident. Since the reactor had no radiation shield, it was run at a maximum power of only 200 W, enough to power a light bulb, and ran for only three months. It was shut down on February 28, 1943, because the US Army did not want to risk an accident near densely populated downtown Chicago. The Army leased a 1,000 acres 400 ha of the Cook County Forest Preserves known as Site A to the Manhattan Project, and the Country Club to the hundred or so scientists, guards and others who worked there. Zinn was placed in charge of Site A, under Fermi. Chicago Pile 1 was disassembled and rebuilt, this time with a radiation shield, at Site A. The reactor, now known as Chicago Pile 2, was operational again on March 20, 1943. Within a few months, Fermi began designing a new reactor, which became known as Chicago Pile 3. This was a very different type of reactor. It was much smaller, being only 6 feet 1.8 m in diameter and 9 feet 2.7 m high. It was power by 120 uranium metal rods, and moderated by 1,200 US gallons 4,500 l 1,000 imp gal of heavy water. Once again Zinn was in charge of construction, which commenced on New Year's Day in 1944. Chicago Pile 3 went critical on May 15, 1944, and commenced operation on June 23 at its full power of 300 KW. When Fermi departed for the Hanford Site, Zinn became the sole authority at Site A. On September 29, 1944, Zinn received an urgent call from Samuel Allison, the director of the Metallurgical Laboratory. The B Reactor at Hanford had shut down shortly after reaching full power, only to come back to life again some hours later. Norman Hilberry suspected a neutron poison was responsible. If so, it had a half life of around 9.7 hours. Xenon 135 had a half life close to that, but had not been detected in Argonne or by the X 10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Zinn quickly brought Chicago Pile 3 up to full power, and within twelve hours, had made a series of measurements that confirmed the Hanford results. Over the following months, some 175 technical personnel were transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to Hanford and Los Alamos. Zinn's Argonne Laboratory was reduced to a skeleton staff, but Compton would not countenance its closure. On July 11, 1946, the Argonne laboratory officially became the Argonne National Laboratory, with Zinn as its first director. Alvin Weinberg characterized Zinn as a model of what a director of the then emerging national laboratories should be sensitive to the aspirations of both contractor and fund provider, but confident enough to prevail when this was necessary. One of the first problems confronting Zinn was that of accommodation. The Federal government had promised to restore Site A to the Cook County Forest Preserves after the war, and despite intervention from the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, the most the Cook County Forest Preserves Commission would agree to was that the Argonne National Laboratory could continue to occupy a portion of the lease until a new site was found. Zinn rejected alternate sites outside the Chicago area, and the Army found a new site for the laboratory's permanent home about 5 miles 8.0 km away in DuPage County, Illinois, which became known as Site D. Under Zinn, the Argonne National Laboratory adopted slightly more progressive hiring practices than other contemporary institutions. Three African American women and seven men, six of whom had worked on the Manhattan Project, were employed in research at Argonne at a time when the Los Alamos National Laboratory had no African American scientists. Argonne also appointed women to positions of authority, with Maria Goeppert Mayer as a section leader in the theoretical physics division, and Hoylande Young as director of the technical information division. The Atomic Energy Commission AEC replaced the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947, and on January 1, 1948 it announced that the Argonne National Laboratory would be focused chiefly on problems of reactor development. Zinn did not seek the additional responsibility, which he realised would divert the Laboratory away from research, and divert him from other responsibilities, such as designing a fast breeder reactor. He even obtained a written assurance from Carroll L. Wilson, the AEC's general manager, that it would not. He was therefore willing to collaborate with Alvin Weinberg to allow the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to remain involved in reactor design. Nonetheless, reactor research accounted for almost half the laboratory's budget in 1949, and 84 percent of its research was classified. Zinn did not get along well with Captain Hyman G. Rickover, the US Navy's Director of Naval Reactors, but nonetheless Argonne assisted in the development of nuclear marine propulsion, eventually producing two reactors, a land based prototype Mark I and a propulsion reactor, the Mark II. The STR Submarine Thermal Reactor pressurized water reactor designed at Argonne powered the first nuclear powered submarine, USS Nautilus, and became the basis of nearly all the reactors installed in warships. The other branch of reactor development at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the one closer to Zinn's heart, was the fast breeder reactor. At the time it was believed that uranium was a scarce resource, so it would be wise to make the best use of it. The breeders were designed to create more fissile material than they consumed. By 1948, he had become convinced that it would be unwise to build large experimental reactors near Chicago, and the AEC acquired land around Arco, Idaho, which became an outpost of Argonne. The Experimental Breeder Reactor I EBR I, but known at Argonne as ZIP Zinn's Infernal Pile was the first reactor to be cooled by liquid metal, and the first to produce electricity. It proved the breeder concept. AEC Chairman Gordon Dean described it as a major milestone in nuclear history. The BORAX Experiments were a series of destructive tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX 1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed to demonstrate that the reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. After leaving the Argonne National Laboratory in 1956, Zinn moved to Florida, where he founded his own consulting firm, General Nuclear Engineering, with its headquarters in Dunedin, Florida. The company was involved in the design and construction of pressurized water reactors. It was acquired by Combustion Engineering in 1964, and he became a vice president and head of its nuclear division. He stepped down from this position in 1970, but remained a board member until 1986. He served as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1962, and a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC and its successor, the Energy Research and Development Administration, from 1972 to 1975. Over the years Zinn received multiple awards for his work, including a special commendation from the AEC in 1956, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1960, the Enrico Fermi Award in 1969, and the Elliott Cresson Medal from The Franklin Institute in 1970. In 1955 he was elected as the first president of the American Nuclear Society ANS . Zinn's wife Jean died in 1964. He married Mary Teresa Pratt in 1966, and thereby acquired two stepsons, Warren and Robert Johnson. He died in Mease Countryside Hospital in Safety Harbor, Florida, on February 14, 2000, after suffering a stroke. He was survived by his wife Mary, sons John and Robert and stepson Warren. Robert had become a professor of astronomy at Yale University. Since 1976, the American Nuclear Society's Operations and Power Division, has annually presented the Walter H. Zinn Award to recognize an individual for a notable and sustained contribution to the nuclear power industry that has not been widely recognized.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter%20Zinn
"Zion Square Hebrew , Kikar Tziyon is a public square in Jerusalem, Israel, located at the intersection of Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street, Herbert Samuel Street, and Yoel Moshe Salomon Street. The square is one of the vertices of the Downtown Triangle commercial district. Since the British Mandate era, Zion Square has been the focal point of the cultural life of downtown Jerusalem. The square is busy day and night with tourists, elderly immigrants, overseas students, local youth, street performers, and religious activists. In recent decades, the square has become a hangout for disaffected and homeless youth. From the 1930s to 2011, the square was a popular site for mass protests and demonstrations. The square, originally called Zion Circus, was named for the Zion Cinema also called Zion Hall , a 400 seat silent movie house which occupied a hut on the site from 1912 to 1920. After the hut collapsed under a heavy snowfall, the cinema was reconstructed as a 600 seat theater for film screenings and live opera performances. The land on which Zion Square and the Downtown Triangle lies was purchased by the Jewish Colonization Association from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which began selling off some of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I. Mandate officials developed the field into a triangular district bordered by Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street constructed by the British in 1922 and King George Street constructed by the British in 1924 . Zion Square was also designed by the British as a roundabout. The popularity of the films, operas, plays, concerts and lectures presented at the Zion Cinema turned Zion Square into the center of cultural life in Jerusalem in the 1920s and 1930s. Movie and theater goers gravitated between the cinema and the many cafes and coffee houses in the Downtown Triangle two of the popular cafes were located in Zion Square itself the Vienna Cafe and the Europa Cafe. Zion Square became a rallying point for political demonstrations and social protests beginning in the 1930s, when young Zionists held rallies here. From the 1950s to the 2000s, primarily right wing demonstrations were staged here. Several demonstrations turned violent, such as a 1971 protest by the Israeli Black Panthers in which Prime Minister Golda Meir was burned in effigy, and a 1995 protest against Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the signing of the Taba Agreement Oslo II , after which thousands of protesters continued on to the Knesset, destroying property en route. The largest demonstrations in the square included a May 2000 protest decrying the handover of Arab settlements adjacent to the Mount of Olives, a November 2000 protest against Ehud Barak's policy of restraint at the beginning of the Second Intifada, and a 2006 protest against the policies of acting prime minister Ehud Olmert, each of which drew around an estimated 100,000 people. With the opening of the Jerusalem Light Rail on Jaffa Road in August 2011, Jerusalem police stopped issuing permits for demonstrations in Zion Square to avoid the disruption of light rail operations. The Zion Cinema was the site of two attempted bombings, one in 1951 and the other in 1967. In both cases, an incendiary device was planted under the theater seats and was discovered before it detonated. On July 4, 1975, a refrigerator loaded with 5 kilograms 11 lb of explosives detonated in Zion Square, killing 15 and wounding 77. At the time, the attack was the deadliest ever against Israeli citizens by a booby trapped bomb. On March 24, 1979, a bomb exploded in a garbage can in Zion Square, killing one and wounding 13. On the night of August 1617, 2012, dozens of Jewish teens chased four Palestinian teens in Zion Square and beat one of them unconscious, in what Israeli police and witnesses described as an attempted lynching. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, the city embarked on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers away from the city center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel on the upper floors and a branch of Bank Hapoalim on the lower floors was erected. In 1983 Zion Square was converted into a pedestrian promenade along with Ben Yehuda Street and other streets in the Downtown Triangle in a successful effort to revitalize the downtown district. In 2006 the Jerusalem Foundation floated a secret proposal to rename the square Rapaport Plaza, after a Waco, Texas philanthropist who pledged 2 million toward the square's renovation. Architect Ron Arad of London was hired and presented a plan to install a towering, red, reflective steel sculpture as a focal point for the square. The plan, which was not reported to the public, was spotted on the Jerusalem Foundation website and brought to public attention by Lemallah, a grassroots citizens watch group, which launched a successful public protest against the name change and the sculpture. At the same time, Lemallah produced its own counterproposal for a round, six sided, steel peace dome to span the square and Jaffa Road. That idea, too, did not come to fruition. In early 2016, a contest was held to redesign the square and on September 13, 2016, the Jerusalem Municipality announced that its panel had chosen a design by Maya Atidia and Tamir Manzur Carmel called Urban Forest Clearing as the winner. Redevelopment work began in 2018, with the installation of a stage, public seating, and trees of the plane, carob, Mediterranean hackberry, and pear varieties. Go Jerusalem.com Zion Square is busy day and night as a meeting place and hangout for people from all walks of life, including tourists, elderly immigrants, seminary students, street performers, and Chabad and Breslov activists. Zion Square has been described as always crowded, always crazy . The square is a hangout for drug users. An estimated 70 percent of teenagers who hang out in the square take drugs. The open, street level basement of the Kikar Zion Hotel is a well known haunt for both drug dealers and prostitutes. School dropouts, disaffected religious immigrant teens, and homeless youth are also fixtures in the square. Street workers have identified large groups of Russian immigrant youth hanging out in the square and drinking vodka purchased with money panhandled off tourists. The square also attracts sizable numbers of settlement youth uprooted by the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza. To reach out to at risk and disaffected square dwellers , several drop in centers operate in the vicinity of Zion Square, including Crossroads, Hameshulash, Hezroni's Squat, and The Zone. The ELEM Youth Distress in Israel organization brings a mobile unit to Zion Square on weeknights to engage street youth in art projects. Zion Cinema was the central landmark of Zion Square from the 1920s until its closure in 1972. Located on the south side of Zion Square, it was originally a 400 seat silent movie hut and, after snowfall destroyed the structure, was rebuilt into a 600 seat theatre that staged plays, concerts, lectures, and films. In the 1920s and 1930s the Zion Cinema was the cultural center of Jerusalem. After its closure, the building was demolished and a high rise containing the Kikar Zion Hotel and a branch of Bank HaPoalim was erected in its place. In 2013 the 117 room hotel was purchased by Orchid Hotel Management Ltd., which is renovating the property for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. The hotel will have 137 rooms and suites, and a kosher rooftop restaurant with a 360 degree panoramic view. Hamashbir Lazarchan, a seven story, 5,000 square metres 54,000 sq ft department store that opened on the east side of Zion Square in 2011, is the largest department store in Israel and the flagship store of the 38 store chain. The store was originally established in 1947 on the opposite side of Jaffa Road, and moved to a location near King George and Ben Yehuda Streets from 1970 to 2010. On the north side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel. Menachem Begin stood on one of the hotel's balconies on August 3, 1948, to announce the dissolution of the Irgun and the sign up of his soldiers with the Israel Defense Forces. On the west side of Zion Square stands the Sansur Building, erected in 1929. This three story office and commercial building sports an eclectic , neo Renaissance and classical design. The building was commissioned by and named for a Christian Arab merchant from Bethlehem and originally housed Cafe Europe, a popular coffeehouse patronized by Jews, Arabs, and British in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1947 48 it housed the Jerusalem Emergency Committee.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion%20Square
"Zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon the word is related to Persian zargun zircon zar gun, gold like or as gold , the most important source of zirconium. It is a lustrous, grey white, strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable. Zirconium compounds have no known biological role. Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish white, soft, ductile, malleable metal that is solid at room temperature, though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35 K. The melting point of zirconium is 1855 C 3371 F , and the boiling point is 4371 C 7900 F . Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium. At room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close packed crystal structure, Zr, which changes to Zr, a body centered cubic crystal structure, at 863 C. Zirconium exists in the phase until the melting point. Naturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr and 94Zr are stable, although 94Zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay not observed experimentally with a half life of more than 1.101017 years. 96Zr has a half life of 2.41019 years, and is the longest lived radioisotope of zirconium. Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45 of all zirconium. 96Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80 of zirconium. Twenty eight artificial isotopes of zirconium have been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110. 93Zr is the longest lived artificial isotope, with a half life of 1.53106 years. 110Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, is the most radioactive, with an estimated half life of 30 milliseconds. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The only exception is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture. Five isotopes of zirconium also exist as metastable isomers 83mZr, 85mZr, 89mZr, 90m1Zr, 90m2Zr and 91mZr. Of these, 90m2Zr has the shortest half life at 131 nanoseconds. 89mZr is the longest lived with a half life of 4.161 minutes. Zirconium has a concentration of about 130 mg kg within the Earth's crust and about 0.026 g L in sea water. It is not found in nature as a native metal, reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water. The principal commercial source of zirconium is zircon ZrSiO4 , a silicate mineral, which is found primarily in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and the United States, as well as in smaller deposits around the world. As of 2013, two thirds of zircon mining occurs in Australia and South Africa. Zircon resources exceed 60 million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately 900,000 tonnes. Zirconium also occurs in more than 140 other minerals, including the commercially useful ores baddeleyite and kosnarite. Zirconium is relatively abundant in S type stars, and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo missions to the moon have a high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks. Zirconium is a by product of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from 360 to 840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from 39,900 to 22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive. Collected from coastal waters, zircon bearing sand is purified by spiral concentrators to remove lighter materials, which are then returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed. Most zircon is used directly in commercial applications, but a small percentage is converted to the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by the reduction of the zirconium IV chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking. Commercial zirconium metal typically contains 13 of hafnium, which is usually not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. Their neutron absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. Several separation schemes are in use. The liquid liquid extraction of the thiocyanate oxide derivatives exploits the fact that the hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water. This method is used mainly in United States. Zr and Hf can also be separated by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate K2ZrF6 , which is less soluble in water than the analogous hafnium derivative. Fractional distillation of the tetrachlorides, also called extractive distillation, is used primarily in Europe. The product of a quadruple VAM vacuum arc melting process, combined with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high pressure, high temperature gas autoclaving. This produces reactor grade zirconium that is about 10 times more expensive than the hafnium contaminated commercial grade. Hafnium must be removed from zirconium for nuclear applications because hafnium has a neutron absorption cross section 600 times greater than zirconium. The separated hafnium can be used for reactor control rods. Like other transition metals, zirconium forms a wide range of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein zirconium has the oxidation state 4. Far fewer Zr III compounds are known, and Zr II is very rare. The most common oxide is zirconium dioxide, ZrO2, also known as zirconia. This clear to white coloured solid has exceptional fracture toughness and chemical resistance, especially in its cubic form. These properties make zirconia useful as a thermal barrier coating, although it is also a common diamond substitute. Zirconium monoxide, ZrO, is also known and S type stars are recognised by detection of its emission lines in the visual spectrum. Zirconium tungstate has the unusual property of shrinking in all dimensions when heated, whereas most other substances expand when heated. Zirconyl chloride is a rare water soluble zirconium complex with the relatively complicated formula Zr4 OH 12 H2O 16 Cl8. Zirconium carbide and zirconium nitride are refractory solids. The carbide is used for drilling tools and cutting edges. Zirconium hydride phases are also known. Lead zirconate titanate PZT is the most commonly used piezoelectric material, with applications such as ultrasonic transducers, hydrophones, common rail injectors, piezoelectric transformers and micro actuators. All four common halides are known, ZrF4, ZrCl4, ZrBr4, and ZrI4. All have polymeric structures and are far less volatile than the corresponding monomeric titanium tetrahalides. All tend to hydrolyse to give the so called oxyhalides and dioxides. The corresponding tetraalkoxides are also known. Unlike the halides, the alkoxides dissolve in nonpolar solvents. Dihydrogen hexafluorozirconate is used in the metal finishing industry as an etching agent to promote paint adhesion. Organozirconium chemistry is the study of compounds containing a carbon zirconium bond. The first such compound was zirconocene dibromide C5H5 2ZrBr2 , reported in 1952 by Birmingham and Wilkinson. Schwartz's reagent, prepared in 1970 by P. C. Wailes and H. Weigold, is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes. Zirconium is also a component of some ZieglerNatta catalysts, used to produce polypropylene. This application exploits the ability of zirconium to reversibly form bonds to carbon. Most complexes of Zr II are derivatives of zirconocene, one example being C5Me5 2Zr CO 2. The zirconium containing mineral zircon and related minerals jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral was not known to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon now Sri Lanka . He named the new element Zirkonerde zirconia . Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube. The crystal bar process also known as the Iodide Process , discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925, was the first industrial process for the commercial production of metallic zirconium. It involves the formation and subsequent thermal decomposition of zirconium tetraiodide, and was superseded in 1945 by the much cheaper Kroll process developed by William Justin Kroll, in which zirconium tetrachloride is reduced by magnesium Approximately 900,000 tonnes of zirconium ores were mined in 1995, mostly as zircon. Most zircon is used directly in high temperature applications. This material is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack. Because of these properties, zircon finds many applications, few of which are highly publicized. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals. Zirconium dioxide ZrO2 is used in laboratory crucibles, in metallurgical furnaces, and as a refractory material. Because it is mechanically strong and flexible, it can be sintered into ceramic knives and other blades. Zircon ZrSiO4 and the cubic zirconia ZrO2 are cut into gemstones for use in jewelry. Zirconia is a component in some abrasives, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper. A small fraction of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is probably the purpose of including Zr nanoparticles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU 97 B Combined Effects Bomb. Burning zirconium was used as a light source in some photographic flashbulbs. Zirconium powder with a mesh size from 10 to 80 is occasionally used in pyrotechnic compositions to generate sparks. The high reactivity of zirconium leads to bright white sparks. Cladding for nuclear reactor fuels consumes about 1 of the zirconium supply, mainly in the form of zircaloys. The desired properties of these alloys are a low neutron capture cross section and resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions. Efficient methods for removing the hafnium impurities were developed to serve this purpose. One disadvantage of zirconium alloys is that zirconium reacts with water at high temperatures, producing hydrogen gas and accelerated degradation of the fuel rod cladding This exothermic reaction is very slow below 100 C, but at temperature above 900 C the reaction is rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant Japan after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011, leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations and at least one of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor PWR containment buildings, a catalyst based recombiner is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises. Materials fabricated from zirconium metal and ZrO2 are used in space vehicles where resistance to heat is needed. High temperature parts such as combustors, blades, and vanes in jet engines and stationary gas turbines are increasingly being protected by thin ceramic layers, usually composed of a mixture of zirconia and yttria. The isotope 89Zr has been applied to the tracking and quantification of molecular antibodies with positron emission tomography PET cameras a method called immuno PET . Immuno PET has reached a maturity of technical development and is now entering the phase of wide scale clinical applications. Until recently, radiolabeling with 89Zr was a complicated procedure requiring multiple steps. In 20012003 an improved multistep procedure was developed using a succinylated derivative of desferrioxamine B N sucDf as a bifunctional chelate, and a better way of binding 89Zr to mAbs was reported in 2009. The new method is fast, consists of only two steps, and uses two widely available ingredients 89Zr and the appropriate chelate. On going developments also include the use of siderophore derivatives to bind 89Zr IV . Zirconium bearing compounds are used in many biomedical applications, including dental implants and crowns, knee and hip replacements, middle ear ossicular chain reconstruction, and other restorative and prosthetic devices. Zirconium binds urea, a property that has been utilized extensively to the benefit of patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA . Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent based technologies. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is under investigation for oral therapy in the treatment of hyperkalemia. It is a highly selective oral sorbent designed specifically to trap potassium ions in preference to other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract. A mixture of monomeric and polymeric Zr4 and Al3 complexes with hydroxide, chloride and glycine, called Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly or AZG, is used in a preparation as an antiperspirant in many deodorant products. It is selected for its ability to obstruct pores in the skin and prevent sweat from leaving the body. Zirconium carbonate 3ZrO2CO2H2O was used in lotions to treat poison ivy but was discontinued because it occasionally caused skin reactions. Although zirconium has no known biological role, the human body contains, on average, 250 milligrams of zirconium, and daily intake is approximately 4.15 milligrams 3.5 milligrams from food and 0.65 milligrams from water , depending on dietary habits. Zirconium is widely distributed in nature and is found in all biological systems, for example 2.86 g g in whole wheat, 3.09 g g in brown rice, 0.55 g g in spinach, 1.23 g g in eggs, and 0.86 g g in ground beef. Further, zirconium is commonly used in commercial products e.g. deodorant sticks, aerosol antiperspirants and also in water purification e.g. control of phosphorus pollution, bacteria and pyrogen contaminated water . Short term exposure to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. Persistent exposure to zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, in a study of 20 rats given a standard diet containing 4 zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA legal limit permissible exposure limit for zirconium exposure is 5 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH recommended exposure limit REL is 5 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday and a short term limit of 10 mg m3. At levels of 25 mg m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause and effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic. Among the numerous radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr is among the most common. It is released as a product of 235U, mainly in nuclear plants and during nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a very long half life 1.53 million years , its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered as highly hazardous.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirconium
"Zirmunai Zirmunai pronounced listen is the most populous administrative division elderate in Vilnius. It is also a neighbourhood in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius, encompassing the city district of the same name, built in the 1960s. Zirmunai's history has been traced to the late 14th century, when a Lithuanian fishing village was founded across the River Neris from Vilnius' Old Town. Several historic sites in Zirmunai are internationally significant it is the home of Lithuania's largest Jewish cemetery, as well as the location of mass graves of soldiers belonging to Napoleon's Grande Armee and victims of the NKGB's and MGB's executions after World War II. Tuskulenai Manor, built in 1825, and the surrounding Peace Park are important historical and cultural attractions in Vilnius. The area was given the name Zirmunai during the early 1960s, when it became the site of an award winning residential construction project it was the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at the time. The massive Palace of Concerts and Sports and Zalgiris Stadium are other relics of Zirmunai's Soviet history. Zirmunai was important to the industrial sector in the USSR since that time, this function has been replaced or supplanted by newer businesses, including some of Lithuania's leading companies. Zirmunai has undergone major renovation and development in the 21st century. Siaures miestelis North Town is an area of Zirmunai that has rapidly evolved into one of the key business and residential districts of the city. This quarter was used by a number of regimes as a military garrison, and internationally significant historical findings have been made in the area. The Zirmunai elderate occupies 5.7 km2 or 1.4 of the total area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Zirmunai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4 kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5 kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Zirmunai elderate is only some 450 metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in the centre of the city. Zirmunai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Snipiskes in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Zirmunai's western boundary is defined by the following streets from north to south Verkiu, Zvalgu, Kalvariju, Zalgirio, and Rinktines. The River Neris serves as Zirmunai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Zirmunu Street is the district's main artery. Despite the proximity of the city centre, the Zirmunai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Zirmunai Bridge and continues upstream northeasterly . The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Zirmunai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park. The Zirmunai bank of the River Neris, from a point near Zirmunai Bridge and continuing downstream, was stabilised during the 1980s with a steeply sloped concrete net like structure which includes patches of grass between the webbing of the net the lower part of the fortification is a concrete tiled walkway, ending just over 4 kilometres downstream, beyond Liubartas Bridge in Zverynas. The walkway is used extensively by walkers, joggers, and cyclists, as well as providing seating for anglers. Construction vehicles sometimes use it to reach work areas. The walkway is submerged during the river floods, mostly in springtime. As of the census taken in April 2001, the ethnic makeup of Zirmunai was 59.2 Lithuanian, 16.8 Russian the third highest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, behind Naujoji Vilnia and Naujininkai , 14.4 Poles, 3.8 Belarusian, 1.7 Ukrainian, 0.8 Jewish, 0.2 Tatar, 0.1 Latvian, 0.1 Armenian, and 2.9 other or unspecified ethnicity. According to the 2001 census, Zirmunai was the most populous elderate in Vilnius 47,410 residents, comprising 8.7 of Vilnius' total population and the third most populous in Lithuania after Silainiai and Dainava, Kaunas. The population density was 8,317.5 km2. According to the census, there were 21,363 private households in the Zirmunai elderate, making for an average household size of about 2.2 persons. The population of Zirmunai has been rapidly increasing, largely due to construction of residential buildings in the Siaures miestelis section of the elderate. A former elder of Zirmunai estimated its 2002 population to be about 60,000 residents an increase of about 13,000 over the 2001 census figure. This rapid growth has placed a strain on city services. Zirmunai is occasionally described as a borough of elderly people or even a borough of elderly women . There is a certain statistical basis to the claim according to the data of the April 2001 census, only about 43.5 of Zirmunai's population were male, the second lowest percentage in Vilnius, after Zverynas 43.1 27.4 of the population 33.2 of women and 19.9 of men were of legal retirement age, which was 57.5 years for women and 61.5 years for men at the time. This is the highest percentage in Vilnius accordingly, Zirmunai had the lowest percentage of residents that were statistically of working age defined as over age 15 and up to the retirement age in Vilnius, only 56.4 in total 52.8 of women and 61.1 of men. The heavy proportion of elderly persons in the district may be attributed to the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females , according to the World Health Organization. At the time of the 2001 census, persons aged between 0 and 15 years comprised 16.1 of Zirmunai's population, the second lowest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, slightly higher than Virsuliskes at 15.5 . However, it is likely that the average age of Zirmunai's residents has decreased since the last census, and will continue to decrease, as a result of the active construction of new dwellings, which are acquired primarily by younger people. As housing prices rise, retirees are motivated to sell their apartments with the goal of acquiring cheaper housing elsewhere with funds to spare. In 2005, 2,317 crimes were registered in the Zirmunai elderate. This is the third highest figure among Vilnius' elderates, behind the Old Town and Naujamiestis. Using the population data of the latest available census 2001 , this would amount to about 48.9 crimes per 1,000 residents per year only the eighth highest figure, due to the elderate's large population Vilnius' total crime rate, using the same population data, would be about 51 crimes per 1,000 residents . In terms of crime density, 406.5 crimes per 1 square kilometre were registered the fourth highest figure, behind the Old Town, Naujamiestis and Snipiskes Vilnius' total crime density, using the same population data, would be about 70.4 . However, thanks largely to the crime prevention programme Saugus miestas Safe City , crime rates in Zirmunai, as in all other elderates of Vilnius, are declining. For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Zirmunai during the first four months of 2005, versus 672 during the same period of 2006, a decline of about 24 . If this trend continues, Zirmunai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents. The most frequently registered crimes during the first four months of 2006 were theft 335 instances, including 19 car thefts, constituting about 50 of the total number of crimes rape 259 instances or about 38.5 of the total robbery 44 instances or about 6.5 and bodily injury 20 instances or about 3 . Percentage data may overlap as one criminal act may have several features, which are registered separately, but the total number of crimes is calculated per incident. The elderate of Zirmunai embraces three historical suburbs of Vilnius Zvejai, Tuskulenai and Siaures miestelis. Fishing village Zvejai dating to the 14th century included the only glass factory in the 16th century Lithuania, as well as the largest Jewish cemetery. It became an integral part of Vilnius in the 16th century. The area south of Zvejai became known after the name of the Tusculanum Manor. Manor itself was a property of noble families and officials, and is the oldest building in Zirmunai. In the 19th century, a military garrison was established in the present day Siaures miestelis, which was used by Russian, French and Polish armies. These territories were consolidated into Vilnius city during the period of rapid growth that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. The Tuskulenai Manor was used as the KGB officers' apartments back then. In the last years, a housing renovation program was launched in Zirmunai. Military structures in Siaures miestelis of a historical value have been preserved and restored. Siaures miestelis became one of the most soughtafter residential and commercial areas of Vilnius. Zirmunai's southernmost section, which lies on the bank of the River Neris opposite the Vilnius Castle Complex, was part of the settlement known as Zvejai another part of that settlement is now located within the elderate of Snipiskes. According to archaeological surveys from 2005, a fishing village may have been located here as early as the late 14th century, giving the area its name, literally, Fishermen it was later settled by craftsmen and housed the Orthodox Church of St Barbara. During the 16th century, the only glass factory in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was located in the suburb of Zvejai. In 1563, after the construction of the first bridge over the River Neris at the approximate location of today's Mindaugas Bridge , the suburb of Zvejai became an integral part of the city of Vilnius. During Tsarist rule in the 19th century, the name of Zvejai was superseded by that of Piramont, originating from the small estate of Piramont in the area now Kalvariju 1 . Piramontskij Alley can be seen in a 1904 map of Vilnius where today's A. Juozapaviciaus Street in the elderate of Snipiskes is located, close to the boundary of Zirmunai. The usage of Piramont as a placename gradually became limited to the southern part of Zvejai. The heritage of Zvejai was retained in the name of Zveju Fishermen's Street, which runs alongside the River Neris in southern Snipiskes and Zirmunai. However, the Zirmunai section of this street was renamed Olimpieciu Olympians in 2000 to commemorate the achievements of Lithuanian Olympic athletes in the Sydney Olympics. The largest and oldest Jewish cemetery in Lithuania, first mentioned in 1592, was also located in Zvejai. It was known in the local Jewish community as Shnipishok. The Yiddish placename later became associated with the whole borough of Snipiskes, now bordering Zirmunai on the west. Although the cemetery was officially closed in 1830 and was subject to gradual deterioration, there were further interments. Vilna Gaon, as well as other famous Vilnian Jews, were interred in the cemetery. During the years of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the area on the right bank of the River Neris opposite the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Antakalnis, a Royal Manor called Derevnictva Polish Derewnictwo , was established in the mid 16th century by King Sigismund Augustus as an outpost of the Vilnius Castles. The manor was held by the kings Sigismund III Vasa and Wadysaw IV Vasa, nobleman M. Piegowski, the Woowicz family, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Micha Kazimierz Pac, as well by the Tyzenhaus family after 1741. In the mid 18th century, Lateran monks acquired the manor and named it Tusculanum, after the resort outside the ancient Roman city of Tusculum. see also Villa Rufinella The surrounding forests were used as a game reserve and for sport fishing. Towards the end of the century, the manor was separated into the folwarks of Tuskulenai, based on the core of the old royal manor, and Derevnictva. Under the rule of the Russian Empire in the 19th century, the Tuskulenai Manor was held by various noble families and high ranking state officials, including Governor General of LithuanianVilna Governorate, Alexander Rimsky Korsakov. In the mid 19th century the main palace was transformed into a guesthouse that became a cultural center in Vilnius, often visited by Stanislaw Moniuszko and Jozef Ignacy Kraszewski. The manor passed into the possession of Julija Safranovich after 1886, and then was held by Olga Melentjeva and her noble family until World War II. The area surrounding Tuskulenai Manor was referred to as Tuskulenai Russian Tuskuljany Polish Tuskulanum until World War II. This area was also known as Losiovka or Losiuvka, colloquially named after A. Losev, colonel of Special Corps of Gendarmes and later general of the Russian Empire, who owned the folwark of Tuskulenai in 1869. The placenames are associated primarily with individual wooden houses, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some of which are still scattered among the apartment buildings. A military garrison was built in the approximate location of the modern Siaures miestelis North Town , that is, north of Old Vilnius section of Zirmunai by the Russian Empire during the 19th century. This area went on to be used as a garrison by a number of armies Napoleon's Grande Armee in 1812, Tsarist for the rest of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century see the 27th infantry division's camp in the map of 1904 , the Bolsheviks during World War I, the Polish army in the inter war period, and the Red Army from the 1950s to 1992. During the interwar period, when Vilnius was under Polish control, the southern part of Zvejai was known as Pioromont the entire Zvejai area was referred to as Rybaki Polish for Fishermen modern Siaures miestelis had been called Plac broni Polish for the Military training ground and the old placename of Derewnictwo, dating back to the times of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, applied to the area north of Tuskulenai Manor. A map of Vilnius published in 1942, while the city was under Nazi rule, shows the northern part of Zirmunai as Paneriskes, the middle section as Kareiviskes place of soldiers and the southern part, close to the Tuskulenai Manor, as Mantiskes a place named in honour of Mantas . One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas Herkus Monte , a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Snipiskes elderate ending at the boundary of Zirmunai. A Soviet military base was established in the current Siaures miestelis section of Zirmunai during the 1950s. The heavily wooded northernmost part of the elderate was thinly populated until the 1960s. During the 1960s, Zirmunai attracted the attention of urban planners it became the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at that time. Designed in 1962, the district consisted of three microdistricts residential and industrial sections centred around public facilities and had been the largest residential area in the city. The first microdistrict, or Zirmunai I , which is district's middle section, was built in 196267 in accordance with a project by architect Birute Kasperaviciene, who was avarded the USSR State Prize in 1968, together with architect Bronislovas Kruminis and engineers Smuelis Liubeckis and Vaclovas Zubras it was the first time this award had been presented to the designers of a large scale residential construction. The second microdistrict, Zirmunai II , which is the southernmost of the three, was built in 196468, its architect being Nijole Chlomauskiene. And the third, the northernmost microdistrict, Zirmunai III designed by architect Laima Burneikiene was built in 196469 in the site of the former village of Paneriskes. The city district was then named after the formerly Lithuanian village of Zirmunai Russian Zhirmuny , now situated 16 kilometres from the LithuaniaBelarus border in the Voranauski District, Hrodna Province of Belarus. This village is where Karol Podczaszynski, an architect and designer of Tuskulenai Manor, was born. Hence the future district's major street Zirmunu was named after the village as it is seen in the map of 1942 and gave its name to the entire district. The new residential housing in the microdistrict consisted almost exclusively of five story prefabricated concrete block apartment buildings popularly known as khrushchyovkas. Three nine story high rise apartment buildings were built in 1969, and several more were constructed later, as well as seven brick built twelve storeys. The apartment buildings were meant primarily to accommodate industrial workers who came to Vilnius from other regions of the Lithuanian SSR and from other Soviet Republics. They typify the Brutalist architecture of the era. The principles governing the design of the microdistrict were set forth in books by the University of Moscow planners, for instance in New Element of Populating. En Route to the New City published in the USSR in 1966 although the concept of the new element has been dated to 1959 the book was later published as The Ideal Communist City in the United States, United Kingdom and Italy. According to the book, the optimal apartment size was about 600 square feet 56 square metres , with one bathroom and two bedrooms. Single family homes were considered too autonomous . The ancient Jewish cemetery in Zvejai stood in the way of the expansion. Many tombstones were destroyed in 1950 during the construction of Zalgiris Stadium the cemetery was completely demolished in 1955 in accordance with a decree issued by local authorities in 1948. The bodies of Vilna Gaon and several members of his immediate family were relocated, after receiving special permission from the Soviet authorities this relocation has been the subject of historical controversy. The cemetery was the subject of an archaeological survey in the late 1990s. A memorial stone was placed in the southeastern portion of the former cemetery with an inscription in Yiddish and Lithuanian, stating that the cemetery was established there in 1478 this dating is disputed . An incident in Zirmunai's history that has been difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re erected at the site the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need. Tuskulenai Manor had been nationalised in 1940 and was later used as KGB officers' apartments and as a kindergarten. During excavations that took place between 1994 and 1996 in its territory, the remains of 706 bodies were found 40 were identified. The area had been used to hide the bodies of Lithuanian residents mostly resistance fighters against the Soviet occupation and Nazi collaborators who had been executed by the NKGB and MGB in the Vilnius' KGB Palace between 1944 and 1947 but also those who died fighting Polish Armia Krajowa soldiers. The remains from the mass grave were placed in a columbarium built underground, beneath an artificial hill, and consecrated in 2004. In 2001, workers laying telephone line in Siaures miestelis, near the former garrison, discovered a mass grave that was found to contain the bodies of about 2,000 soldiers the remnants of Napoleon's Grande Armee as it retreated from Moscow. In December 1812, temperatures in Vilnius had sunk to 30C, and the frozen ground made proper burials impossible. The Grande Armee at that time comprised French, Portuguese, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, and Croats, as well as Lithuanians and Poles. The bones have been intensively studied by forensic pathologists DNA evidence showed that many of the deaths were caused by typhus. Most of the remains were re interred in Antakalnis Cemetery. Other findings included buttons stamped with Napoleons image, crucifixes, wedding rings, belt buckles, boots and pieces of French uniforms. Footage from the location has been used in the TV series Moments in Time produced by Discovery Channel and Meet the Ancestors by BBC. The archaeological surveys were partially sponsored by the producers. The Red Army military base in Zirmunai was abandoned in 1992, a few years after Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union a grace period was granted in order to ensure the orderly resettlement of the soldiers and their families. Due to the Soviet principles of urban planning, Zirmunai, according to the 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates the other two being Karoliniskes and Virsuliskes with the lowest percentage of single family housing in the city 0.1 . Of the remaining residents, 0.4 owned a share of individual housing, 0.7 lived in hostels, and almost 99 lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means that the number of single family dwellings is not likely to increase a reverse process is taking place old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, there were only a few modern single family houses in Zirmunai. Zirmunai's housing, especially in its central sections, is in need of extensive renovation, due to wear and tear of its low or medium quality construction. A program to renew old apartment buildings including the installation of better insulation is ongoing in Vilnius, partially assisted by the Vilnius City Municipality the first finished renovation project a completely renewed 60 apartment building built in 1965 is located in Zirmunai. The area is, in some ways, analogous to public housing districts in Chicago and London although much of the housing was quickly and inexpensively erected in the 1960s, its proximity to downtown Vilnius, its transportation infrastructure, and its access to the River Neris account for its popularity. The principles of Soviet urban planning that led to its growth have converged with the modern concept of Smart growth . The Siaures miestelis section of Zirmunai is growing rapidly and in 2007 was one of Vilnius' most sought after residential and commercial areas. Many of the military structures that were built in the late 19th century in Siaures miestelis have been preserved and restored. Meanwhile, much of the construction that was not deemed to be of permanent value, erected during the Soviet times, has been demolished, leaving room for new streets and housing. The combination of military heritage sites and newer construction is a distinctive feature of Siaures miestelis. Reflecting its military history, numerous street names in and around Siaures miestelis allude to military concepts, including Kareiviu Soldiers , Lakunu Pilots , Zygio March , Apkasu Trenches , Ulonu Light Cavalry . The new streets built in Siaures miestelis during the beginning of the 21st century were named for prominent figures in Lithuanian military history Povilas Luksys, Lithuanian army volunteer, the first to perish in the Independence Wars in 1919 with the Bolshevik forces, as well as Kazys Ladyga, Silvestras Zukauskas, Jonas Galvydis Bikauskas, Vladas Nagevicius, and Jurgis Kubilius, prominent officers of the inter war Lithuanian Army, whose histories are not directly related to the area. On the contrary, these personalities distinguished themselves by opposing the Bolshevik and Polish armies that were historically garrisoned in Siaures miestelis. The naming was suggested by the Ministry of Defence. There are more streets not far from Siaures miestelis that bear military themed names Raitininku Cavalrymen , Zvalgu Scouts and Rinktines Platoon . An international dispute arose in the 2000s over construction near the Jewish cemetery, with organizations expressing concerns that gravesites could be disturbed. The educational institutions in Zirmunai include three secondary schools, all Lithuanian language. Tuskulenai Secondary School Lithuanian Tuskulenu vidurine mokykla, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 31 had 1,463 students in 2006, which made it the fifth largest school in Vilnius. The school features advanced classes in the visual arts. St. Christopher's Gymnasium Lithuanian Sv. Kristoforo gimnazija, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 9 was the eighth largest in Vilnius with 1,391 students in 2006. Zirmunai Gymnasium Lithuanian Zirmunu gimnazija, formerly Vilnius Secondary School No. 7 had 800 students in 2006. The school was granted the title Gymnasium in 2000 it is home to the acclaimed brass band Septima, established in 1966. There are three elementary schools located in Zirmunai Antoni Wiwulski, Emilia Plater, and St. Christopher. Sarunas Marciulionis Basketball School and Vilnius Sports School offer physical education. The Vilnius School of Radioelectronics and Precision Mechanics Lithuanian Vilniaus radioelektronikos ir tiksliosios mechanikos mokykla was established in 1965 to prepare workers for Vilma, a manufacturer of electrical products still operating in Zirmunai. The Vilnius School of Tourism and Commerce Lithuanian Vilniaus turizmo ir prekybos verslo mokykla offers certificates in retailing, basic bookkeeping, hotel and restaurant services, and other business areas. Vilnius Gija Youth School serves those students who have special needs and do not succeed in traditional classroom settings. Zirmunai also has one of the three Children's Foster Homes in Vilnius. As of the census taken in April 2001, 26.2 of Zirmunai's residents aged 10 or older possessed a bachelor's or higher degree. Tuskulenai Manor is Zirmunai's oldest extant architectural structure. The manor was built in 1825, following a design by Karol Podczaszynski in the neoclassical style. It consists of the principal building the palace , an officina storage house , and several adjacent buildings, including a small eclectic chapel of St. Theresa located about 100 metres south of the principal building. The Little White Manor , also known as the villa of Franciszek Walicki, was built in 1866 further south from the manor, acquired by Walicki in 1928, and reconstructed to serve as a summer residence. All of these structures have been restored by 2009, and are a part of the 7.5 hectare Peace Park Rimties parkas that includes the Tuskulenai Manor, hosting a museum of martyrology in Lithuania in the second half of the 20th century a branch of the Lithuanian Museum of Genocide Victims , restored landscaping, as well as the columbarium. A Museum of Computing was opened in 2001 in Zirmunai by the Lithuanian software company Sintagma, showcasing the history of Lithuanian computing science and hardware production. It was based on a museum opened in 1985 by Sigma, one of the leading computer manufacturers in the former Soviet Union. The museum's exhibits include EV 80, the first Soviet vacuum tube computing machine manufactured by Sigma, and a copy of the IBM 604. Three of the 19 brick chapels of the Vilnius Stations of the Cross Vilniaus Kalvarijos , part of Verkiai Regional Park, are located at the extreme northwestern corner of Zirmunai, just within the elderate's border. Once destroyed in 1963 and completely rebuilt, the three chapels, symbolizing the Mount of Olives and the Gardens of Gethsemane, are found only 20 meters away from the relatively busy Verkiu Street, and about a hundred meters downhill from a group of Soviet multi storey apartment buildings. The forested area along the banks of the River Neris in Zirmunai and its walkways are a popular recreational destination for many Vilnians. As a primarily residential area, Zirmunai hosted only 7.4 of Vilnius' public offices in 2003. Zirmunai is the location of the Personal Identity Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by Vilnius City Migration Service, which is housed in Zirmunai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Siaures Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Siaures Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Zirmunai. Several notable sports facilities are located in Zirmunai, including Zalgiris Stadium, Lithuania's largest stadium, and Impuls Plus fitness club. Rowing practices take place on the River Neris there is a base of operation, as well as several piers, on the Zirmunai bank of the river. One of Lithuania's largest indoor public swimming pools was situated in Zirmunai until the 1990s. Part of the annual international Vilnius Marathon course runs along the Zirmunai bank of the River Neris. The Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports Koncertu ir sporto rumai , built in 1971 in the southernmost part of Zirmunai in the middle of the former cemetery, is an example of Soviet Constructivism and Brutalist architecture , remarkable for its vessel like exterior. The Palace, once one of the architectonic icons of Soviet Vilnius, was, until the 1990s, a major venue for sporting events, especially local and international basketball matches, as well as concerts and shows. Its seating capacity is about 4,400. On 2223 October 1988 the building hosted the statutory meeting of Sajudis, the Lithuanian political organization that led the struggle for Lithuanian independence on 1415 January 1991, a public funeral for the victims of the January Events took place at the Palace. Later in the 1990s, the building was used as a temporary shopping mall where space was leased to small entrepreneurs for business exhibitions and fairs. In the 2000s developers announced plans to build multifunctional complexes, incorporating sports, business and residential structures, that would replace Zalgiris Stadium and the Palace of Concerts and Sports the projects have been stalled due to the inclusion of the Palace into the list Registry of Cultural Values in July 2006, and related litigation. The Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports an example of Soviet functionalism built in 1980 as the Palace of Culture and Sports of the Ministry of Interior , hosts several amateur art clubs choirs in particular , and is also used for indoor sports wrestling, martial arts, artistic gymnastics, volleyball, basketball , as well as lawn tennis, including two clay courts. Oskaras Korsunovas Theatre has occupied the former Lietuvos Rytas Arena which was the home of Lithuania's starring basketball team Lietuvos Rytas until the 2004 season, and was also used by the former women's basketball team BC Teo. Along with the Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports, it was used in 2006 as part of the set for 9 11 The Twin Towers, a docudrama about the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, a Dangerous Films production for BBC and Discovery Channel. Ukio banko teatro arena Ukio Bankas Theater Arena is now the venue of performances of Eimuntas Nekrosius of Meno Fortas and Anzelika Cholina Dance Theatre. Southern Zirmunai's sporting connections are reflected in the names of the streets along the Zirmunai side of the River Neris Sporto Sports and Olimpieciu Olympians . The Palace of Students' Technical Creative Work of the Republic is Lithuania's largest facility for high school students' after school activities of a technical nature, such as model building and go kart racing. The Grand Theater of Vilnius Didysis Vilniaus teatras is a small theater its misnomer is intentional that is formally based in Siaures miestelis it has no venue of its own and holds performances in other theaters. A building close to the western border of the Zirmunai elderate, an example of Socialist historicism built soon after the end of World War II, was the home of the Tevyne Motherland Cinema until the early 1990s it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004. It is unclear whether this building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values. 1,414 businesses, comprising 8.7 of all Vilnius' businesses, were headquartered in the Zirmunai elderate in 2003. Lithuania's largest electricity distribution network operator, Rytu skirstomieji tinklai, operates from Zirmunai, as well as TELE2, one of Lithuania's three mobile communications operators Ogmios, one of Lithuania's largest retailers and wholesalers of home appliances and Vilpra, Lithuania's largest dealer of heating equipment. In 1992, the former prominent Lithuanian basketball player Sarunas Marciulionis and his business partners opened the Sarunas Hotel in Zirmunai. The Banginis and Rimi Hypermarket, located in Siaures miestelis, are among Lithuania's largest shopping centers. Vilniaus duona The Bread of Vilnius , Lithuania's largest baking company, operates one of its bakeries in Zirmunai. An abundance of automotive service facilities and car dealerships are located in the elderate, including some of the Lithuania's largest Opel, SAAB, Chevrolet Zaibo ratas , and Nissan Raitas dealerships. The northern part of Zirmunai was an important part of the Lithuanian SSR's industrial sector during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The Kuro aparaturos gamykla Fuel Equipment Factory is now bankrupt Sigma, formerly one of the leading manufacturers of electronics and computer components in the Soviet Union, which contributed to the description of the Lithuanian SSR as The Soviet Silicon Valley , continues to operate at a minimum level and Vilma remains Lithuania's largest manufacturer of electrical products. Zirmunai is well served by Vilnius' bus and trolleybus transportation network. One of Vilnius' trolleybus hubs is located in the northernmost part of Zirmunai elderate, and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Zirmunai. Zirmunai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in the Soviet era for a much lower vehicle traffic. Zirmunai is linked to the elderate of Antakalnis by three bridges over the River Neris Valakampiai Bridge, the longest bridge in Vilnius, built in 1972 the Silas Bridge, built in 1999, and Zirmunai Bridge, built in 1965. The Mindaugas Bridge was built in 2003 to link Zirmunai with Vilnius' Old Town. Passenger ferry transport on the Neris was active until the 1990s, but is now limited to occasional chartered sightseeing tours from the Mindaugas Bridge to Valakampiai in summer. For some time in the first half of the 20th century, a narrow gauge railway traversed Zirmunai following the approximate course of the modern Minties Street it crossed over the River Neris on a bridge located near the modern Silas Bridge, as can be seen in the 1942 map of Vilnius.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDirm%C5%ABnai
"Zita of Bourbon Parma Zita Maria delle Grazie Adelgonda Micaela Raffaela Gabriella Giuseppina Antonia Luisa Agnese 9 May 1892 14 March 1989 was the wife of Charles, the last monarch of Austria Hungary. As such, she was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, in addition to other titles. Born as the seventeenth child of the dispossessed Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became heir presumptive to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the old emperor's death. After the end of World War I in 1918, the Habsburgs were deposed and the empire became four independent countries, Austria, Hungary, and the newly formed Czechoslovakia and State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Charles and Zita left for exile in Switzerland and were subsequently removed from Hungary by the Allies to Madeira, where Charles died in 1922. After her husband's death, Zita and her son Otto served as symbols of unity for the exiled dynasty. A devout Catholic, she raised a large family after being widowed at the age of 29, and never remarried. Princess Zita of Bourbon Parma was born at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. 1 The unusual name Zita was given to her after a popular Italian Saint who had lived in Tuscany in the 13th century. 16 She was the third daughter and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Lowenstein Wertheim Rosenberg. Zita's father had lost his throne as a result of the movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child. 1 He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young . 1 Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita's mother. 1 The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert's 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio and his castle in Schwarzau in lower Austria. 56 It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria, moving to Pianore in the winter and returning in the summer. 2 To move between them, they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings. 7 Zita and her siblings were raised to speak Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and English. 2 She recalled At the age of ten, Zita was sent to a boarding school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, where there was a strict regime of study and religious instruction. 3 She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Francesca to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. 19 Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Francesca personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. 78 Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. 20 Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years. 15 In the close vicinity of Schwarzau castle was the Villa Wartholz, residence of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Zita's maternal aunt. 3 She was the stepmother of Archduke Otto, who died in 1906, and the step grandmother of Archduke Charles of Austria Este, at that time second in line to the Austrian throne. The two daughters of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria were Zita's first cousins and Charles' half aunts. They had met as children but did not see one another for almost ten years, as each pursued their education. In 1909, his Dragoon regiment was stationed at Brandeis an der Elbe Brandys on the Elbe , from where he visited his aunt at Franzensbad. 5 It was during one of these visits that Charles and Zita became reacquainted. 5 Charles was under pressure to marry Franz Ferdinand, his uncle and first in line, had married morganatically, and his children were excluded from the throne and Zita had a suitably royal genealogy. 16 Zita later recalled Archduke Charles traveled to Villa Pianore and asked for Zita's hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. 8 Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries about the fate of the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. 8 Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great uncle, the 81 year old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. 19 Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade. At this time, Archduke Charles was in his twenties and did not expect to become emperor for some time, especially while Franz Ferdinand remained in good health. This changed on 28 June 1914 when the heir and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb nationalists. Charles and Zita received the news by telegram that day. She said of her husband, Though it was a beautiful day, I saw his face go white in the sun. 30 In the war that followed, Charles was promoted to General in the Austrian army, taking command of the 20th Corps for an offensive in Tyrol. 36 The war was personally difficult for Zita, as several of her brothers fought on opposing sides in the conflict Prince Felix and Prince Rene had joined the Austrian army, while Prince Sixtus and Prince Xavier lived in France before the war and enlisted in the Belgian army. 33 Also her country of birth, Italy, joined the war against Austria in 1915, and so rumours of the 'Italian' Zita began to be muttered. Even as late as 1917, The German ambassador in Vienna, Count Otto Wedel would write to Berlin saying The Empress is descended from an Italian princely house... People do not entirely trust the Italian and her brood of relatives. 36 At Franz Joseph's request, Zita and her children left their residence at Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schonbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. 39 Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia at the age of 86 on 21 November 1916. I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband, Zita later recounted, and, with tears in his eyes, making the sign of the cross on Charles's forehead. As he did so he said, 'May God bless Your Majesty.' It was the first time we had heard the Imperial title used to us. 41 Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the coronation there was a banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during a time of war. 55 At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden where Charles's military headquarters were located to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. 60 Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, 50 and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war wounded. 21 By the spring of 1917, the War was dragging on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person. 66 Sixtus arrived with conditions for talks which had been agreed with the French the restoration to France of Alsace Lorraine annexed by Germany after the Franco Prussian War in 1870 restoration of the independence of Belgium independence for the kingdom of Serbia and the handover of Constantinople to Russia. 61 Charles agreed, in principle, to the first three points and wrote a letter to Sixtus dated 25 March 1917 which sent the secret and unofficial message to the President of France that I will use all means and all my personal influence . 72 This attempt at dynastic diplomacy eventually foundered. Germany refused to negotiate over Alsace Lorraine, 73 and, seeing a Russian collapse on the horizon, was loath to give up the war. 78 Sixtus continued his efforts, even meeting Lloyd George in London about Italy's territorial demands on Austria in the Treaty of London of 1915, 76 but the Prime Minister could not persuade his generals that Britain should make peace with Austria. 78 Zita managed a personal achievement during this time by stopping the German plans to send airplanes to bomb the home of the King and Queen of Belgium on their name days. 74 In April 1918, after the German Russian Treaty of Brest Litovsk, Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin made a speech attacking incoming French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers. 9293 Clemenceau was incensed and, after seeing the Emperor Charles's letter of 24 March 1917, had it published. 95 For a while, the life of Sixtus appeared to be in danger, and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a 'Word of Honour' to Austria's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace. 99 Czernin had actually been in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair. After failing to do so, Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister. 102 By this time, the war was closing in on the embattled Emperor. A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state independent of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918, the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens, and, on 25 September 1918, her brother in law King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently. Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram of Bulgaria's collapse. She remembered it made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still something to talk about. 111 On 16 October, the emperor issued a People's Manifesto proposing the empire be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state. Instead, each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved. 113115 Leaving behind their children at Godollo, Charles and Zita travelled to the Schonbrunn Palace. By this time ministers had been appointed by the new state of German Austria , and by 11 November, together with the emperor's spokesmen, they prepared a manifesto for Charles to sign. 121130 Zita, at first glance, mistook it for an abdication and made her famous statement Charles gave his permission for the document to be published, and he, his family and the remnants of his Court departed for the Royal shooting lodge at Eckartsau, close to the borders with Hungary and Slovakia. 132 The Republic of German Austria was proclaimed the next day. After a difficult few months at Eckartsau, the Imperial Family received aid from an unexpected source. Prince Sixtus had met King George V and appealed to him to help the Habsburgs. George was reportedly moved by the request, it being only months since his imperial relatives in Russia had been executed by revolutionaries, and promised We will immediately do what is necessary. 137 Several British Army officers were sent to help Charles, most notably Lieutenant Colonel Edward Lisle Strutt, who was a grandson of Lord Belper and a former student at the University of Innsbruck. 139 On 19 March 1919, orders were received from the War Office to get the Emperor out of Austria without delay . With some difficulty, Strutt managed to arrange a train to Switzerland, enabling the Emperor to leave the country with dignity without having to abdicate. Charles, Zita, their children and their household left Eckartsau on 24 March escorted by a detachment of British soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company under the command of Strutt. 141146 The family's first home in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a property owned by the Bourbon Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border, compelled them to move to the western part of the country. The next month, therefore, found them moving to Villa Prangins, near Lake Geneva, where they resumed a quiet family life. 20 This abruptly ended in March 1920 when, after a period of instability in Hungary, Miklos Horthy was elected regent. Charles was still technically King as Charles IV but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed. 153156 After the Trianon Treaty Horthy's ambition soon grew. Charles became concerned and requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary. 153156 Charles twice attempted to regain control, once in March 1921 and again in October 1921. Both attempts failed, despite Zita's staunch support she insisted on travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest . 192 Charles and Zita temporarily resided at Castle Tata, the home of Count Esterhazy, 195 until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out given the possibility of Zita's brothers intriguing on Charles's behalf. 199 Eventually, the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS Glowworm was waiting. They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November. 200207 Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles's step grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis. 210211 The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922. Charles had been in poor health for some time. After going shopping on a chilly day in Funchal to buy toys for Carl Ludwig, he was struck by an attack of bronchitis. This rapidly worsened into pneumonia, not helped by the inadequate medical care available. Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita at the time eight months pregnant helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April, his last words to his wife being I love you so much. 214215 After his funeral, a witness said of Zita This woman really is to be admired. She did not, for one second, lose her composure... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral. They were all under her charm. 216 Zita wore mourning black in Charles's memory throughout sixty seven years of widowhood. 151 After Charles's death, the former Austrian imperial family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and they agreed to allow Zita and her seven soon to be eight children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita gave birth to Archduchess Elisabeth. 274 Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, who did not want to be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. 289 For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. 219220 They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials. 223224 By 1929, several of the children were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. 231 Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini's Italy. 233236 There was even a possibility of a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. 240265 As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists. 268269 With the Nazi invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita and her family became war refugees. They narrowly missed being killed by a direct hit on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier's French Castle in Bostz. 271272 The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border, reaching it on 18 May. They moved on to Portugal where the U.S. Government granted the family exit visas on 9 July. After a perilous journey they arrived in New York City on 27 July, having family in Long Island and Newark, New Jersey. 277 at one point, Zita and several of her children lived, as long term house guests, in Tuxedo Park, New York. The Austrian imperial refugees eventually settled in Quebec, which had the advantage of being French speaking the younger children were not yet fluent in English . 283 As they were cut off from all European funds, finances were more stretched than ever. At one stage, Zita was reduced to making salad and spinach dishes from dandelion leaves. 284 However, all her sons were active in the war effort. Otto promoted the dynasty's role in a post war Europe and met regularly with Franklin Roosevelt 270271 Robert was the Habsburg representative in London 285 Carl Ludwig and Felix joined the United States Army, serving with several American raised relatives of the Mauerer line 290 Rudolf smuggled himself into Austria in the final days of the war to help organise the resistance. 307 In 1945 Empress Zita celebrated her birthday on the first day of peace, 9 May. She was to spend the next two years touring the United States and Canada to raise funds for war ravaged Austria and Hungary. 157 After a period of rest and recovery, Zita found herself regularly going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided to move back to the continent full time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia died at the age of 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis at Zizers, Graubunden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita , she accepted with ease. 316 Zita occupied her final years with her family. Although the restrictions on the Habsburgs entering Austria had been lifted, this only applied to those born after 10 April 1919. This meant Zita could not attend the funeral of her daughter Adelheid in 1972, which was painful for her. 320 She also involved herself in the efforts to have her deceased husband, the Peace Emperor canonised. In 1982, the restrictions were eased, and she returned to Austria after having been absent for six decades. Over the next few years, the Empress made several visits to her former Austrian homeland, even appearing on Austrian television. 322323 In a series of interviews with the Viennese tabloid newspaper Kronen Zeitung, Zita expressed her belief that the deaths of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, at Mayerling, in 1889, were not a double suicide, but rather murder by French or Austrian agents. 320 After a memorable 90th birthday, where she was surrounded by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. 326 Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. 24 While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia and spent most of the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. He and the rest of the family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. 327328 She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages. Her funeral was held in Vienna on 1 April. The government allowed it to take place on Austrian soil providing that the cost was borne by the Habsburgs themselves. 329 Zita's body was carried to the Imperial Crypt under Capuchin Church in the same funeral coach she had walked behind during the funeral of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1916. It was attended by over 200 members of the Habsburg and Bourbon Parma families, and the service had 6,000 attendees including leading politicians, state officials and international representatives, including a representative of Pope John Paul II. 329 Following an ancient custom, the Empress had asked that her heart, which was placed in an urn, stay behind at Muri Abbey, in Switzerland, where the Emperor's heart had rested for decades. In doing so, Zita assured herself that, in death, she and her husband would remain by each other's side. 38 When the procession of mourners arrived at the gates of the Imperial Crypt, the herald who knocked on the door during this traditional admission ceremony introduced her as Zita, Her Majesty the Empress and Queen. On 10 December 2009, Mgr Yves Le Saux, Bishop of Le Mans, France, opened the diocesan process for the beatification of Zita. Zita was in the habit of spending several months each year in the diocese of Le Mans at St. Cecilia's Abbey, Solesmes, where three of her sisters were nuns. The actor is the French Association pour la Beatification de l'Imperatrice Zita. The postulator for the cause is Father Alexander Leonhardt. Vice postulator for Hungary is Catholic theologian Norbert Nagy. The judge of the tribunal is Father Bruno Bonnet. The promoter of justice is the Father Francois Scrive. With the opening of her cause, the late Empress has been accorded the title Servant of God. Asteroid 689 Zita is named in her honour. Charles and Zita had eight children and thirty three grandchildren Media related to Zita of Bourbon Parma at Wikimedia Commons",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zita%20of%20Bourbon-Parma

He posted double digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 158 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 20 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts.

His parents were a show business couple working for singer and pianist Nat King Cole and he had two sisters who were 9 and 13 years older than Barry. His family moved to San Diego, California, to help him concentrate on his baseball career, after he showed signs of promise from a very young age. His father, not knowing much about baseball, began reading books about pitching strategy and even stopped working to help coach his son. At the age of 12, Randy Jones, a former Cy Young Award winner, was hired by his father to give him lessons at 50 an hour. He transferred from El Cajon's Grossmont High School, where he was the star pitcher, to University of San Diego High School, a Roman Catholic private school for his senior year.

He led the Wareham Gatemen to the league championship in 1997, and a runner up finish in 1998. Zito was taken by the Seattle Mariners in the 59th round 1,586th overall of the 1996 Major League Baseball MLB draft, and in the third round 83rd overall by the Texas Rangers in 1998, but did not sign with either team. In the 1999 draft, he was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the ninth pick of the first round, and signed for a 1.59 million bonus. In 1999, Zito began his professional career with the Visalia Oaks, Oakland's A team. He went 30 with a 2.45 ERA in eight starts. He struck out 62 in 4013 innings.

During the month of September, he went 51 with a 1.73 ERA. Zito finished with a 74 record and a 2.72 earned run average in 14 starts. Despite his late start to the season, Zito still finished fifth in American League AL Rookie of the Year Award voting. Zito made his postseason debut in Game 4 of the AL Division Series ALDS against the New York Yankees. He went 5.2 innings, struck out 5, walked 2, and allowed an earned run. Zito earned the win, outpitching Roger Clemens. However, the Yankees would win the series, 32, and would go on to win their third straight World Series.

Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through the early part of the 2001 season, posting a 67 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 51 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 60 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 111 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball. The Athletics made the postseason and again played the Yankees in the ALDS. Zito pitched in Game 3 against Mike Mussina. He went eight innings, striking out six, walking one, and allowing an earned run. But Zito took the loss as the Yankees won the game, 10. The Yankees would end up taking the series, 32. In 2002, Zito became one of the best pitchers in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10 win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All Star team for the first time in his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher 14 . Zito would become the AL's first 15 game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him one more than his previous career high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers. On August 28, Zito earned his 19th win of the season against the Kansas City Royals. However, he lost his bid for a perfect game in the sixth inning when Neifi Perez singled with one out. Zito gave credit to Perez. I wasn't pitching to maintain a no hitter or something , Zito said. I left the ball up over the middle to Perez, and he hit it up the middle. It was a good piece of hitting. On September 8, Zito became the first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. I'm not pitching for the Cy Young , Zito said. I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series. In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, It would go to that young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but has won 21 games and he competes well. In his last start of the season, Zito went six innings and allowed just a run against the Texas Rangers. In his last 10 starts, Zito went 80, boosting his chances of winning the AL Cy Young Award. Barry pitched another gem , said Oakland manager Art Howe. He's certainly had a Cy Young type season. He's just been steady all season long. In Game 3 of the ALDS, Zito went six innings and gave up three earned runs against the Twins, earning the win. However, the Twins defeated the Athletics in five games, making the Athletics the first team to lose the deciding game of a series three years in a row. Zito would go on to win the AL Cy Young Award with a 235 record, narrowly defeating Pedro Martinez in the voting. He led the league with 23 wins, was second in winning percentage .821 , and third in both ERA 2.75 and strikeouts 182 . Zito's 23 wins were the most by an AL left hander since Frank Viola had 24 wins for Minnesota in 1988. Zito also allowed a .185 average to opposing hitters, the lowest in the AL. Martinez, who'd led the AL in ERA 2.26 , strikeouts 239 , and winning percentage .833 , became the first pitcher since the introduction of the award to lead his league in each of the three categories and not win the award. Zito became the first A's pitcher to win the Cy Young Award since Dennis Eckersley did it in 1992. Zito was also named AL TSN Pitcher of the Year. In 2003, Zito started off with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 straight games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 90 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he has that kind of command, you can see what happens. Zito struggled in his second to last start before the All Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny. Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team. In 2003, Zito was seventh in the AL in ERA 3.30 . He had a 1412 record and 146 strikeouts over a career high 231 23 innings pitched. In Game 2 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, Zito went seven innings, striking out nine, walking two, allowing one earned run, and earning the win in Oakland's 51 triumph. In Game 5, Zito went six innings and allowed four earned runs, taking the loss as the Red Sox won the game and the series. In 2004, Zito struggled and posted the worst numbers of his career at the time. Zito went 23 with a 6.83 ERA in the month of April. On May 28, facing Cliff Lee, he threw eight shutout innings but received a no decision in a 10 loss to the Cleveland Indians. He threw eight shutout innings of four hit ball in a 50 victory over the Devil Rays on August 21. Oakland manager Ken Macha would have let him throw a complete game, but Zito said, I was worrying about being fresh for the next game. I didn't want to end up 115120 , so I took advantage of the situation and shut it down. On September 12, he threw seven shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts, earning the win in a 10 victory over the Indians. For the season, he went 1111 with a 4.48 ERA. That was his only year with the Athletics that his ERA was more than 4.00. He still finished 10th in the league in strikeouts with 163. Following the departure of Tim Hudson and Mark Mulder, Zito was given his first Opening Day assignment in 2005. He allowed four runs over six innings in a 40 loss to the Orioles on April 4. In 2005, Zito again struggled in the month of April, going 04 with a 6.60 ERA. In his first 16 starts of the campaign, he was 38 with a 4.41 ERA. However, Zito pitched better the rest of the season. He had a streak of 14 consecutive starts from May 17 through July 25 and 20 out of 21 through August 30 in which he gave up fewer hits than innings pitched. From June 28 through August 4, he earned the win in eight consecutive starts. On June 6, Zito allowed two runs in six innings in a 21 loss to the Washington Nationals. During the game, he collected his first major league hit, against Tony Armas, Jr.. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in July, going 60 with a 2.51 ERA. In 35 starts, Zito went 1413 with a 3.86 ERA. Zito's 35 starts were the most in Major League Baseball that season, demonstrating his durability as a pitcher. He also had 171 strikeouts, good for fifth in the league. In 2006, Zito went 1.1 innings and allowed seven earned runs on Opening Day April 3 against the Yankees. It was the shortest outing of his career. However, Zito quickly rebounded from that bad start. On June 1, he allowed four hits over seven innings in a 40 victory over the Twins. During the game, he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout by punching out Lew Ford. On July 2, Zito and Brandon Webb both allowed one run through eight innings before Zito gave up two unearned runs while only getting two outs in the ninth Webb threw a complete game as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Athletics 31. When the All Star Break rolled around, Zito was 86 with a 3.29 earned run average. He was named to the 2006 All Star Game. On August 25, Zito earned his 100th career win when he defeated the Rangers 93. He had a no hitter going into the eighth inning, but Mark DeRosa singled to lead it off. In 35 starts first in the league again , he had a 1610 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 151 strikeouts. Zito was tied for eighth in the league in wins, he ranked tenth in ERA, and he was third in innings pitched 221 . He had the eighth lowest run support of AL pitchers 4.97 but had a 151 record if he received at least two runs of support. Zito helped the Athletics reach the postseason. In Game 1 of the ALDS, he allowed one run and four hits over eight innings, outdueling Johan Santana and earning the win in a 32 victory over the Twins and setting the stage for an Oakland sweep. Zito did not fare as well in Game 1 of the AL Championship Series ALCS against the Tigers, allowing five runs over 3 23 innings in a 51 defeat. The Tigers went on to sweep the Athletics in four games. Zito replaced his agent Arn Tellem with Scott Boras in July 2006. Zito was a focal point of the 2006 trade deadline, and was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that if the Mets were unwilling to trade Milledge, the Athletics might be interested in Aaron Heilman and John Maine. However, Athletics' general manager Billy Beane decided to keep Zito for the rest of the season. Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth 126 million, plus 18 million option for 2014 with a 7 million buyout. Zito's contract on December 29, 2006, became the highest for any pitcher in Major League history at the time. During spring training in 2007, he and Barry Bonds made shirts that read Don't ask me, ask Barry with an arrow pointing to the other Barry. By all accounts, Zito and Bonds got along well during their short time as teammates, and Zito made a point of saying he would stand by Bonds through onslaughts from the media. In his first start as a member of the Giants, Opening Day April 3 , Zito went five innings and allowed two earned runs against the San Diego Padres. He would take the loss. In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zito would earn his first win as a member of the Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. I've been trying to have a good game , Zito said. You can't try to do anything. You either do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I wasn't aggressive. On May 18, Zito made his return to Oakland as a Giant. He lasted only four innings as he gave up seven runs while walking seven, including two bases loaded walks. The A's beat the Giants, 153. He faced his old team again on June 9, this time in San Francisco. Zito pitched four innings while giving up three earned runs on nine hits in a 60 defeat. Zito made his first Major League relief appearance on August 5 against the Padres due to an early exit by starter Noah Lowry and an overworked bullpen. He pitched a scoreless seventh inning. He recorded his first career run batted in RBI two days later against the Nationals' Mike Bacsik, in the same game that Barry Bonds hit his record breaking 756th career home run. After Zito's start on August 12, his ERA was 5.13. Over his final nine starts, he posted the fifth best ERA in the NL, at 3.10. He also had a 32 record. He admitted that he had put pressure on himself to perform because of the large contract and was learning that he just needed to be himself. Zito also said that it had been difficult for him to adjust to a new league, team, and ballpark. On the final day of the season, in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, Zito allowed two runs on five hits and had four strikeouts in an 112 win. For the first time in his career, Zito had a losing record, as he finished the season at 1113. He failed to reach 200 innings 196 23 for the first time since 2000 and posted a career high 4.53 ERA. Zito began the 2008 season as the oldest starter and the veteran presence in the Giants' starting rotation. In April, Zito went 06 with a 7.53 ERA and 11 strikeouts. He was the third pitcher in the last 52 years to go 06 before May 1. On April 28, the Giants moved him to the bullpen. Zito did not make an appearance out of the bullpen and returned to the rotation on May 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game, Zito allowed five hits and two earned runs over five innings and took the loss, his seventh of the season. On May 23, Zito collected his first win of the 2008 season against the Florida Marlins. On June 13, Zito became the first pitcher to record 10 losses in the Major Leagues following a 51 loss to Oakland. His 5.1 walks per nine innings pitched for the season, 51.5 first pitch strike percentage, and 14 sacrifice flies allowed, were all the worst in the majors. Beginning June 25, Zito saw some improvement, as he posted an 86 record for the rest of the season to go along with a 4.33 ERA. He finished the year 1017 with a career high 5.15 ERA and 120 strikeouts. His 17 losses led the National League and were the second worst total in San Francisco history Ray Sadecki lost 18 games in 1968 . The 2009 season seemed to mark a rebound in Zito's pitching performance. Though starting the season 02 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended the season with an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 had it not been for his first two starts. Though going only 1013 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support the second lowest in the major leagues than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 813 innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season. Zito started the 2010 season by pitching six shutout innings against the Houston Astros to earn a win it was the first time he had won his season opening start since 2003. On April 24, Zito stifled the St. Louis Cardinals, throwing eight shutout innings with ten strikeouts for his third victory of the season, en route to starting the season 50 for the first time in his career. It was the best start by a Giants' pitcher since 2004, when Lowry started 60. On June 12, 2010, Zito earned his first win against his former team, the Athletics, which gave him victories against every MLB team. Zito is one of eighteen pitchers to record a win against all 30 MLB teams, and the first pitcher to accomplish the feat while only with two clubs Through June 12, Zito was 72 with a 3.10 ERA. After a strong start to the season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 212 with a 4.97 ERA the rest of the way. He finished the season 914 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sanchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. In fact, he was left completely off the Giants' 25 man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad. Nevertheless, he won his first World Series ring as a member of the full roster. Early in the 2011 season Zito experienced his first trip to the disabled list after an injury to his right foot during a fielding play. His replacement, Ryan Vogelsong, excelled, but Zito was able to rejoin the rotation when he returned in June because Sanchez was placed on the disabled list with left biceps tendinitis. Zito pitched well in his first few starts back, pitching well against the Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Padres en route to three Giants wins, but later resumed his struggle, going 03 with a 10.91 ERA over his next three starts. He returned to the disabled list after aggravating his right foot injury ironically, his trip to the DL made room for Sanchez to return to the rotation. On August 13, Zito injured his right ankle on another fielding play in a Triple A rehab start, sidelining him for another month. Zito returned from the DL on September 11 but was used out of the bullpen for the rest of the year he posted a 9.00 ERA over his final four games. In a career low 13 games nine starts , he had a 34 record, a career high 5.87 ERA, 32 strikeouts, and 24 walks in a career low 53 23 innings. After struggling mightily during spring training in which he threw with a new crouched delivery, Zito began the 2012 season with a start against the Rockies on April 9. He threw arguably one of the best games of his career, throwing a complete game shutout while giving up just 4 hits in the 70 Giants victory. It was his first shutout since 2003 when he was a member of the Oakland Athletics. In a June 3 home game matchup with the Cubs, Zito pitched four hit shutout ball into the ninth inning for a 20 Giants win and brought his season ERA below 3.00. In earning the win, Zito earned his 150th career win, becoming the 246th pitcher to hit the mark. Zito had a hand in the Giants' second road shutout win of the season when he pitched seven innings, allowing three hits and recording four strikeouts, in a July 17 game versus the Atlanta Braves. The win pushed his season record to 86. Zito would go on to finish the season with a 158 record, his most wins in a season with the Giants, while sporting a 4.15 ERA. Zito faced off against the Reds in Game 4 of the National League Division Series NLDS on October 10 and struggled, being pulled in the third inning after allowing two runs. However, the Giants went on to win 83. The Giants, after losing the first two games of the series, became the first team to rally from a 20 deficit in an NLDS, winning the series in five games. On October 19, 2012, Zito rebounded and pitched arguably the best game of his career, tossing 723 shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series NLCS , earning the win. It was his first postseason win since 2006 and according to Zito himself, was the biggest win of his career. That same day, Zito inspired the Twitter hashtag rallyzito, which, behind the efforts of Giants fans, was trending worldwide on the social networking site. The Giants, after trailing 31 in the series, prevailed in seven games. On October 24, 2012, Zito pitched in the first World Series of his career. As the Game 1 starter, Zito earned the win, outpitching Detroit's Justin Verlander by tossing 5 2 3 innings of one run ball. Zito also added an RBI single en route to an 83 Giants win. The Giants went on to sweep the Tigers in the World Series, and Zito went 20 with a 1.69 earned run average in the postseason. Zito did not lose a single game after August 2 against the Mets, and San Francisco won his last 14 starts. On April 5, 2013, during the Giants' home opener, Zito held the Cardinals scoreless over seven shutout innings, earning the 10 win. He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal offensive contribution at the plate against the Rockies in a 100 win to complete a 3 game series sweep. It was the Giants' 16th straight victory in a row in games started by Zito including the 2012 regular season and postseason , the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left handed pitcher Carl Hubbell. However, Zito struggled for the rest of the season, going 210 with a 6.24 ERA after April 21 and losing his rotation spot a couple times late in the year. On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy decided to give Zito one final start with the Giants as a tribute to his tenure with the team. Zito responded by allowing two runs one earned over five innings and earning the win in a 74 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay playing his final game as the Giants beat the Padres 76. He finished the 2013 season at 511 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for 7 million. After taking a year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league contract to return to the Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25 man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the next to last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24 appearances 22 starts , he accrued an 87 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts. Zito revealed in an interview that he had learned the Athletics would not be bringing him up to the major league club in September. However, following a season ending injury to Jesse Chavez, Oakland purchased Zito's contract from Triple A on September 16, placing him on the major league roster. Zito made his first major league appearance on September 20, pitching an inning in relief. On September 26, 2015, Zito started for the Athletics against Hudson and the Giants in a matchup that was arranged as a tribute to the A's Big Three of the early 2000s. Both pitchers received lengthy standing ovations from the sold out Coliseum crowd which included the third Big Three member, Mulder upon leaving the game. On October 19, 2015, Zito announced his retirement from baseball in an article for The Players' Tribune. Zito's fastball has hovered between 84 miles per hour 135 km h and 88 miles per hour 142 km h . He augments it with a circle changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch. His curveball was voted the best in the Major Leagues in a player poll conducted by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he had never seen anything like Zito's curveball, commenting It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you're not going to hit it. Since mid 2004, Zito has added a two seam fastball and a cutterslider hybrid to his arsenal. In the 2009 season, this cutter slider became a prominent part of his repertoire, being used more frequently than his changeup. Zito's diminished velocity at the start of the 2007 season his fastball velocity slowed to 8385 miles per hour 134137 km h and loss of command were the key mechanical reasons for his struggles that year, as he more often got behind in the count and had to rely more on his fastball. During the 2009 season, Zito made changes to his delivery, lowering his arm slot from an over the top angle to a three quarters delivery. This change helped his fastball velocity go back up to the 8689 miles per hour 138143 km h range as well as sharpening the break of his curveball. However, in 2011, he was once again in the 8487 miles per hour 135140 km h range with his fastball. In 2012, Zito relied mostly on his two seam fastball and cutter, and reduced his reliance on the four seamer, which was the slowest four seamer in MLB among starting pitchers that year, at 84.6 miles per hour 136.2 km h . Addressing his finesse pitching style, Zito said, My fastball is set up by my offspeed, that's no secret. So if I can command my fastball to both sides of the plate and throw most of my offspeed for strikes, I'll get them to miss the barrel. That's what I'm going for. From 2000 through 2004 with the Athletics, Zito, Hudson, and Mulder were known as the Big Three. Of the three, Zito had the highest single season win total and was the only one to win the Cy Young Award. Zito's .618 winning percentage is 10th all time in Athletics history. His 6.896 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched ranks seventh, his 1,096 strikeouts rank eighth, and his 222 games started rank 10th. Zito also holds a couple more dubious positions on Oakland's list his 148 home runs allowed rank fifth, and his 65 hit by pitches rank fourth although he trails Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Rube Waddell in that category . Zito's .821 winning percentage in 2002 is tied with Bender's in 1910 for 10th among Athletics' single season totals. His 8.608 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 2001 rank seventh, and his 205 strikeouts in 2001 are tied for 10th with Dave Stewart's 1987 total and Todd Stottlemyre's 1995 total . Zito's regular season performance with the Giants was less successful he went 6380 with a 4.62 ERA. However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. Zito did not pitch in the playoffs that year, but did pitch in the 2012 postseason, saving the Giants' season by pitching them to a Game 5 victory in the NLCS against the Cardinals, and then outdueling Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. As a hitter, Zito batted .102 with 11 RBI. His 35 career hits were all singles, putting him 2nd on the all time list of most plate appearances 418 without an extra base hit. Zito started playing guitar in 1999 as a way to pass time on road trips. He had not considered music as a profession until his sister, Sally Zito, asked him to play guitar in her band with which he played during the offseason from 2000 to 2007. It was then that he began writing songs in preparation for a career after baseball. His 2015 comeback bid found him playing the majority of the season in Nashville, Tennessee, the home of country music. He used his time off to learn from the city's music industry professionals and to pursue songwriting. Zito released his first EP, titled No Secrets, on January 27, 2017. The collection contains six songs either written or co written by Zito. He later co wrote and sang vocals for a theme song for the Nashville Sounds, titled That Sound . Zito became engaged to former Miss Missouri Amber Seyer in April 2011, and they were married on December 3, 2011. His father, Joe Zito, who died June 19, 2013, at the age of 84, composed and arranged music for Nat King Cole in the early 1960s ca.196164 and arranged for the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra. Zito's mother Roberta was a musician who sang in a choral group known as The Merry Young Souls and with Nat King Cole and his band. Zito is also a musician. He plays guitar, and he co wrote the song Butterflies that was used in the Eddie Murphy film A Thousand Words. Zito's uncle is television actor Patrick Duffy. Zito and wife Amber gave birth to their first child, a son named Mars, in July 2014. They adopted their second child, a son named Mercer Joseph Zito, in May 2017. Zito is known for his idiosyncrasies and his offbeat personality. Early in his career, Zito dyed his hair blue. He earned the nicknames Planet Zito and Captain Quirk when with Oakland. Zito says he likes the way his uniform number 75 looks because the 7 and the 5 are like a shelf to hold the name Zito up. He surfs and practices yoga. He has done yoga poses in the outfield, and meditated before games. Zito practices Transcendental Meditation and supports the David Lynch Foundation. Zito has said, however, that he believes terms such as flaky or hippie have been applied to him by people who do not know him well enough to know better. Zito was raised in a spiritual, metaphysical type church that was founded by his grandmother and that his mother, Roberta, who died in 2008, formerly preached at. In 2001, Zito espoused a universal life force that he credited with his midseason turnaround. He said that he discovered this force by reading Creative Mind by Ernest Holmes. However, in August 2011, Zito became a Christian, saying he committed to Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. Zito explained that God got his attention through his being left off the 2010 Giants postseason roster and a car accident and freak foot injury in early 2011. He got a tattoo his only one of a golden calf on the inside of his right bicep as a reminder for him to not worship false idols and to remember that God comes first. Zito said that his wife is a Christian as well.

Zito has said, Having placed my full identity into my baseball career for most of my life, only to have it stripped away during the 2010 World Series run is what led me to discover my true identity. Not in a game, but in Jesus Christ. Zito founded the charity Strikeouts For Troops. The charity provides comforts of home and works to lift the spirits and morale of injured US troops and offers support to military families. In 2010, Zito announced that he would donate 1,500 for every strikeout in the GiantsPadres game on September 11. There were a total of 14 strikeouts in the game. In 2003, Zito portrayed a United States Navy petty officer in an episode of JAG on CBS. Zito's character, a pitcher, faced assault charges after hitting a Marine with a ball during the annual Navy Marine all star baseball game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry%20Zito
"Abu'l Mughira Ziyad ibn Abihi Arabic , romanized Abul Mughira Ziyad ibn Abihi c. 622 673 , also known as Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan Arabic , romanized Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan , was an administrator and statesman of the successive Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates in the mid 7th century. He served as the governor of Basra in 665670 and ultimately the first governor of Iraq and virtual viceroy of the eastern Caliphate between 670 and his death. Ziyad's parentage is obscure, but he was raised among the Banu Thaqif in Ta'if and arrived with his adoptive tribesmen in Basra upon its foundation in 636 as the Muslim Arabs' springboard for the conquest of the Sasanian Empire. He was initially employed by the city's first governor, Utba ibn Ghazwan al Mazini, and was kept on as a scribe or secretary by his successors. Caliph Ali r. 656661 appointed Ziyad to Fars to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to Ali's caliphate after the latter's assassination in 661 and the subsequent rule of Ali's enemy, Mu'awiya I r. 661680 . The latter ultimately overcame Ziyad's opposition, formally recognized him as his own paternal half brother and appointed him governor of Basra. Ziyad's inaugural speech, in which he announced his carrot and stick policies to the city's turbulent population, is celebrated in Arab history for its eloquence. After the death of Kufa's governor, Ziyad's mentor al Mughira ibn Shu'ba, Mu'awiya made Ziyad the first governor of a unified Iraqi province. He administratively reorganized the garrison cities and minted Sasanian style silver dirhams in his own name. He firmly established Arab power and recommenced conquests in the Caliphate's easternmost province of Khurasan by relocating there 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against Tukharistan, Balkh and Quhistan. Though the mass resettlement improved Iraq's economic and political conditions by siphoning off Arab tribal soldiers from the overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils, the move had major ramifications for the Caliphate as the descendants of these Khurasani Arab troops formed the army that toppled the Umayyads in 750. Ziyad died near Kufa in 673, but his sons Ubayd Allah, Abd al Rahman, Salm, Abbad and Yazid went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of Iraq, Khurasan and Sijistan. Ziyad was the subject of early Arabic biographies and is remembered in Arab history as one of the four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator. His administration in Iraq served as a model for his successors. Ziyad was likely born in Ta'if in 622 or 623 24. His precise parentage is obscure, hence his frequent name in the sources as Ziyad ibn Abihi Ziyad son of his father . He was the illegitimate son of a certain Sumayya, his father being unknown. The origins of Sumayya are also obscure. The 9th century historians al Baladhuri and Awana ibn al Hakam both relate that she had been a slave living in Kashkar, though the former asserts she belonged to a member of the Banu Yashkur, a branch of the Arab tribe of Banu Bakr, and the latter states she belonged to a Persian dehqan landowning magnate . In the narrative of al Baladhuri, Sumayya's Yashkuri owner embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in Ta'if by al Harith ibn Kalada, a physician from the Thaqif clan resident in the city as a reward for his services, Ibn Kalada was gifted Sumayya. In Awana's narrative, Sumayya was given to Ibn Kalada by the Persian dehqan after he treated him. In any case, she was ultimately given to Ubayd, a Greek or Syrian slave belonging to Ibn Kalada's wife. Though Ziyad alludes to his Persian origin in a poem, his family claimed that Sumayya was not a slave, but the daughter of a certain al A'war from the Zayd Manat clan of the Arab tribe of Banu Tamim. During the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr r. 632634 , Ziyad embraced Islam, which opened the world to him , according to historian Julius Wellhausen. He later became one of the first settlers of the Arab garrison town of Basra. Prior to the city's founding in 638, the Muslim troops fighting on the Iraqi front used the pre existing, ruined Persian village on the site as their military camp. Ziyad arrived there with the sons of Ibn Kalada, Nafi and Abu Bakra Nufay. The latter's family gained preeminence in the city, having acquired large landholdings there. Abu Bakra's brother in law, Utba ibn Ghazwan al Mazini, had established the initial camp at Basra in 635 and was the founder and first governor of the city. The administrative skills of Ziyad became apparent from the time of his adolescence and Utba charged him with minor tasks in the Basran diwan bureaucracy during the reign of Caliph Umar r. 634644 . In 635, Utba tasked him with distributing to the Arab troops the war spoils from the capture of al Ubulla Apologos , a town immediately east of Basra. According to the modern historian, Isaac Hasson, Ziyad distinguished himself as an intelligent and open minded secretary, who was devoted to his master and to public service ... he showed an unusual aptitude for accounting and had an excellent command of epistolary art . His skills and his assignment by Basra's military governor Abu Musa al Ash'ari as his acting replacement while he was on a military campaign gained the attention of Caliph Umar. He brought Ziyad to Medina, the center of the nascent Muslim state, where he further tested his skills Ziyad's performance earned him a reward of 1,000 dirhams by Umar, which he used to purchase the freedom of his mother or his stepfather Ubayd. Soon after his return to Basra, Ziyad was made Utba's katib scribe or secretary . After Utba's death, Ziyad continued his service as katib under his successors Abu Musa al Ash'ari and al Mughira ibn Shu'ba, a member of the Thaqif who became Ziyad's mentor. When al Mughira was recalled by Umar to Medina in 638 due to charges of adultery by three accusers, including Abu Bakra Nufay and a certain Shibl ibn Ma'bad al Bajali, both of whom were Ziyad's maternal half brothers, Ziyad was also recalled to give his own testimony. His statement was partial toward al Mughira and as a result, the charges were dismissed and the accusers were flogged. During the reign of Caliph Uthman r. 644656 , Ziyad served the caliph's appointee to Basra, Abd Allah ibn Amir. Uthman's successor Ali r. 656661 appointed Abd Allah ibn Abbas governor of Basra and entrusted Ziyad with collection of the province's kharaj land tax and supervision of the treasury. According to Hasson, Ali's appreciation of Ziyad's talents were so great that he mandated Ibn Abbas heed Ziyad's counsel. When Ibn Abbas left Basra in 657 to accompany Ali at the Battle of Siffin against the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, he left Ziyad as his acting governor. During this period, he stamped out an uprising by the Banu Tamim, a major military tribal faction in the city, with critical assistance from another Basran faction, the Azd. After Ali returned from Siffin, his appointee to the district of Fars, Sahl ibn Hunayf, was ousted by its inhabitants, after which he dispatched Ziyad. The people of Fars were satisfied with Ziyad's leadership and he was able to collect the district's kharaj. He remained in Fars through the remainder of Ali's rule, which ended with the caliph's assassination in 661 and the foundation of the Umayyad Caliphate under Mu'awiya. Afterward, he remained headquartered in a fortress in the vicinity of Istakhr. Of Ali's appointees, he held out the longest from recognizing Mu'awiya's caliphate. Mu'awiya's agent, Busr ibn Abi Artat, pressured Ziyad by capturing and threatening to kill three of his sons in Basra. Ziyad's half brother Abu Bakra interceded with Mu'awiya and Ziyad's sons were released. He finally surrendered to Mu'awiya's rule in 662 63 after the intercession of al Mughira, who Mu'awiya had appointed governor of Kufa, the other main Arab garrison town of Iraq. In the deal reached, the revenues from Fars owed to the caliphal treasury were split between Ziyad and al Mughira, which Mu'awiya ignored. Ziyad moved to Kufa and maintained intimate ties with al Mughira and his family. Mu'awiya formally recognized Ziyad as a son of his father Abu Sufyan. The motion was initiated when Ziyad sought clarification from the caliph about rumors of Abu Sufyan's biological paternity. According to Wellhausen, Mu'awiya summoned Ziyad to Damascus and recognized him as his paternal half brother, so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family . The decision was seen as scandalous by the Umayyad ruling family. Mu'awiya's son Yazid and members from other branches of the clan, namely the extended family of Marwan ibn al Hakam in Medina and Abd Allah ibn Amir, the governor of Basra, protested or threatened action against the decision. Ibn Amir and the Marwanids were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes. Yazid's relations with Ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about the event were spread by Marwan's brother Abd al Rahman. Muslim scholars generally viewed the episode as one of Mu'awiya's most disreputable actions. Realizing that Ziyad had both the abilities and the all important local connections to be his right hand man in Basra , Mu'awiya appointed him governor of the province, according to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy. He entered office in June or July 665, issuing an inaugural carrot and stick speech to Basra's restless population. According to Hasson it was considered a masterpiece of eloquence . Wellhausen describes it as celebrated and the one which was called a without a preface because it skipped the traditional introductions praising God and blessing the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The speech is translated as follows Ye are putting relationship before religion, ye are excusing and sheltering your criminals, and tearing down the protecting laws sanctified by Islam. Beware of prowling by night I will kill every one who is found at night in the streets. Beware of the arbitrary summons of relationship I will cut out the tongue of every one who raises the cry. Whoever pushes anyone into the water, whoever sets fire to another's house, whoever breaks into a house, whoever opens a grave, him will I punish for it. I make every family responsible for those belonging to it. Hatred towards myself I do not punish, but only crime. Many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of my presence, and many who are building their hopes upon it will be undeceived. I rule you with the authority of God and care for your maintenance out of the wealth of God. From you I demand obedience, and ye can demand from me justice. In whatsoever I fall short, three things there are in which I shall not be lacking at any time I shall be ready to listen to anyone I shall pay you your pension at the proper time, and I shall not send you to war too far away or keep you in the field overlong. Do not let yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me it would go ill with you if ye did. Many heads do I see tottering let each man see to it that his own remains on his shoulders A number of punitive measures along the lines of those cited in his speech were taken by Ziyad at the start of his term and largely gained for him the Basrans' respect. He established unprecedented levels of security in the city, its Iranian dependencies to the east, i.e. Fars and Kerman, and the Arabian Desert to the south. The Kharijites of Basra, many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics, submitted to his authority. Under Ziyad, Basra began to take shape as a proper Islamic city. His rule saw the crude mud bricks of the city's homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a congregational mosque and residential palace. In the words of the historian Charles Pellat, Ziyad, to a certain degree, be considered as the artisan of the town's prosperity . His effective rule cemented Mu'awiya's confidence in him. After the death of al Mughira in 670, Kufa and its dependencies were attached to Ziyad's governorship, making him the practical viceroy over Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate. He was the first to serve as the dual governor of Kufa and Basra and divided his residence between the two towns. In the winter he stayed in Basra and left Amr ibn Hurayth as his deputy in Kufa, while he resided in Kufa in the summer, leaving Samura ibn Jundab as his deputy in Basra. His strong grip in Kufa marked a shift from al Mughira's hands off approach. A source of disturbance for him in Kufa was the agitation of the Alids, partisans of Caliph Ali, led by Hujr ibn Adi al Kindi, who disapproved of Umayyad rule and led the first open calls for the caliphate to be held by Ali's progeny. Though al Mughira tolerated Hujr, Ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent. He succeeded in turning most of Hujr's supporters among the Kufan troops against him. In 671, he had Hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to Damascus for punishment, where six, including Hujr, were executed in Adra for their refusal to renounce support for the Alids. One of the men, Abd al Rahman ibn Hassan al Anazi, who was spared by Mu'awiya later insulted the caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn Ali and was sent back to Ziyad, who had him buried alive as punishment. To end the chaos in the amsar garrisons of Basra and Kufa, Ziyad administratively reformed the two towns. From the reign of Caliph Umar, their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for the distribution of military stipends. There were seven such tribal groups in Kufa and Basra and at the head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to the government. Gradually, this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent. There was no control on Arab immigration into the amsar, resulting in overpopulation and in turn, increased competition over fewer resources. Ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader, which resulted in Kufa's reorganization into quarters and Basra into fifths. This measure enabled easier control of the two towns' inhabitants. Ziyad undertook further reforms in Kufa and Basra, including regularizing the timely payment of stipends, embarking on agricultural development schemes, including canal digging, and minting Sasanian style dirhams silver coins that bore his name as Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan . Ziyad's authority extended to Khurasan and Sijistan, the far eastern regions of the Caliphate which were considered dependencies of the Basra garrison. The Arab conquests of these areas in the 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish the Caliphate's power. Moreover, the political instability of the final years of Uthman's caliphate and the First Muslim Civil War saw local revolts which further weakened Arab authority. In 655, the Sasanian prince Peroz III, backed by the army of Tukharistan, attempted to reassert Persian power. Under previous caliphs, the vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under the leadership of Arab tribal chiefs. Governance was largely left to local princes. Fearing a Persian resurgence, which a fragmentary division of Khurasan could afford, Ziyad centralized the administration of the province in the small Arab garrison at Merv. To relieve Basra's fiscal pressures, Ziyad recommenced the Muslim conquests in Central Asia. He organized the Arab military presence in Khurasan. In 667, he dispatched an army to the region under his lieutenant general al Hakam ibn Amr al Ghifari. The latter conquered lower Tukharistan and Gharchistan and temporarily crossed the Oxus river into Transoxiana, forcing Peroz to withdraw into Tang China. Meanwhile, Ziyad's removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to the Iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off the payrolls. He dispatched 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Basra and Kufa to permanently settle in the Merv oasis of Khurasan. The resettlement of these troops may have been a means to defuse possibly dangerous developments relating to the Arab tribal influx in the two garrison towns, according to the historian Gerald Hawting. As a result, the Merv oasis became home to the largest concentration of Muslims outside of the Fertile Crescent. Al Hakam's successor, Ghalib ibn Abd Allah al Laythi, was less successful in subduing Tukharistan and Ziyad sent another of his lieutenants, Rabi ibn Ziyad al Harithi, to stamp out the revolts in the conquered areas in 670 71. Rabi proceeded to secure the capitulation of Balkh, whose inhabitants had revolted against Arab rule, in a treaty and then destroyed the army of the Hepthalite princes in Quhistan. In 673, Rabi's son Abd Allah extended Arab rule to the western banks of the Oxus and established tributary agreements with the fortress towns of Amul and Zamm. To solidify the territorial gains and supply the manpower for further conquests Ziyad intended for the Arab troops, initially concentrated in the Merv oasis, to colonize other parts of Khurasan. They were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under Ziyad's successors. Ziyad died in the village of al Thawiyya near Kufa on 23 August 673. A year after his death, Mu'awiya appointed Ziyad's son Ubayd Allah as governor of Khurasan and then Basra. Under Mu'awiya's son and successor, Caliph Yazid I, the governorship of Kufa was also handed to Ubayd Allah. Ziyad's sons Abd al Rahman and Salm served successively as governors of Khurasan in 678680 and 680683 84, and two other sons, Abbad and Yazid, served successively as governors of Sijistan in 673680 81 and 680 81. The Thaqif, which had maintained close ties with the Umayyads since the pre Islamic era and played an integral role in the Muslim conquest of Iraq, provided the Umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in Iraq, including al Mughira, Ziyad, Ubayd Allah and al Hajjaj ibn Yusuf r. 694714 , and the Muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than the caliphs on whose behalf they ruled. Along with his mentor al Mughira, Ziyad and his family were part of what some must have seen as a Thaqafi mafia controlling Iraq and the east, according to Kennedy. Among the most gifted governors of the Umayyad era , Ziyad had a good understanding of his task as governor, and had a great influence on his successors concerning the conception of the duties of rulers , according to Hasson. According to Kennedy, Ziyad's settlement of Iraqi Arab troops in Khurasan had extremely important consequences for Islamic history as the descendants of those settlers, who were known as ahl Khurasan, ultimately destroyed the Umayyad Caliphate in 750. The execution of Hujr and his six partisans, all of whom had been prominent men in their own right, also led to deep seated resentment among their Kufan kinsmen. The incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro Alid risings. The death of Hujr represented the first political execution in Islamic history, and he and his companions are viewed as martyrs by Shia Muslims. Ziyad was alleged to have ordered cruel acts against some Alid partisans, including crucifixions. Interest in Ziyad's biography emerged early on among the traditional Muslim historians, with works written about him by Abu Mikhnaf d. 774 , Hisham ibn al Kalbi d. 819 and Abd al Aziz ibn Yahya al Jaludi d. 943 . He is considered a highly skilled orator among Arabs, with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in Islamic literature and Arabic rhetoric, polemics and histories. He is counted alongside Mu'awiya, al Mughira and Amr ibn al As, the conqueror and governor of Egypt, as one of the four duhat i.e. shrewds among the Arab statesmen of his era. According to the medieval Syrian historian Ibn Asakir d. 1176 , Ziyad had expert knowledge of the Qur'an, its tenets and Islamic jurisprudence. A medieval Basran historian, Muhammad ibn Imran al Abdi, related that Ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to the hadiths about Umar and proclaimed about them This is the truth we hear This is the sunna Ziyad is credited by a number of sources for transmitting sayings by the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Umar as the original transmitter.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziyad%20ibn%20Abihi
"Lauren Zizes zasiz is a recurring fictional character from the Fox musical comedy drama series, Glee. The character is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink, and has appeared in Glee since the season one episode Wheels , first broadcast on November 11, 2009. Lauren was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. She is a member of New Directions, the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her interact with other members of the glee club and form a relationship with Noah Puckerman Mark Salling . Lauren is also the president of the AV club, and a member of the school's wrestling team. She joins the glee club in the show's second season, putting her in close contact with some of the shows main characters. Following the character's significantly expanded role in the second season, Fink's portrayal has received predominantly positive reviews. Rosie O'Donnell criticized the character, saying that Fink was unattractive and therefore a bad representation of fat people, but later apologized for these remarks. Lauren made her solo musical debut in the second season, performing The Waitresses' I Know What Boys Like in the episode Comeback . The song was well received by critics, and was released as a single, available for download it was subsequently included on the EP released in September 2011 through the Target chain, Glee The Music, Dance Party. Although Lauren also appears in ensemble musical performances, Fink is not credited as a vocalist on the series' soundtrack albums. Lauren's role was reduced in the beginning of the third season, and she made a final, non speaking appearance in the third episode, Asian F . After this, it was confirmed she would appear once again in Glee and doing so in the fourth season's episode Sadie Hawkins , which premiered on 24 January 2013. After this, she made numerous appearances in flashbacks before appearing one final time in the series finale, Dreams Come True , during the performance of OneRepublic's I Lived by the glee club's alumni. Throughout the first season of Glee, Lauren makes numerous guest appearances. She is a member of the McKinley High wrestling team, as well as president of the AV club. She first appears in the episode Wheels , where she unsuccessfully tries out for a spot on the cheerleading team. She reappears in Hell O , when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester assembles a group of unpopular, lonely students, whom she dubs the Old Maid's Club . Lauren later helps glee club co captain Rachel Berry Lea Michele to rig hidden microphones in the choir room to prove that the rest of the glee club are not pulling their weight in rehearsals. She is later seen as the leader of a group of goths who idolize Twilight character Edward Cullen. Lauren's role becomes more prominent in the second season. Glee club member Puck Mark Salling asks her to join New Directions so they will have enough members to qualify for a show choir competition. Lauren accepts, on the condition that she gets seven minutes in heaven with him, though it is later revealed that she became bored with Puck's kissing style after three minutes. In the Valentine's Day themed episode Silly Love Song , Puck reveals that he has fallen in love with Lauren, and serenades her with Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls . She finds his song choice insulting and stands him up on a pre Valentine's date, but eventually agrees to spend Valentine's Day with him as friends. Lauren makes her solo debut in the following episode, where she performs a rendition of I Know What Boys Like. Puck helps her, by advising her to picture the other members in their underwear, which she does in her timid turned confident performance. In the episode, Sexy , Lauren enlists Puck to make a sex tape with her, as she believes the publicity will make her a star, but they give up the idea when they learn it would constitute child pornography, as both are underage. In Born This Way , Lauren reveals to Puck that she'd been a child beauty queen, Miss Tiara Toddler , before she gained weight and became ineligible Puck tells her he will run a campaign for her to become prom queen, and be her king. When Quinn, who is prom queen frontrunner, sees Lauren putting up posters for her own candidacy, she confronts Lauren, and the ensuing encounter is heated. Lauren decides to dig up dirt on Quinn as a campaign tactic, and aided by Puck, discovers that Quinn used to be overweight and unpopular before slimming down and transferring to McKinley Lauren then plasters the school with pictures of the old Quinn, humiliating her. But the tactic backfires, making Quinn more popular, and hurting Lauren's candidacy. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, Quinn says she respects Lauren, and the two reach an understanding. Neither Lauren nor Puck win the race for prom queen and king, but they remain a couple they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City, where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams. This defeat leads Lauren to quit the glee club at the beginning of the third season and break up with Puck. Lauren is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest appearances throughout the first season, and became a member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode Special Education . Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, I didn't quite believe it at first, I thought I was getting Punk'd. She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like the luckiest girl in the world . Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and its just so inspirational. When asked about her casting process, Fink said I auditioned for the pilot and they brought me in a bunch, which was exciting for me because they kept bringing me in. Eventually I got the Lauren Zizes part They had me sing for the pilot and it was very on the fly because Glee works very quickly. The first episode I appeared in I was the wrestler and I was trying out for cheerleading. Then they asked me to come out and sing for Ryan Murphy and the director and I sang and they were like, Okay, great We shot it and then I just kept coming back. Fink does not know how long her character will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her. Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Crisswho's exploded with popularityand Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough only on the outside Lauren can deliciously out sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight talking that really has me sold. In her first episode, it is revealed that Lauren is a member of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce. Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. Shes on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was a lot more than just bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line Theres a word for people who do things like that in the real world It's 'asshole'. He went on to add Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups well, by Bust Magazine as a new kind of plus sized heroinean obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls, she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'. Journalist James Poniewozik of Time magazine commented of the episode Silly Love Songs It was the kind of twist Glee can sell, partly because of the way the characters are established in retrospect, you can see how a really strong woman who rejects him is a turn on for Puck and because of how well its cast Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren, and sells her confidence and abrasiveness in a way that makes her a person, not an engineered positive body image model . And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on the nose song choices, Fat Bottomed Girls was just a perfect choice and performancenot just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse. Over the course of Glee's second season, Lauren forms a relationship with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled Special Education . After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port a potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, it comes down to whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about the two of them together that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility. Television critics have responded positively to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN said of the episode Silly Love Songs The absolute best part of Silly Love Songs was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, it was nice to even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls, induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that bad at all. But its always fun to watch Salling sing, and its always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings. In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck a lot less assured than before, but Entertainment Weekly's Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes as endearing as they are unrealistic , and E Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that the ice around heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo. Lauren has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Canning praised Fink's performance in the episode Silly Love Songs , as well as Lauren's dialog. Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is able to take the concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness. Reiter felt that in Comeback , new characters Lauren and Sam managed to shine . Rosie O'Donnell reacted negatively to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In an interview with Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of I Know What Boys Like underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren so unlikable, and questioned why the producers had not cast a pretty heavy girl . Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, Oh, Ashley I love your swagger your acting your face your heart as a famous fat person I am often asked about the issue... I love the story line I love the show and if in any way something I said hurt you I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it...as I know you canthe often misquoted Rosie. Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just become a source of great comedy is that because she's full figured No. Is it because her character is well written Yes. Its kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called Lauren's performance of I Know What Boys Like the highlight of Comeback . Gonzalez was less than enthused. She graded it C , after deductions , and said the only reason it started with a C was due to it being interspersed with shots of the cast in their underwear. Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed, and questioned Lauren's spot in the glee club, commenting her brazen character never ceases to please, but it's just not believable that she would join the glee club if she cannot sing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren%20Zizes
"The Yugoslav minelayer Zmaj Dragon was built in Germany as a seaplane tender for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 19281930. She does not appear to have been much used in that role and was converted to a minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans when they invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, the ship was renamed German Drache, lit. 'Dragon' and redesignated as an aircraft tender and later as a troop transport, before she was rebuilt as a minelayer in 1942. Drache laid one minefield in 1943 that sank two Allied destroyers and badly damaged a third in the Aegean Sea. Drache was also used by the Germans to evaluate the shipboard use of helicopters for reconnaissance purposes. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 at Samos and scrapped in place after the end of World War II. The Royal Yugoslav Navy operated a series of seaplane bases on the Dalmatian Coast before World War II and decided that it needed a ship to transport seaplanes between them and to rescue downed aircraft after operations as had been common during World War I. It decided on the smallest possible ship that could carry supplies and spare parts for ten seaplanes. Zmaj was 83 meters 272 ft 4 in long overall. She had a beam of 13 meters 42 ft 8 in and, at deep load, a draft of 4 meters 13 ft 1 in . She displaced 1,870 metric tons 1,840 long tons at standard load. Her two propellers were powered by a pair of eight cylinder, four stroke MAN Diesel engines that had a maximum output of 3,260 shaft horsepower 2,430 kW . This was enough to propel her to a speed of 15 knots 28 km h 17 mph . She carried a total of 140 tonnes 140 long tons of fuel which gave her a range of 4,000 nautical miles 7,400 km 4,600 mi . She lacked a traditional funnel as her engine uptakes were taken up through the lattice mainmast. The ship was fitted with two single 55 caliber 83.5 millimeter 3.3 in Skoda anti aircraft AA guns, one each mounted on the forecastle and the stern. They had a maximum elevation of 85 and fired a 10 kilogram 22 lb shell at a muzzle velocity of 800 m s 2,625 ft s . The guns had a rate of fire of 12 rounds per minute and had a maximum ceiling of 11,300 m 37,100 ft . Four 40 millimeter 1.6 in 67 caliber Skoda AA guns were mounted between the bridge and the mainmast in a twin gun mount on each side of the ship amidships. They fired a 0.95 kilogram 2.1 lb shell at a muzzle velocity of 950 m s 3,117 ft s . After her 1937 conversion to a minelayer, Zmaj carried 100 mines. A single disassembled de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was stored in the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched. Zmaj was built by Deutsche Werft in Hamburg, Germany. Due to the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, she had to be built as an unarmed auxiliary. Her keel was laid down in 1928 and she was launched on 22 June 1929. While en route to Yugoslavia she had a severe engine fire on 9 September 1929 off Flushing, Netherlands and was forced to return to Hamburg for repairs. These took almost a year and she was accepted by the Royal Yugoslav Navy on 20 August 1930. She was finally commissioned in 1931 after she was armed and finished fitting out in Kotor. Zmaj appears to have been little used in her intended role only her salvage of an upside down Dornier Wal in the Bay of Kotor in 1936 has been confirmed. This may be why she was converted to a minelayer the following year. Following her conversion she made port visits to Piraeus and Istanbul, accompanied by the destroyer Dubrovnik and the submarines Hrabri and Smeli. Zmaj served as the fleet flagship in 1939 and witnessed the new destroyer Ljubljana run aground and sink in January 1940 at the narrow entrance to Sebenico harbor. Shortly before the German invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 Zmaj laid defensive minefields along the Dalmatian Coast and off the main ports. These minefields may have caused the loss of the Yugoslav passenger ships SS Karaore and SS Prestolonaslednik Petar off Zlarin. Zmaj was captured in Split by the Germans on 17 April. Renamed as Drache Dragon by the Germans she was initially used in support of Luftwaffe seaplane units, but was redesignated as an aircraft rescue ship German Flugzeugbergungsschiff on 7 August 1941. Her armament was increased by two 2 centimeter 0.79 in and one 1.5 centimeter 0.59 in anti aircraft guns as well as racks for a dozen depth charges. She was transferred on 27 December to the Aegean and reclassified as a troop transport. Drache was modified at Trieste between April and August 1942 for service as a minelayer. Her existing armament was replaced by two 10.5 centimeter 4.1 in , five 3.7 centimeter 1.5 in and six 2 cm AA guns. She was equipped with four mine rails on her after deck that could accommodate up to 120 mines and another 120 mines could be carried internally. Her crane was replaced by two derricks and the lattice mainmast was plated over and resembled a funnel. A 20 by 5 meter 65 ft 7 in 16 ft 5 in platform was built behind the funnel above the main deck. Drache was recommissioned on 20 August 1942 and she was renamed Schiff 50 on 6 November. She conducted a number of minelaying operations in the Aegean as well as some of the west coast of Greece. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943 she was used to carry troops to reconquer the island of Kos on 23 October Operation Eisbar . On 8 October she was unsuccessfully attacked by the British submarine HMS Unruly although her companion, the German minelayer Bulgaria, was sunk. Drache's most successful operation was a mine barrage laid just east of the islands of Pserimos and Kalymnos to protect German troops during the Battle of Leros. The British destroyer HMS Hurworth and the Greek destroyer Adrias, carrying supplies and reinforcements for the British forces on Leros, ran into this minefield on the evening of 22 October. Adrias had her bow blown off and Hurworth was sunk attempting to come to the aid of Adrias. Adrias, however, was eventually able to make it back to Alexandria. Two nights later the destroyer HMS Eclipse encountered the same minefield while carrying reinforcements to Leros. She hit a mine, broke in two, and sank in five minutes. Drache was also used for shipboard trials with the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri Hummingbird helicopter. She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in JanuaryFebruary 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take off and land. The Kriegsmarine German navy wished to evaluate their potential for anti submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather. The ship was attacked by Allied aircraft several times in 1943 and early 1944, but she was only lightly damaged on two occasions. Nonetheless her anti aircraft armament was augmented during 1944. One quadruple 2 cm Flakvierling 38 mount was installed on each side of the bridge and she carried a total of thirteen 2 cm guns. Her 10.5 cm guns were exchanged for lighter 8.8 centimeter 3.5 in guns to compensate for the increased top weight. However this proved to be insufficient to save Drache when she was attacked by several British Bristol Beaufighters of No. 252 Squadron RAF on the afternoon of 22 September 1944 while anchored in Vathy harbor on the Greek island of Samos. She was set on fire, exploded and sank two hours later eleven of her crew, including the commander Joachim Wunning, died during the attack. She was scrapped in place after the end of the war.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav%20minelayer%20Zmaj
"In number theory, Znam's problem asks which sets of k integers have the property that each integer in the set is a proper divisor of the product of the other integers in the set, plus 1. Znam's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Stefan Znam, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znam problem hereafter. One solution to the improper Znam problem is easily provided for any k the first k terms of Sylvester's sequence have the required property. Sun 1983 showed that there is at least one solution to the proper Znam problem for each k 5. Sun's solution is based on a recurrence similar to that for Sylvester's sequence, but with a different set of initial values. The Znam problem is closely related to Egyptian fractions. It is known that there are only finitely many solutions for any fixed k. It is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znam's problem using only odd numbers, and there remain several other open questions. Znam's problem asks which sets of integers have the property that each integer in the set is a proper divisor of the product of the other integers in the set, plus 1. That is, given k, what sets of integers are there, such that, for each i, ni divides but is not equal to A closely related problem concerns sets of integers in which each integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus the product of the other integers in the set. This problem does not seem to have been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znam problem. Any solution to Znam's problem is also a solution to the improper Znam problem, but not necessarily vice versa. Znam's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Stefan Znam, who suggested it in 1972. Barbeau 1971 had posed the improper Znam problem for k 3, and Mordell 1973 , independently of Znam, found all solutions to the improper problem for k 5. Skula 1975 showed that Znam's problem is unsolvable for k 5, and credited J. Janak with finding the solution 2, 3, 11, 23, 31 for k 5. One solution to k 5 is 2, 3, 7, 47, 395 . A few calculations will show that An interesting near miss for k 4 is the set 2, 3, 7, 43 , formed by taking the first four terms of Sylvester's sequence. It has the property that each integer in the set divides the product of the other integers in the set, plus 1, but the last member of this set is equal to the product of the first three members plus one, rather than being a proper divisor. Thus, it is a solution to the improper Znam problem, but not a solution to Znam's problem as it is usually defined. Any solution to the improper Znam problem is equivalent via division by the product of the xi's to a solution to the equation where y as well as each xi must be an integer, and conversely any such solution corresponds to a solution to the improper Znam problem. However, all known solutions have y 1, so they satisfy the equation That is, they lead to an Egyptian fraction representation of the number one as a sum of unit fractions. Several of the cited papers on Znam's problem study also the solutions to this equation. Brenton Hill 1988 describe an application of the equation in topology, to the classification of singularities on surfaces, and Domaratzki et al. 2005 describe an application to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata. As Janak Skula 1978 showed, the number of solutions for any k is finite, so it makes sense to count the total number of solutions for each k. Brenton and Vasiliu calculated that the number of solutions for small values of k, starting with k 5, forms the sequence Presently, a few solutions are known for k 9 and k 10, but it is unclear how many solutions remain undiscovered for those values of k. However, there are infinitely many solutions if k is not fixed Cao Jing 1998 showed that there are at least 39 solutions for each k 12, improving earlier results proving the existence of fewer solutions Cao, Liu Zhang 1987, Sun Cao 1988 . Sun Cao 1988 conjecture that the number of solutions for each value of k grows monotonically with k. It is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znam's problem using only odd numbers. With one exception, all known solutions start with 2. If all numbers in a solution to Znam's problem or the improper Znam problem are prime, their product is a primary pseudoperfect number Butske, Jaje Mayernik 2000 it is unknown whether infinitely many solutions of this type exist.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zn%C3%A1m%27s%20problem
"Florian Witold Znaniecki 15 January 1882 23 March 1958 was a Polish philosopher and sociologist who taught and wrote in Poland and in the United States. Over the course of his work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America 19181920 , which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism. In Poland, he established the first Polish department of sociology at Adam Mickiewicz University where he worked from 1920 to 1939. His career in the US begun at the University of Chicago 1917 to 1919 and continued at Columbia University 1932 to 1934 and 1939 to 1940 and at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign 1942 to 1950 . He was the 44th President of the American Sociological Association for the year 1954 . Florian Znaniecki was born on 15 January 1882 at Swiatniki, Congress Poland, a state controlled by the Russian Empire to Leon Znaniecki and Amelia, nee Holtz He received early schooling from tutors, then attended secondary schools at Warsaw and Czestochowa. While in secondary school, he was a member of an underground study group, specializing in history, literature and philosophy. His secondary school grades were average at best, and he had to repeat a year of school this was largely due to his extracurricular interest in Polish language study, which was banned under the Russified school program. As a youth, he wrote some poetry, including a drama, Cheops 1903 . A poem of his, Do Prometeusza To Prometheus , was included in a 1900 anthology however, neither he in later life, nor literary critics, judged his poetry outstanding. He entered the Imperial University of Warsaw in 1902, but was soon expelled after taking part in protests against the Russian administration's curtailment of student rights. Threatened with conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, he chose to emigrate and in early 1904 left Warsaw for Switzerland. During that period, he was briefly an editor at a French language literary magazine, Nice Illustree late 1904 early 1905 faked his own death briefly served in the French Foreign Legion in Algeria and worked at a flea market, on a farm, in a traveling circus, and as a librarian at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland. In Switzerland he soon resumed his university studies, first at the University of Geneva 19051907 , then at the University of Zurich 19071908 , eventually transferring to the Sorbonne in Paris, France 19081909 , where he attended lectures by sociologist Emile Durkheim. In 1909, after the death of his supervisor Frederic Rauh, he returned to Poland, where in 1910 he obtained his Ph.D. degree at Jagiellonian University, in Krakow, under a new supervisor, Maurycy Straszewski. That year he also joined the Polish Psychological Society Polskie Towarzystwo Psychologiczne , in which he would be highly active over the next few years, becoming its vice president in 19131914. Much of his early academic work at that time could be classified as philosophy. In 1909, aged 27, he published his first academic paper, Etyka filozoficzna i nauka o wartosciach moralnych Philosophical Ethics and the Science of Moral Values a year later he published Zagadnienie wartosci w filozofii The Question of Values in Philosophy , based on his doctoral dissertation, and a paper, Mysl i rzeczywistosc Mind and Reality . In 1912 he published a new book, Humanizm i Poznanie Humanism and Knowledge , and a paper, Elementy rzeczywistosci praktycznej Elements of Practical Reality . A year later, he published an annotated translation of Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution and a paper, Znaczenie rozwoju swiata i czowieka The Meaning of World and Human Development . The year 1914 saw the publication of his papers, Formy i zasady tworczosci moralnej Forms and Principles of Moral Creativity and Zasada wzglednosci jako podstawa filizofii The Principle of Relativity as a Foundation of Philosophy . His works, published in Polish, were well received by the Polish scholarly community and intelligentsia. Due to his past political activism, he was unable to secure a post at a major university. From 1912 to 1914 he lectured at a novel women's institution of higher education, the Advanced Pedagogical Courses for Women Wyzsze Kursy Pedagogiczne dla Kobiet . During his studies, he had worked at several European institutions dealing with Polish immigrants he would build on his experiences by becoming involved with the Warsaw based Society for the Welfare of Emigres Towarzystwo Opieki nad Wychodzcami , where he worked in 19101914. By 1911 he was the Society's director and 19111912 editor of its journal, Wychodzca Polski The Polish Emigre . Znaniecki became an expert on Polish migration, in 1914 authoring for the government a 500 page report, Wychodztwo Sezonowe Seasonal Migration . A year earlier, in 1913, Znaniecki had met William I. Thomas, an American sociologist who had come to Poland in connection with his research on Polish immigrants in the United States. Thomas and Znaniecki had begun to collaborate, and soon Thomas invited Znaniecki to come to Chicago to continue work with him in the United States. In July 1914, just on the eve of World War I, Znaniecki left Poland to work with Thomas as a research assistant. From 1917 to 1919 Znaniecki also lectured in sociology at the University of Chicago. Their work culminated in co authoring of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America 19181920 , considered a sociology classic. It was his collaboration with Thomas that marked the transition in Znaniecki's career from philosopher to sociologist. Znaniecki stayed with Thomas in Chicago until mid 1919, when he moved to New York, following Thomas, who had lost his job at Chicago due to a spurious scandal. That year Znaniecki published a new book, still mostly philosophical rather than sociological, Cultural Reality. Published in English, it was a synthesis of his philosophical thought. In New York, Thomas and Znaniecki carried on research for the Carnegie Corporation on the process of immigrant Americanization. Znaniecki contributed to Thomas' book, Old World Traits Transplanted, and published an anonymous solicited article on that topic to the February 1920 Atlantic Monthly. Poland had regained independence following World War I, in 1918. In 1919 Znaniecki contacted the newly founded Ministry of Religion and Education, offering to return to Poland if the Ministry could help him secure a chair at a Polish university. He proposed creating a novel Institute of Sociology, but bureaucracy and communication delays resulted in that idea being shelved, and he was offered a philosophy professorship at the newly organized Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. In 1920 Znaniecki returned to the newly established Second Polish Republic, where at Poznan University he soon became Poland's first chair in sociology. He accomplished this by renaming the department, originally Third Philosophical Department , to Department of Sociology and Cultural Philosophy , doing the same for his chair, and establishing a Sociological Seminary. That same year he also founded the Polish Institute of Sociology Polski Instutut Socjologiczny , the fifth oldest sociological institute in Europe. In 1927 his department was officially renamed to department of sociology , and in 1930 the department gained authorization to issue degrees in sociology. In 1930 the Polish Institute of Sociology began publishing the first Polish sociological journal, Przeglad Socjologiczny The Sociological Review , with Znaniecki its chief editor from 1930 to 1939. That year the Institute organized Poland's first academic sociologists' conference. Due to his role as founder of so many of its building blocks, Znaniecki is considered as one of the fathers of sociology in Poland. Keeping in touch with American sociologists, Znaniecki lectured as a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York in 193234 and during the summer of 1939. That summer ended the Polish stage of his career, as the German invasion of Poland and the start of World War II prevented his return to Poland. He was already aboard a ship bound for Poland when his travel was cut short in the United Kingdom. He still briefly considered returning to Poland, where his wife and daughter remained however, faced with the occupation of Poland, he returned to the United States, where his family eventually joined him in 1940. With help from American colleagues, Znaniecki obtained an extension of his appointment at Columbia University through mid 1940. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and in 1942 obtained American citizenship, allowing him to transition from a visiting to a regular professorship. He taught at the University of Illinois until his retirement, deciding not to return to the communist People's Republic of Poland, established in the aftermath of World War II despite the offer of a chair at Poznan University . In 1950 he retired, becoming a professor emeritus. He was 44th President of the American Sociological Association for 1954 . His presidential address, Basic Problems of Contemporary Sociology, was delivered on 8 September 1954 at the Association's annual meeting and was later published in the American Sociological Review. He died on 23 March 1958 in Champaign, Illinois. The cause of death was arteriosclerosis. His funeral took place on 26 March, and he was buried at Roselawn Champaign Cemetery . In 1906 Znaniecki married a fellow Polish student at the University of Geneva, Emilia Szwejkowska. They had a son, poet and writer Juliusz Znaniecki, born 1908. Znaniecki's wife Emilia died in 1915. Next year Znaniecki married Eileen Markley 18861976 . They had one daughter, sociologist Helena Znaniecki Lopata, born 1925. Polish sociologist and historian of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include the founding of sociology in Poland his work in empirical sociology and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches between objectivity and subjectivity between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints and between American and European intellectual traditions. Szacki writes that, while Znaniecki's theoretical contributions were subsequently pushed into the background by Talcott Parsons' functionalism , Znaniecki offered the most ambitious sociological theory known to America before Parsons. Znaniecki's most famous work remains The Polish Peasant in Europe and America 19181920 , co authored with William I. Thomas. His other major works include Wstep do socjologii An Introduction to Sociology, 1922 , The Method of Sociology 1934 , Social Actions 1936 , The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge 1940 and Cultural Sciences 1952 . Znaniecki's contributions to empirical sociology began after, and were influenced by, his collaboration with William I. Thomas. The Polish Peasant in Europe and America 19181920 , a five volume work which he wrote with Thomas, is considered a classic of empirical sociology. It is a study of Polish immigrants to America, based on personal documents. The work became a landmark study of Americanization of how new immigrants to the United States become Americans . This work represents Znaniecki's most valued contribution to empirical sociology. Most of his other works focused on theory, the only other notable exception being Miasto w swiadomosci jego obywateli The City in the Consciousness of its Citizens, 1931 . A key element of Znaniecki's sociological theory is his view of sociology in particular, and of the social sciences in general, as a scientific field uniquely different from the natural sciences. Znaniecki defines sociology as a study of social actions. His recommended methodology was analytic induction analysis of typical case studies, and generalization from them. Znaniecki's theories form a major part of sociology's action theory, and his work is a major part of the foundation of humanistic sociology. Another term connected with Znaniecki's theories is systematic sociology socjologia systematyczna . He sought to create a grand sociological theory, one that would bridge the gap between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches. Znaniecki criticized the widespread definition of sociology as the study of society. In Znaniecki's culturalist perspective, sociology is a study of culture though it is not the study of culture, as Znaniecki recognized that other social sciences also study culture . His definition of sociology has been described as that of a cultural science whose function is to study systems of social interaction based upon patterns of values and norms of behaviour, through the use of the humanistic coefficient , or more simply, the investigation of organized, interdependent interaction among human beings. The part of the culture that sociology focused on was that of social relation or interaction. Znaniecki saw culture as a field separate from nature, but also from individuals' perceptions. The essence of culture is socially constructed objects. He was one of the first sociologists to begin analyzing personal documents such as letters, autobiographies, diaries, and the like. He considered the analysis of such documents an important part of the humanistic coefficient method. Znaniecki saw sociology as an objective, inductive and generalizing science. According to Szacki, Znaniecki viewed sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a methodology similar to that of the natural sciences however, Znaniecki's daughter Helena Znaniecki Lopata, in her introduction to Social Relations and Social Roles, contradicts Szacki, writing that, for Znaniecki, sociology was a science whose subject matter calls for a method different from that of the natural sciences. . In 1934 he formulated the principle of analytic induction, designed to identify universal propositions and causal laws. He contrasted it with enumerative research, which provided mere correlations and could not account for exceptions in statistical relationships. He was also critical of the statistical method, which he did not see as very useful. In addition to the science of sociology, Znaniecki was also deeply interested in the larger field of the sociology of science. He analyzed the social roles of scientists, and the concept of a school of thought. According to Znaniecki, sociology can be divided into the study of four dynamic social systems social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem. The four major forms of cooperative interaction, or four social systems, in growing complexity, were The four category division described above appeared in his 1934 book, The Method of Sociology. By 1958 he had reformulated the division, and was speaking instead of social relations, social roles, social groups, and societies. Znaniecki coined the term humanistic coefficient for a method of social research by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not objectively as an independent observer in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti subjectivist he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values. Znaniecki characterized the world as being caught within two contrary modes of reflection idealism and realism. He proposed a third way, which he called culturalism . His culturalism was one of the founding ideas of modern antipositivist and antinaturalist sociology. The term culturalism was introduced into English in his book, Cultural Reality 1919 , and was translated into Polish as kulturalizm previously Znaniecki had discussed the concept in Polish as humanism humanizm . Znaniecki's work also touched on many other areas of sociology, such as intergroup conflict, urban sociology, and rural sociology. Znaniecki's first academic works, of the 1910s, were more philosophical than sociological in nature beginning in the 1920s, his works were primarily sociological. His Cultural Reality 1919 was a synthesis of his philosophical thought, but the simultaneous publication of his much more popular The Polish Peasant in Europe and America 19181920 associated his name in academic circles primarily with sociology rather than with philosophy. His early works focused on analysis of culture and strongly criticized the principles of sociological naturalism. Szacki notes a puzzling gap in Znaniecki's research while he was well read in, and engaged with, most previous and current theories, he largely ignored the works of some notable sociologists of his time such as Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto and Talcott Parsons. On the other hand, his works engaged closely with those of William I. Thomas, Georg Simmel, Robert E. Park, and Emile Durkheim. His The Method of Sociology first introduced his concept of divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published in the same year 1952 Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles The Unfinished Systematic Sociology 1965 . Roughly half of Znaniecki's published works are in English the rest, in Polish. In English In Polish",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%20Znaniecki

Manga artist Natsumi Ando enjoyed astrology in her childhood and had a fondness for stars and Greek mythology. For File 2, which deals with a mystery in a piano school, Ando researched a local music school. The design for the Libra astral spirit originated from the winner of the Astral Spirit Design Contest many of the design submissions were for the Libra, Pisces, and Cancer spirits. Ando included references to Greek mythology in Zodiac P.I. in the names of the astral spirits. The astral spirit of Virgo, Demeter, takes her name from the goddess of the harvest, while the astral spirit for Capricorn, Parn, is a reference to the god Pan. Astrea, the astral spirit for Libra, is named after the goddess of justice. The twin astral spirits for Gemini take their names from twin brothers Castor and Pollux. The centaur Chiron is alluded to in the name of the astral spirit for Sagittarius. The name of astral spirit for Taurus is a reference to the woman Io. The astral spirit for Pisces and the spirit for Aquarius take their names from the goddess of love and Ganymede, respectively. Other references include stars. Ando named Antares, the astral spirit of Scorpio, and Regulus, the astral spirit of Leo, after the Antares and Regulus stars, respectively. Written and illustrated by Natsumi Ando, Zodiac P.I. appeared as a serial in the monthly manga magazine Nakayoshi from the April 2001 issue to the January 2003 issue. It published the series in four bound volumes from November 6, 2001, to March 4, 2003. In North America, Tokyopop licensed the series for an English language translation.

In his review of the second volume, Anime News Network's Allen Divers described the series as similar to Detective Conan and wrote that despite the predictable endings, the series was potentially enjoyable for readers interested in astrology and mysteries. According to Jason Thompson, author of Manga The Complete Guide, the series worked as light and formulaic entertainment for a young audience, and the artwork proved easy to understand.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac%20P.I.
"The Zodiac settle is a piece of painted furniture designed by the English architect and designer William Burges and made between 1869 and 1871. A wooden settle designed with Zodiac themes, it was made for Burges' rooms at Buckingham Street, and later moved to the drawing room of The Tower House, the home that he designed for himself in Holland Park. Burges desired to fill his home with furniture covered with paintings, both ornaments and subjects it not only did its duty as furniture, but spoke and told a story. At one stage the poet John Betjeman gave the settle to the novelist Evelyn Waugh, and it is now in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery Museum in Bedford. The settle is a wooden bench with a canopy. It is painted and stenciled, with inlaid pieces of glass crystal and vellum. In 1865, Burges wrote, it is almost impossible for us to conceive the effect of a first class piece of medieval sacred furniture covered with burnished gilding engraved and punched into patterns enriched with paintings by an artist like Giotto, and glittering with mosaics of gilt and coloured glass. The only settle that Burges created, its form has been likened to a day bed of the Italian Renaissance. Burges scorned his typical French Gothic influences in his design for the settle, being influenced instead by English Gothic sources as well as the Italian Renaissance. It is decorated with a central painted panel, painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The panel features an enthroned sun, with the Zodiac signs dancing around it. The signs of Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus and Aries dance on the right, and Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are dancing on the left. The planets of the solar system are depicted as musicians on one side of the settle, with Saint Cecilia and another female figure on the other side. It is inscribed in Latin BURGES ARCHITECTUS ME FIERI FECIT ANNO SALUTIS MDCCCLXIX AUTEM ME DEPINCI FECIT APRILIS SALUTIS MDCCCLXX Burges the Architect had me made in the year of salvation 1869 however he had me painted in April of the year of salvation 1870 . The maker of the settle is unknown it is believed to be either Harland and Fisher, who had made earlier pieces of furniture for Burges, or John Walden, who made the guest bedroom furniture for the Tower House. The settle featured in photographs published in 1885, taken in Buckingham Street by Burges's brother in law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. The settle is shown with an embroidered panel and three seat cushions. Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was originally placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House was designed by Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House until his death in 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House. The decoration of the drawing room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother in law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T. H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold. The Tower House was owned by Colonel E. R. B. Graham and his wife from 1933. The English poet John Betjeman, a champion of the architecture of the Victorian Gothic Revival, later befriended the Grahams and Betjeman was given the remaining two year lease on the Tower House and some of the furniture upon Mrs Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman subsequently gave the Zodiac settle as well as the Narcissus washstand and the Philosophy cabinet from Tower House to his friend, the novelist Evelyn Waugh. It is believed Betjeman gave them to Waugh to appease his wife, Penelope, who did not share his appreciation of Gothic Revival painted furniture. The Philosophy cabinet is now in the private collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Narcissus washstand in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery Museum in Bedford. Waugh mentioned the settle in a letter to his daughter Maragret FitzHerbert in July 1965. Waugh wrote that the settle was looking very well between the windows of the morning room . The settle descended through the Waugh family before being acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery Museum in 2011. A temporary export bar was placed on the settle by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest RCEWA . The RCEWA is part of the Arts Council England and advise the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on matters concerning the exporting of objects of national interest. It was subsequently acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery Museum in Bedford after a 480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund NHMF , 190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and 180,000 from the Art Fund.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac%20settle
"Zoe Porphyrogenita Greek life Medieval Greek zo'i c. 978 11 June 1050 reigned as Byzantine Empress from 11 November 1028 until her death in 1050. She ruled alongside her three husbands, her adopted son Michael V, and her sister Theodora. Zoe held actual power with Theodora for only two months between April and June 1042. Zoe was born to Constantine VIII, who was nominal co emperor to his brother Basil II. Basil died when Zoe was 47, leaving the Byzantine throne entirely to her father. As he had no sons, Constantine hoped to continue the dynasty by marrying off one of his daughters. Zoe, aged 50, was married to Romanos Argyros. Zoe and her husband took the throne three days later on her father's death. The marriage was troubled and after five years Romanos III was found dead in his bath. His death has been variously attributed to Zoe, her young lover Michael, or both. They were married on the same day as the murder, and he was crowned emperor on the following day. Seven years later, Zoe was persuaded to adopt her dying husband's nephew, also named Michael. Once Michael V became emperor, he promptly exiled Zoe. Michael V's action sparked a popular revolt which dethroned him and installed Zoe and Theodora as joint empresses. After a two month joint reign Zoe married a former lover who was installed as Constantine IX Monomachos, transferring power to him. Exactly eight years later, Zoe died aged 72. Zoe was Porphyrogenita, born into the purple this was the appellation for a child born in the capital to a reigning emperor. She was the second daughter of Constantine VIII and his wife Helena. Her father became co emperor, at the age of two, in 962. His brother Basil II, the senior co ruler, prevented his nieces from marrying any of the Byzantine nobility, as this would have given their husbands a claim on the imperial throne. As women they were unable to exercise any state authority their only say in this was in choosing, or more likely accepting or not, a husband who would acquire their authority upon marriage. Consequently, Zoe lived a life of virtual obscurity in the imperial gynaeceum women's quarters for many years. As an eligible imperial princess Zoe was considered a possible bride for the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto III, in 996. A second embassy sent in 1001, headed by Arnulf, Archbishop of Milan, was tasked with selecting Ottos bride from among Constantines three daughters. The eldest, Eudocia, was disfigured by smallpox, while the youngest, Theodora, was a very plain girl. Arnulf therefore selected the attractive 23 year old Zoe, to which Basil II agreed. In January 1002 she accompanied Arnulf back to Italy, only to discover when the ship reached Bari that Otto had died, forcing her to return home. When Basil II died, Constantine VIII took the throne. His reign as sole emperor lasted less than three years, from 15 December 1025 to 15 November 1028. Another opportunity for Zoe to marry arose in 1028, when an embassy from the Holy Roman Empire arrived in Constantinople with a proposal for an imperial marriage. Constantine and Zoe rejected the idea out of hand when it was revealed that the intended groom, Henry, the son of Conrad II, was only ten years old. Constantine determined that the ruling house would be continued by one of his daughters being married to an appropriate aristocrat. The first potential match was the distinguished noble Constantine Dalassenos, the former dux of Antioch. The emperor's advisors preferred a weak ruler whom they could control and they persuaded him to reject Dalassenos after he had already been summoned to the capital. Romanos Argyros, the urban prefect of Constantinople, was the next to be considered as a match. Theodora defied her father by refusing to marry Romanos, arguing that he was already married his wife having been forced to become a nun to allow Romanos to marry into the imperial family 465 and that as third cousins they had too close a blood relationship for marriage to occur. Consequently, Constantine VIII chose Zoe to be Romanos's wife. Zoe and Romanos married on 10 November 1028 in the imperial chapel of the palace. Three days later Constantine died and the newly weds were seated on the imperial throne. Spending years in the same restrictive quarters with her sister, Zoe had come to loathe Theodora. Zoe convinced Romanos to appoint one of his own men as the chief of Theodoras household, with orders to spy on her. Shortly afterwards, Theodora was accused of plotting to usurp the throne, first with Presian in 1030, followed by Constantine Diogenes, the governor of Sirmium, in 1031. Zoe accused her of being part of the conspiracy, and Theodora was forcibly confined in the monastery of Petrion. Zoe later visited her sister and forced her to take religious vows. Zoe was obsessed with continuing the Macedonian dynasty. Almost immediately upon marrying Romanos the fifty year old Zoe tried desperately to become pregnant. She used magic charms, amulets, and potions, all without effect. This failure to conceive helped alienate the couple, and soon Romanos refused to share the marriage bed with her. Romanos limited his wife's spending and paid her little attention. Zoe, furious and frustrated, engaged in a number of affairs. Romanos tolerated these and took a mistress himself. In 1033 Zoe became enamoured of a low born servant called Michael. She flaunted her lover openly and spoke about making him emperor. Hearing the rumours, Romanos was concerned and confronted Michael, but he denied the accusations. In early 1034 Romanos became ill and it was widely believed that Zoe and Michael were conspiring to have him poisoned. On 11 April Romanos was found dying in his bath. According to court official and later chronicler Michael Psellus some of his retinue had held his head for a long time beneath the water, attempting at the same time to strangle him . John Scylitzes writes as a simple fact that Romanos was drowned on Michael's orders. Matthew of Edessa's account has Zoe poisoning Romanos. Zoe and Michael were married on the same day that Romanos III died. The next day they summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate at the coronation of the new emperor. Although he initially refused to co operate, the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He proceeded to crown Michael as the new emperor of the Romans, to reign as Michael IV until his death in 1041. Although Zoe believed Michael would prove to be a more devoted husband than Romanos, she was mistaken. Michael IV was concerned about Zoe turning on him the way she had turned on Romanos, so he excluded Zoe from politics by placing all power in the hands of his brother, the eunuch John the Orphanotrophos. Zoe was confined again to the palace gynaeceum, and kept under strict surveillance. The disgruntled empress conspired against John but in vain. By 1041 it was obvious that Michael IV was dying. Eager to ensure that power remained in his hands, John the Eunuch forced Zoe to adopt Michael, the son of his and Michael IV's sister. On 10 December 1041, Michael IV died, refusing to the last to see his wife who begged that she be allowed to visit him one more time, and his nephew Michael V was crowned emperor. Although he had pledged to respect Zoe, Michael V promptly banished her to a monastery on Principus, an island in the Sea of Marmara, on charges of attempted regicide. She was forcibly tonsured and sworn into a religious order. This treatment of the legitimate heir to the Macedonian Dynasty caused a popular uprising in Constantinople. Michael V, desperate to keep his throne, brought Zoe back from Principus and displayed her to the people, but his insistence that he continue to rule alongside her was in vain. On 19 April 1042 the mob dethroned Michael V in support of not only Zoe, but also Theodora. A delegation headed by Patrician Constantine Cabasilas went to the monastery at Petrion to convince Theodora to become co empress alongside her sister. Accustomed to a life of religious contemplation Theodora rejected them and sought sanctuary in the convent chapel. In the event she was carried forcibly back to the capital. At an assembly in Hagia Sophia the people escorted a furious Theodora and proclaimed her empress along with Zoe. After crowning the two empresses the mob stormed the palace, forcing Michael V to escape to a monastery. Zoe immediately assumed power and tried to force Theodora back to her monastery, but the Senate and the people demanded that the sisters should jointly reign. As her first act Theodora was called upon to deal with Michael V. Zoe wanted to pardon and free Michael, but Theodora was clear and adamant. She initially guaranteed Michaels safety, but then ordered him to be blinded and to spend the rest of his life as a monk. Officially Zoe was the senior empress, and her throne was situated slightly in front of Theodora's on all public occasions. In practice Theodora was the driving force behind the joint administration. The sisters proceeded to administer the empire, focusing on curbing the sale of public offices and on the administration of justice. Although contemporary historian Michael Psellus claimed the joint reign was a complete failure, John Scylitzes stated that they were very conscientious in rectifying the abuses of the previous reigns. Theodora and Zoe appeared together at meetings of the Senate and gave public audiences, but it was soon apparent that their joint reign was under strain. Zoe was still jealous of Theodora and had no desire to administer the empire but she would not allow Theodora to conduct public business alone. The court began to split, with factions forming behind each empress. After two months of increasing acrimony, Zoe decided to search for a new husband thereby denying Theodora the opportunity to increase her influence. By the rules of the Orthodox Church her next marriage, her third, was the last she was permitted. Her preference was for Constantine Dalassenos, who had been her father's first choice as her husband back in 1028. He was brought for an audience before the Empress, but during their conversation his independent and forceful manner displeased Zoe, and he was dismissed from her presence. Her next choice was the married Constantine Atroklines, a court official with whom it was rumoured that she had had an affair during the reign of Romanos III. He died under mysterious circumstances a few days before the wedding was to take place, possibly poisoned by his own soon to be ex wife. Zoe then remembered the handsome and urbane Constantine Monomachos, another former lover. The pair were married on 11 June 1042, without the participation of Patriarch Alexios, who refused to officiate over a third marriage for both spouses . On the following day Constantine was formally proclaimed emperor together with Zoe and Theodora. Zoe got more than she bargained for when Constantine decided to bring with him to his new station his long standing mistress Maria Skleraina. Not content with bringing her to court, he insisted that he be allowed to publicly share his life with her, and that she obtain some official recognition. The 64 year old Zoe did not object to sharing her bed and her throne with Skleraina. Skleraina was given the title of sebaste, ranking behind Zoe and Theodora, and was addressed as mistress or empress, like them. At official events Skleraina took position immediately behind the sisters. In the eyes of the public however, Constantine IXs preferential treatment of Skleraina was a scandal, and eventually rumours began to spread that Skleraina was planning to murder Zoe, and possibly Theodora. This led to a popular uprising by the citizens of Constantinople in 1044, which came dangerously close to actually harming Constantine who was participating in a religious procession along the streets of Constantinople. The mob was only quieted by the appearance on a balcony of Zoe and Theodora, who reassured the people that they were not in any danger of assassination. It is said that Zoe was stunningly beautiful, and Michael Psellos in his Chronographia commented that every part of her was firm and in good condition . Zoe recognised her own beauty and its use as a tool of statecraft. Attempting to maximise and prolong its effect she had a variety of creams and treatments prepared in the gynaeceum, and was said to have carried out experiments attempting to improve their efficacy. She operated a cosmetics laboratory in her rooms in the palace, where perfumes and unguents were constantly being prepared. Psellus reports that her face looked youthful into her sixties. Zoe died on 11 June 1050 aged 72.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB%20Porphyrogenita
"Elias Zoghby January 9, 1912 January 16, 2008 was the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Baalbek and a leading advocate of Catholic Orthodox ecumenism. He is best known for his ecumenical interventions during Vatican II and his 1995 Profession of Faith, known as the Zoghby Initiative, which attempted to re establish communion between the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church while maintaining communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Zoghby's views on topics such as CatholicOrthodox double communion and dissolution of marriage were controversial. Critics labeled him the enfant terrible of his church, while supporters lauded him as an energetic visionary who sought to re unite the Eastern Churches. Elias Zoghby was born on January 9, 1912, in Cairo. His mother, Hanne Ishak Yared, was a Melkite Greek Catholic and his father, Abdallah Mikail Zoghby, was an Antiochian Orthodox convert and former Maronite Catholic. The couple had recently emigrated from Lebanon and settled in Cairo's Arb el Guenena neighborhood. The area had a Melkite church nearby which his parents attended. Elias and his siblings were baptized into the Melkite faith and raised in a devout household, attending liturgy daily, reading the bible together as a family and praying the Office every afternoon. Zoghby related in Memoires that he first received a vocational call at age sixteen. With his parent's blessing he left for seminary in the summer of 1928, going to Jerusalem to study with the White Fathers at the Melkite seminary of Saint Anne. He was ordained a priest at Saint Anne Melkite Basilica in Jerusalem on July 20, 1936, following which he was appointed a professor of Arabic Literature and Mathematics at the seminary. He later returned to Cairo as a parish priest. While in Egypt, Zoghby considered the issues of ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. As he began to study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches he came to the opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church. In 1951 he was elevated to archimandrite while serving in Alexandria. While there he was threatened with arrest for preventing the execution of a sentence passed by a Sharia tribunal. On August 27, 1954, he was named auxiliary bishop of Antioch then, on September 2, 1954, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nubia. Zoghby was formally consecrated bishop on November 21, 1954, when he was elevated to Patriarchal Vicar for the See of Alexandria, Cairo and the Sudan. As the leader of the Melkite church in Egypt Zoghby was a vocal proponent of rights for Christians, and opposed the limitations placed on them by that country's Law of Personal Statutes. The Nasser regime imprisoned him on December 20, 1954, for his public opposition to the statutes. Released shortly afterwards, he continued to serve as patriarchal vicar in Egypt. Zoghby was one of the most active eastern Catholic bishops to participate at the Second Vatican Council, where he offered eleven interventions. While some of the interventions were pastoral in nature, a good number were ecumenical, focusing on the Eastern churches and their relationship with Western Christianity. Zoghby's efforts helped shape the formation of Orientalium Ecclesiarum, although, to his disappointment, it did not adequately address the needs of the Eastern Catholic Churches or bridge the gulf between Orthodoxy and Catholicism. While Orientalium Ecclesiarum encouraged Eastern Catholics to uphold their traditions and values, Zoghby felt that it turn a blind eye to true intercommunion communicatio in sacris . Following the Council he opposed the acceptance of a Roman cardinalate by Melkite Patriarch Maximos IV Sayegh, stating that the leader of an Eastern Catholic church should not hold a subordinate Latin rite office. In protest, Zohgby resigned his position as patriarchal vicar of Alexandria. Maximos IV died in 1967 his successor, Maximos V Hakim, was a friend of Zoghby's and a fellow Egyptian. In August 1968 the Melkite Synod elected Zoghby archbishop of Baalbek to replace the recently deceased eparch, Joseph Malouf. Installed as archbishop there on September 9, 1968, he led the small eparchy during the Lebanese Civil War. In 1982 he was kidnapped by pro Iranian terrorists. Zoghby retired on October 24, 1988, at age 76. He remained an active proponent of ecumenism following his retirement, urging the reunification of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and the Antiochian Orthodox Church. He died on January 16, 2008, in Lebanon his funeral was held on January 19 at St. Paul Basilica in Harissa. Zoghby's ecumenical initiatives gained visibility in May 1974 with the exchange of visits between the Melkite Catholic and the Antiochian Orthodox synods, which met simultaneously in Lebanon. During the visit of the Melkite Catholic delegation to the Orthodox synod Zoghby drew attention to the fact that the original causes of separation between the groups had ceased to exist and the way was open for the creation by stages of a real union between the two Churches, without waiting for the union of the Church of Rome and the Orthodox Churches. Afterwards, the churches agreed to form separate commissions for dialogue. Zogby outlined his views on the topic in his book Ecumenical Reflections, which was characterized by Vsevolod, the Orthodox Bishop of Scopelos, as an invitation to ecumenical metanoia ... to recognize that where there is the fundamental common faith, held alike by Catholics and Orthodox, there is no defensible impediment to Eucharistic Communion. While attending Vatican II Zoghby spoke to the Council on September 29, 1965, about the trauma of the innocent spouse in cases of adultery. Zoghby suggested a solution which considers adultery and abandonment as causes for the dissolution of marriage The following month, Melkite Patriarch Maximos IV declared that, while Archbishop Zoghby, like all Fathers of the council, enjoys full freedom to say what he thinks ... speaks only for himself personally. With respect to the heart of the problem, the Church must hold fast to the indissolubility of marriage.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias%20Zoghby
"Samuel Walter Zoldak, nicknamed Sad Sam, December 8, 1918 August 25, 1966 was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball MLB for nine seasons in the American League with the St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, and Philadelphia Athletics. In 250 career games, Zoldak pitched 92913 innings and posted a winloss record of 4353, with 30 complete games, five shutouts, and a 3.54 earned run average ERA . Although an average hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .175 batting average 50 for 286 with just 16 runs and 11 RBI, he was a very good fielding pitcher, posting a .984 fielding percentage with only four errors in 258 total chances. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Zoldak began his professional career in the low level minor leagues, working his way up despite being released from his first team. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1944 and placed him on their major league roster. He debuted on May 23, and spent the next four years as a spot starter, working both as a starting pitcher and relief pitcher. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, and helped lead the team to the 1948 World Series. After two more years with Cleveland, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics, the organization he originally started with, and played two seasons there. After a short minor league stint in 1953, he retired from the game, and died in 1966. Zoldak was born on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised by his mother, and worked at her confectionery shop, both while he was growing up and during the baseball offseason. He attended Eastern District High School, and took up the game of baseball at McCarren Park, as his high school did not have a baseball team. He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also playing some semi professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York. Zoldak was signed by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack before the 1941 season, ending his college baseball career and restarting his professional one. In 1941, Zoldak played for the Selma Cloverleafs and Williamsport Grays, pitching in 12 combined games. The following season, he spent the full year with Williamsport. In 32 games, he won and lost 11 each, and finished the year with an ERA of 2.54 in 177 innings pitched. The following year, he remained in the Eastern League with the Elmira Pioneers due to the Williamsport team choosing not to field a team until the conclusion of World War II. In 36 games for Elmira, Zoldak won 20 games, lost 11, and had a 2.73 ERA in 244 innings pitched. On February 17, 1944, Zoldak was traded along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran to add to their roster, while the Browns wanted the two prospects as they were classified as 4 F, and would be available to the team for the duration of the war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning an ERA of 3.72. The Browns made it to the 1944 World Series, but Zoldak did not see any action. He played in 26 games during the 1945 season, earning a 3 2 record with an ERA of 3.36. In his final appearance of the season on September 29 against the Cleveland Indians, he was given the opportunity to start a game opposite Bob Feller. In a six inning game shortened by rain, Zoldak and the Browns won, 21. Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was reluctant to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, one of which was a complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave him credit for three of the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 911 record, and a career high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946 he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9 10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered 100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter the day of the game. After spending the first two months of the season with the Browns, where he went 24 record in 11 games, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 15, 1948, who added pitcher Bill Kennedy to go with their original offer of 100,000, a move which Bill Veeck called a case of begging for him on our knees. For the Indians, he served both as a relief pitcher and a fifth starting pitcher as he did with the Browns. On August 18, he faced his former team, and threw a complete game shutout, defeating the Browns, 30. A month later, he won two back to back games against the Detroit Tigers, both in extra innings. During his time with the Indians, he went 9 6 with a 2.81 ERA in 23 games, 12 of them starts. He was on the Indians roster for the 1948 World Series and warmed up for all six games in the Indians' bullpen, but was never called upon to pitch he was one of two on the roster who did not see any action in the World Series. Zoldak was moved to a relief role full time for the 1949 Cleveland Indians season due to a lack of depth with the departures of Ed Klieman and Russ Christopher. On July 27, Zoldak managed to hit his only career home run against the New York Yankees off Ed Lopat. However, the game was rained out, and the only home run of his career was erased. In 27 games that season, Zoldak had a 12 record with a 4.25 ERA. Zoldak had struggled in spring training the prior year due to both being out of shape and a lack of pitching control, but was impressive enough in 1950 after losing the weight and regaining his control that manager Lou Boudreau decided to put him in the starting rotation to begin the year. He pitched poorly in his first starts, and was placed back in the bullpen for the rest of the year Indians management considered demoting him to the minor leagues, and would have been sent to the San Diego Padres in May if not for the intervention of Johnny Berardino, who wanted to play on the west coast and agreed to a demotion instead. Zoldak spent the full season with Cleveland, and had a 42 record and a 3.96 ERA in 33 games. As the 1951 season began, Zoldak was part of a three way trade. On April 30, 1951, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics along with Ray Murray, which also involved the Chicago White Sox. Manager Jimmy Dykes brought Zoldak onto the Athletics with the intention of putting him in the starting rotation in place of Lou Brissie, who had been sent to the Indians in the same trade. On July 15, Zoldak pitched a one hitter against the Chicago White Sox in what was called the greatest game of his career, and followed that up with a complete game against the Indians, allowing one run in nearly ten innings of work. In 26 games for the Athletics, 18 of them starts, he had a 610 record and a 3.16 ERA. Before the 1952 season began, manager Dykes planned on giving Zoldak more rest between starts to try and maximize on what he could provide for the team, as he had been growing tired when overused during the season. Zoldak pitched in 16 games in 1952, and had a 06 record and a 4.06 ERA. On February 2, 1953, the Athletics released Zoldak unconditionally, considering him expandable due to the team having 20 pitchers on their spring training roster. He was given a tryout with the Toronto Maple Leafs, but after salary negotiations fell through he signed with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Zoldak pitched briefly for the Rainiers, appearing in two games before being released by the team he retired from the game after his release. After retiring, he became a box office man, working at sporting events as well as shows on Broadway. Zoldak, who never married, died of lung cancer on August 25, 1966, leaving behind his mother and three siblings, and is buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam%20Zoldak
"Stanisaw Zokiewski Polish pronunciation 1547 7 October 1620 was a Polish nobleman of the Lubicz coat of arms, magnate and military commander of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, who took part in many campaigns of the Commonwealth and on its southern and eastern borders. He occupied a number of high ranking posts in the administration of the Commonwealth, including castellan of Lwow from 1590 , voivod of the Kiev Voivodeship and Great Chancellor of the Crown from 1618 . From 1588 he was also a Field Crown Hetman, and in 1613 was promoted to Grand Hetman of the Crown. During his military career he won major battles against Sweden, Muscovy, the Ottoman Empire and the Tatars. Zokiewski's best known victory was against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the battle of Klushino in 1610, in the aftermath of which the Poles seized and occupied Moscow. He died in the 1620 battle of Cecora against the Ottomans, after allegedly refusing to retreat. Already renowned as a military leader, Zokiewski's heroic death further boosted his fame. He is seen as one of the most accomplished military commanders in the history of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Stanisaw Zokiewski was born in the village of Turynka in 1547 to Stanisaw Zokiewski of the Lubicz coat of arms, voivode of Ruthenia, and Zofia Lipska. The exact date of his birth is unknown, and even the year is disputed most sources agree on 1547, although a few suggest 1550. Zokiewski attended a cathedral school in Lwow now Lviv, Ukraine . Unlike many of his peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies on his own and was particularly interested in history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king's secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and on his way back he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs. Zokiewski gained his first military experience under King Stefan Batory during the Danzig rebellion in which he commanded a rota of Polish hussars. He subsequently participated in Batory's Livonian campaign, fighting at Polotsk, Rossony Soko , Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov. Zokiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the Zborowscy. On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski, whose subsequent execution caused much controversy. Zokiewski became notorious for his role in the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585. In 1588, during the War of the Polish Succession between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III, Zokiewski supported Sigismund. Zokiewski commanded the right flank of Commonwealth forces in the battle of Byczyna, during which he received a knee wound that lamed him for the remainder of his life. For his part in the battle he was appointed a Field Crown Hetman, and became the starost of Hrubieszow. Soon after becoming a Hetman, Zokiewski was sent to Ukraine to repel a Tatar invasion. In 1590 he became the castellan of Lwow, but his requests for military reinforcements against the Tatars went unheeded. In 1595 Zokiewski participated in the Moldavian campaign and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Zokiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, which led to a deterioration in Polish Cossack relations. In 1600 Zokiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo. In 1601 Zokiewski operated in the north, in Livonia Inflanty , during the PolishSwedish War. He also took part in the successful siege of Wolmar, and in 1602 the taking of Fellin. That same year he led Polish forces at the battle of Reval, which led to a Swedish capitulation at the siege of Biay Kamien. Zolkiewski became ill near the end of the campaign and had to relinquish command of his forces to Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. In 1606 Zokiewski returned to Ukraine, where he defeated the Tatars at the battle of Udycz. Later that year he decided to support the king during the Zebrzydowski rebellion. His decision was not an obvious one, as his mentor Zamoyski opposed the king. Additionally, Zokiewski was related to the Zebrzydowski family and was sympathetic to some of the rebels' arguments. In the battle of Guzow he commanded the left flank of the royal forces, but his troops took relatively little part in the battle. Unimpressed with Zokiewski's performance, the king did not give him not the Grand Crown Hetmanship that he coveted, although he was appointed to the office of the voivode of Kiev. In the second half of 1609 Zokiewski took part in the PolishMuscovite War also known as the Dymitriads . He supported the election of Wadysaw IV Vasa for the tsar of Russia and the idea of a personal union between the Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia the PolishMuscovite Union . During the De la Gardie Campaign in 1610 he achieved another significant victory against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the battle of Klushino. As a result of his successful campaign Zokiewski seized Moscow and captured the tsar Vasiliy Shuisky and his brothers, Ivan Shuisky and Dmitry Shuisky. Zygmunt rejected Zokiewski's political plan however, which would have required Wadysaw to convert to Orthodoxy. Zokiewski began to write his memoirs after his return from Muscovy. The Poczatek i progres wojny moskiewskiej The beginning and Progress of the Muscovy War , published in 1612, is a critique of Zygmunt's policies. In 1612 he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisaw Koniecpolski, future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project O chowaniu zonierza kwarcianego On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers , in which he argued for the need to raise a larger army to deal with the Tatars and the Cossacks. The project was however not approved by the parliament. Zokiewski's popularity waned in the latter years of his career. He was accused of not supporting Samuel Korecki during the battle of Sasowy Rog in 1616, of signing the Treaty of Jaruga Busza in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the Ottoman Empire and of failing to stop the Tatars at the battle of Orynin in 1618. But in 1618 he finally received his coveted buawa of the Grand Crown Hetman, and shortly afterwards the office of Grand Crown Chancellor. He was thus for a brief period the most powerful individual in the Commonwealth after the king, a position he reached not through wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation. Despite being more than 70 years old, Zokiewski continued in active service as a military commander until the very end. He died on 7 October 1620, during the Commonwealth's retreat after the battle of Cecora against the Turks, during the PolishOttoman War 16201621 which marked the end of the Moldavian campaigns. The battle comprised several engagements, in which Polish forces were routed. During the last rout Zolkiewski was killed according to an anecdote he refused to retreat, preferring to stay with the rear guard till the very end. Before his death he received the blessing of his confessor, Father Szymon Wybierski Wybierek, Wyberek of the Society of Jesus, who stood fearlessly at his side 7 October . see painting Battle of Cecora 1620 by Walery Eljasz Radzikowski After the battle Zokiewski's corpse was desecrated by the removal of its head and sent to Constantinople as a trophy of war. His widow bought his body from the Turks and ransomed their son, who had been captured during the battle. Zokiewski was buried in St Lawrence Church in Zokiew now Zhovkva, Ukraine , the town he enlarged and where he built the Zokiew Castle. Zokiewski's heroic death portrayed in several works of art by contemporaries such as Teofil Szemberg and Stanisaw Witkowski boosted his reputation and guaranteed him a place among the pantheon of the most famous of Polish military commanders. In the years following his death he was mentioned in the works of writers such as Stefan Zeromski, Jozef Szujski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Maria Konopnicka. Up to the present day, the story of his death is the best remembered aspect of his life, with a number of sources discussing the legend of Zokiewski . A monument was built at the site of Zokiewski's death now in Berezovca in Ocnita District, Moldova by his son Jan, in 1621. It is inscribed with a motto from Horace Quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori How sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country . The monument was destroyed in 1868, rebuilt in 1912, and renovated in 2003. It is a venue for events organized by the Polish minority in Moldova. In 1903 a statue of Zokiewski was built in Zokiew, but it was demolished in 1939 by Soviet troops in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Poland. In modern Poland Zokiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Zokwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators. Zokiewski was married to Regina Herbutowna they had a son, Jan , and two daughters, Katarzyna and Zofia. Over the course of his career Zokiewski amassed a large fortune, and acquired lands near Boryspil, Brody, Vinnytsia and Zokiew. His annual income of more than 100,000 zotys made him one of the wealthiest magnates in the Commonwealth. Zokiewski's assets were eventually inherited by Jakub Sobieski, whose son Jan became a Polish king and another renowned Polish commander.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw%20%C5%BB%C3%B3%C5%82kiewski
"Zoloti Vorota Ukrainian i is the 29th station of the Kiev Metro system that serves the Ukrainian capital Kiev. The station was opened as part of the first segment of the Syretsko Pecherska Line on 31 December 1989. It serves as a transfer station to the Teatralna station of the Sviatoshynsko Brovarska Line. It is located near the city's Golden Gate, from which the station takes its name. The original design plans for the station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due to the efforts of the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine was a part of the secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991. The Zoloti Vorota features 80 distinct mosaic pieces and images depicting the history of Kievan Rus'. In 2011, the station's mosaics were listed as newly discovered objects of cultural heritage by the city's Department of Cultural Heritage. The station is regarded as one of the most impressive metro stations in Europe, being placed on a list compiled by The Daily Telegraph in 2013. The initial plans for the future Syretsko Pecherska Line called for a transfer station named Kominternivska to connect with the Sviatoshynsko Brovarska Line at Universytet station. However, the short central hall at Universytet was inadequate for the high volume of passengers that a transfer station would be subject to, thus the station's future location was moved a few city blocks to coincide with a newly proposed station of the Sviatoshynsko Brovarska Line. This new station, called Teatralna, would be located in between the Khreshchatyk and Universytet stations, and would serve as a transfer to the future Zoloti Vorota station. Although the Kominternivska station was never built, some of its architectural designs were preserved and used in the creation of the Teatralna station. Construction for the Syretsko Pecherska Line, the Kiev Metro system's third line, began on 23 February 1983. It had a projected date of completion in 1986, although the line's opening was delayed until the end of 1989 due to the economic state of the Soviet Union at the time. The line's first segment was officially opened on 31 December 1989, and consisted of three stations Zoloti VorotaPalats SportuMechnikova named Klovska today . Since its entrance is located on a hillside, two separate escalator tunnels had to be created, connected by an underground station vestibule. The upper tunnel is 35 m 115 ft long, while the lower tunnel is 56 m 184 ft long. The vestibule was built in the same way as with other stations of the Kiev Metro system it was first completed at ground level, and then lowered to its final location underground. The vestibule is a 20 m 66 ft tall monolithic dome with an approximately similar diameter. The installation began in November 1987 and was completed by 1988, lowered at a pace of half a meter a day. Since the construction took place in water saturated soils, over 200 frozen wells had to be formed so it could be lowered to its proper location. In addition, over 250 m2 300 sq yd of rock had to be removed to make way for the vestibule. After it was finally installed, construction work began on the lower escalator tunnel. Due to a difficult hydrogeology, the tunnel was not completed by the station's grand opening and until 1 May 1990, it could only be reached with a transfer from the Teatralna station. For several years, the Zoloti Vorota station served as the line's northern terminus. Continued construction extended the line northwards to the Lukianivska station. In between the two stations, the Lvivska Brama station was built during the late 1990s however, it has not been completed to this day. From an engineering standpoint, Zoloti Vorota was built as a deep column station, at a depth of 96.5 m 317 ft underground. It consists of three distinct vaulted halls, featuring one central hall, and two side platform halls, each separated by a row of columns. The central hall is connected to the only above ground vestibule through two escalator tunnels, separated by an underground vestibule, which was needed because of the depth at which the station is located. Its design and formation is nearly similar to the Maidan Nezalezhnosti station of the system's ObolonskoTeremkivska Line. The station's original plans were designed by a team of Moscow architects from Metrogiprotrans their design was strictly utilitarian, architecturally similar to the other metro stations of that period. However, due to the socio economic changes taking place in the country at the time, the original design was scrapped because it was considered too weak for one of the city's main metro stations in a historically significant location. The city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov approached Vadym Zhezherin to create a new design for the station. Zhezherin enlisted the help of his father, Borys in completing the design. Vadym previously worked on the reconstruction of the city's Leo Tolstoy Square and similarly named metro station, while his father, who was awarded the title of Distinguished Architect of Ukraine, was responsible for the reconstruction of the nearby National Opera House. They were supported by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design was based on the form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. The station is illuminated by two tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, although they are significantly smaller than the main chandeliers. The redesign also called for a gold smalt covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor. The Zoloti Vorota station features a number of distinct mosaic decorations, which were completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. There are a total of 80 large mosaic pieces they run in a clockwise direction around the station, depicting the history of Kievan Rus. The two artists, accompanied by the station's lead architect Vadym Zhezherin, concluded that the station should be decorated with mosaic pieces of historical significance of the period leading up to the Mongol invasion of Rus'. Korin completed the mosaics in either ends of the station and the large ceiling arches, while Fedko was completed the unique images relating to Kievan Rus' and the smaller arches in between each of the station's pillars. Four large mosaic panels are installed on either ends of the station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side that leads to the exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, at the very end of the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating , which is translated as Glory to Ukraine. A large portion of the station's mosaics depict the various Grand Princes of Kievan Rus', of which 27 are depicted. The mosaic pieces themselves incorporate the princes' years of reigning and their names The station also has nine mosaics depicting various other important personalities of the Kievan Rus' era featuring Anthony, Theodosius, Anne, Hilarion, Agapetus, Alypius, Nestor the Chronicler, Petro Mylonig, and Sylvester. Eight of the mosaic pieces depict Kiev's ancient Rus' churches including the Church of the Tithes, the Saint Sophia Cathedral, Iryninska Church, St. Michael's Golden Domed Cathedral, Church of the Saviour at Berestove, Dormition Cathedral, Church of the Mother of God Pyrohoshchya, and the St. Cyril's Monastery. Lastly, there are 32 mosaic pieces featuring simargls, which are mythical creatures in East Slavic mythology, often depicted as a winged lion or dog. Mosaic depicting Yaropolk II of Kiev with one of the chandeliers seen in the background An example of the mosaics covering the station's white marble covered pillars Mosaic depicting the Church of the Tithes, which was destroyed by the Bolsheviks in 1928 Mosaics depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel, flanked by two mythical creatures The Zoloti Vorota station has only two street entrances, one of which is located on Volodymyrska Street, and the other on Zoloti Vorota Passage. Each of the entrances are connected by a single vestibule in the city center near the Golden Gate, and Ukraine's National Opera building. As of 2008 , the Zoloti Vorota station has a daily ridership of 20,000. The station itself is operational every day from 05 39 to 00 06, while the transfer tunnel which connects Zoloti Vorota to Teatralna is open from 05 45 to 00 32. The station features six escalators, with the upper and lower vestibules both having two operating escalators, with an additional backup escalator. The commute from Zoloti Vorota to the line's terminus at Syrets takes approximately 9 minutes and 5 seconds, while it takes 30 minutes and 55 seconds to commute to the Chervony Khutir terminus. The train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 213 minutes in either direction. The morning's first eastbound train departs from the station at 05 48, while the westbound train departs at 06 01. The evening's last eastbound departs at 00 15, while the westbound train departs at 00 30. The entire Kiev Metro system uses the same methods of payment for transit via each station plastic tokens, temporary paper contactless cards, and reloadable plastic contactless cards. In June 2015, the station was outfitted with Paypass functionality, a contactless payment service from MasterCard. It is one of seventeen strategic stations of the metro system to use this technology, making Kiev the fifth rapid transit system in the world to incorporate this technology.

"Zoltan Hungarian pronunciation c. 880 or 903 c. 950 , also Zolta, is mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum as the third Grand Prince of the Hungarians who succeeded his father Arpad around 907. Although modern historians tend to deny this report on his reign, because other chronicles do not list him among the Hungarian rulers, there is consensus that even if Zoltan never ascended the throne, all monarchs ruling in Hungary from the House of Arpad after around 955 were descended from him. Modern historians' main source of Zoltan's life is the Gesta Hungarorum, a late 12th century chronicle whose writer is now known as Anonymous. According to this source, Zoltan was the only son of Arpad, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. In contrast, the nearly contemporary Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus writes that Zaltas was Arpad's fourth son. Zoltan's name seemingly derived from the Arabian sultan title with Turkic mediation, but modern scholars have not unanimously accepted this etymology. According to Anonymous, Zoltan was born after 903, during his father's second campaign against Menumorut. The latter was one of the many local rulers who are solely mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum among the opponents of the Hungarians during their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. In the Gesta Hungarorum's narration, Menumorot was forced to surrender and to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltan in 904 or 905. When Menumorut died, Zoltan inherited his father in law's duchy east of the river Tisza, which Anonymous claims was inhabited by the peoples that are called Kozar . Anonymous also states that Zoltan, still a minor, succeeded his father who died around 907. Zoltan, in turn, later abdicated in favour of his son Taksony and died in the third year of his son's reign . And his son Zolta succeeded , who was similar to his father in character but dissimilar in appearance. Prince Zolta was a little lisping and pale, with soft, blonde hair, of middling stature a warlike duke, brave in spirit, merciful to his subjects, sweet of speech, but covetous of power, whom all the leading men and warriors of Hungary loved marvelously. Some time later, when Zolta was thirteen, all the leading men of the realm by their common counsel and of their equal wish appointed rectors of the kingdom beneath the prince to mend through the guidance of customary law the conflicts and lawsuits of litigants. Nowadays historians reject most details of Zoltan's life presented by Anonymous. For instance, the Hungarian historian Gyula Kristo says that Zoltan was born around 880 instead of around 903. His Romanian colleague Alexandru Madgearu likewise writes that either Zoltan was born many years earlier than 903 or his marriage must have happened years after 904. Zoltan's father in law's identity is also debated. Medievalist Pal Engel says that Menumorut is one of the imaginary figures invented by Anonymous in order to describe the conquering Hungarians' heroic wars against them. Historian Charles R. Bowlus writes that he was a Moravian ruler whose daughter's marriage with Zoltan symbolized the end of Great Moravia . Medievalist Tudor Salagean also says that Menumorut was a real person, the ruler of a one time duchy inhabited by Romanians, Slavs and many other peoples at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Anonymous's statement that Zoltan succeeded his father as grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltan ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged. For instance, historian Sandor L. Toth writes that Zoltan, being the youngest among Arpad's four sons, could hardly precede his elder brothers in the line of succession. Kristo also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltan's rule, implying that Anonymous only inserted Zoltan into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Arpad descended from him. The following is a family tree presenting Zoltan's closest known relatives Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars. All later grand princes and kings of Hungary descended from Taksony.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n%20of%20Hungary
"Zombi 2 is a 1979 Italian zombie film directed by Lucio Fulci. It was adapted from an original screenplay by Dardano Sacchetti to serve as a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 , which was released in Italy with the title Zombi. It stars Tisa Farrow, Ian McCulloch, and Richard Johnson, and features a score by frequent Fulci collaborator Fabio Frizzi. Frizzi's score has been released independently of the film, and he has performed it live on tour. The film tells the story of a Caribbean island cursed by voodoo, whose dead residents rise as zombies to attack the living. A scientist's daughter journeys to the island after her father's boat turns up abandoned in New York City. Intended by its writer as a return to classic zombie tales , Zombi 2 was filmed in Italy, with further location shooting in New York and Santo Domingo. Produced on a small budget of 410 million, the film earned several times its production costs back in international gross. It attracted controversy upon its release in the United Kingdom, where it became listed as a video nasty . An abandoned sailboat drifts into New York Harbor and is boarded by harbor patrol officers. One officer bleeds to death after a zombie bites him on the jugular vein. The zombie then goes to attack the other but is shot and falls overboard. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles Tisa Farrow , who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West Ian McCulloch , and the pair follows her father's trail to the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull Al Cliver and Susan Barrett Auretta Gay , who are sailing around the area and agree to take them to Matul. On Matul, Dr. David Menard Richard Johnson has been running the hospital whilst researching voodoo rites. His wife Paola Olga Karlatos wishes to leave the island, but Menard insists on staying until he understands the phenomenon. At the hospital, patients are dying of a strange illness, and the islanders are frightened by reports of people rising from the dead. Menard begins shooting corpses to stop them from reanimating. Paola is attacked at home by a zombie and dragged out through a smashed door to her death, her eye impaled on splintered wood. On the boat, Susan dives underwater and encounters a Tiger Shark. Taking shelter behind a reef, she is attacked by an underwater zombie. She escapes as the shark and the zombie attack each other. Brian shoots at the shark, and the shark rams the boat, damaging it. Eventually, the group arrives at Matul, firing distress flares to request assistance. Menard goes to meet them, leaving his nurse Stefania D'Amario to supervise the mass burial of dead patients. He tells Anne that her father is deada victim of the troubles on the islandand asks the group to check on Paola. They are horrified to discover her corpse being devoured by zombies. The four escape in Menard's jeep, but the vehicle crashes when Brian swerves to avoid a zombie, and in the process injures Peter's ankle. Making their way back to the hospital on foot, the group stops at a clearing which is actually a Conquistador graveyard. Anne and Peter are attacked by corpses rising from the earth. Brian rescues them, but Susan is killed after a zombie bites into and tears out her throat. The trio returns to the hospital, resolving to defend themselves against the zombie horde. Setting up barricades and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. The three encounter a zombified Susan, who then bites Brian on the arm and is shot by Peter before the three escape to the boat and leave the island. At sea, Brian succumbs to the virus and dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in the cabin as proof of what has happened on Matul. His reanimated corpse begins banging on the door as Peter and Anne listen to a radio report that the New York Harbor incident has escalated into an epidemic as zombies advance on the Brooklyn Bridge and walk into the city. Ian McCulloch on his co star Richard Johnson Zombi 2 serves as a sequel to Zombi, a re edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved successful upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as he did not feel he would be the right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino. Fulci claimed to not having knowledge of the film's title including 2 as a way to tie in with Dawn , and was very displeased with his inability to protest the film's distributors. Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti had already worked with Fulci on Sette note in nero. Sacchetti has since stated that his initial script for Zombi 2originally written under the title Nightmare Islandhad been influenced by The Island of Doctor Moreau and had been intended to return to classic zombie tales such as I Walked with a Zombie, The Walking Dead or Voodoo Island. Sacchetti began work on this script in July 1978, before it was optioned by Angelis' company Variety Films that December and re tooled as Zombi 2. Lead star McCulloch was cast primarily on the success in Italy of the 1975 BBC television series Survivors, which had impressed producer Ugo Tucci. Production occurred during June and July 1979. Filming took place in Latina, Italy, as well as in New York City and Santo Domingo. Several of the actors' contracts had specified being provided with trailers for the duration of production however, none were present when filming started and only Johnson was able to convince the producers to provide one. McCulloch and Johnson had known each other for many years by the time they collaborated on Zombi 2, having first met while they were members of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with the younger McCulloch coming to idolise Johnson's work. The underwater scene featuring a shark attack was devised by Ugo Tucci it was shot without Fulci's approval by Giannetto De Rossi in Isla Mujeres, with the zombie portrayed by a local shark trainer. Composer Fabio Frizzi on collaborating with Fulci The score to Zombi 2 was composed by Fabio Frizzi, who frequently scored Fulci's works, including Sette note in nero, I quattro dell'apocalisse and Sella d'argento previously. Zombi 2 marked the first time the two had worked together on a straight horror movie as opposed to their previous spaghetti western and giallo thriller work Frizzi would go on to compose for many more horror films with and without Fulci. Frizzi's work on Zombi 2particularly Seq. 6 , the sequence composed for the eye gouging scenewas inspired by the melody of The Beatles' 1967 song A Day in the Life . Elsewhere in the score, Frizzi included Caribbean musical cues, which he noted were intended to pleasantly deceive the audience. A medley of the score was later included as part of Frizzi's 2013 Fulci 2 Frizzi live tour, including the 2014 live album release Fulci 2 Frizzi Live at Union Chapel. The score itself was released on vinyl by Death Waltz Records in 2015, with new artwork by Tom Beauvais. All tracks are written by Fabio Frizzi. Zombi 2 was first released on 25 August 1979 in Italy, before being released in English speaking markets in 1980. The film would go on to gross over 3,000,000,000 worldwide, significantly higher than its 410,000,000 budget. Zombi 2 has also been released under the titles Sanguella, The Island of the Living Dead, Zombie Flesh Eaters, Zombie, Zombie The Dead Walk Among Us, Gli Ultimi Zombi, Woodoo, L'Enfer de Zombies, Zombie 2 The Dead Are Among Us and Nightmare Island. Upon its release in the United Kingdom on 2 January 1980, the British Board of Film Classification required a total of one minute and forty six seconds of material to be cut in order to obtain an X rating its most recent home release on 1 August 2005 passed for an 18 rating with no cuts required. However, the 1980 release found itself classified as a video nasty , having been considered a breach of the Obscene Publications Act. This classification, and the de facto ban it involved, has subsequently been used for publicity when advertising future home releases. Zombi 2 has been released several times on home video, beginning with a 1981 VHS version by VIPCO following the theatrical cuts directed by the BBFC. VIPCO produced an uncut release, marketed as the strong uncut version , on VHS the following year this is the release which was widely confiscated as a video nasty . Further VHS releases followed in 1991 and 1994, with the latter being edited for widescreen viewing. The film was first released on DVD by VIPCO in 2004, with minor cuts, and uncut by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2005. Other DVD releases include a 2004 version by Cornerstone Media, and a 2012 DVD and Blu ray version by Arrow Films. Zombi 2 grossed higher in the domestic Italian box office than its predecessor, leading to future sequelsFulci began directing Zombi 3 before illness forced him to hand over the reins to Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso, the latter of whom would also direct Zombi 4. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Make up at the 8th Saturn Awards in 1981. In a contemporary review, Tom Milne reviewed an 89 minute English language dub in the Monthly Film Bulletin and compared the film to Dawn of the Dead. While noting that the cast was competent and the film featured sometimes effective make up work , Milne opined that the film lacks for all weaknesses of Romero's filmeven a tenth of the minatory charge harboured by Zombies. The review noted that the censorship trimmed a promisingly gruesome sequence with a corpse undergoing an autopsy. In Italy, La Stampa described the film as pedestrian , as well finding it hard to bear Olga Karlatos' character's death scene. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40 based on 25 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 5.11 10. Its consensus reads Zombi 2 is an absurdly graphic zombie movie legendary for some gory scenes and nothing in between . In a 2012 review for The Guardian, Phelim O'Neill described the film as the ultimate undead movie , praising its commitment to gory scenes and convincing effects. O'Neill felt that the film stood the passage of time well, and explained that this was because it delivers, plain and simple . He also highlighted Frizzi's work on the score, and summed the film up as a real influence on what followed . Anne Billson, writing for The Daily Telegraph in 2013, included Zombi 2 in her list of the top ten zombie films, describing its opening scenes as sublimely creepy and the eye gouging scene as memorably nasty . Writing for the Daily Mirror, James Kloda praised Fulci's directing, finding that he consistently made evocative use of particular shots to accentuate the film's action or horror. Kloda felt that the film can often blind with its shock violence but is well worth the look . Writing for AllMovie, Robert Firsching described Zombi 2 as a relatively well made shocker which led to the zombie gore film becoming the dominant motif of 1980s Italian horror . Firsching rated the film three stars out of five. Empire's Kim Newman awarded the film two stars out of five, chalking up much of its video nasty reputation to the eye gouging scene, comparing this unfavourably to similar material in 1929's Un Chien Andalou. Newman did compliment several sequences as interesting, particularly one underwater scene depicting a zombie attacking a shark, but found that overall the film did not keep up the pace or plausability sufficiently .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombi%202
"Chamaerops antillarum Desc. Coccothrinax anomala Becc. Oothrinax anomala Becc. O.F.Cook Zombia antillarum var. gonzalezii J.Jimenez Alm. Zombia antillarum, commonly known as the zombie palm, is a species of palm tree and the only member of the genus Zombia. It is endemic to the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles. Usually found in dry, hilly areas of northern and southern Haiti and the northwest of the Dominican Republic, Z. antillarum is a relatively short fan palm with clustered stems and a very distinctive appearance caused by its persistent spiny leaf sheaths. Threatened by habitat destruction in Haiti, Z. antillarum is a popular ornamental species due to its distinctive appearance, low maintenance requirements and salt tolerance. Zombia antillarum is a small palm which grows in dense, multi stemmed clumps with stems up to 3 metres 10 ft tall and 5 centimetres 2 in in diameter. Individuals bear nine to 12 fan shaped or palmate leaves which are greyish white on the lower surface. The leaf sheaths remain attached to the stem after the leaf drops off. The intervening tissue gradually degrades, and the woody vascular tissue splits, forming the spines which are characteristic of the species. The inflorescence, which is shorter than the leaves, bears bisexual flowers with 912 stamens and a single carpel. Fruit are white in colour although orange fruited individuals are also known to exist , oblong or pear shaped, 1.52 cm 0.60.8 in in diameter and bear a single seed. The flowers and fruit are borne among the leaves due to the fact that the inflorescences are shorter than the leaves. Trees can produce 5000 seeds per year, predominantly in July and August. The species is believed to be wind pollinated. Zombia is a monotypic genusit includes only one species, Z. antillarum. The earliest description of the species is found in the work of French physician and botanist Michel Etienne Descourtilz. In 1821 he placed it in the genus Chamaerops as C. antillarum. Italian naturalist Odoardo Beccari independently described the species in 1908, placing it in the genus Coccothrinax as C. anomala . Recognising that it was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus, American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey erected the genus Zombia in 1931 to accommodate the species that Descourtilz had described. This generated the combination Z. antillarum. In selecting a name for the genus, Bailey noted that.mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin 1em 0 padding 0 40px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height 1.5em text align left padding left 1.6em margin top 0 it would be preferable if this endemic palm could bear a Latin name indicative of its nativity rather than an exotic binomial of no relation with its country and the people . In 1941, another American botanist, Orator F. Cook, moved Beccari's C. anomala to a new genus, Oothrinax. This generated a fourth combination, O. anomala. Since Descourtilz's description pre dates that of Beccari, Zombia antillarum which is based on Descourtilz's description has priority over Oothrinax anomala. In addition, Cook's name is invalid, since it was never formally described. In the first edition of Genera Palmarum 1987 , Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus in subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Corypheae and subtribe Thrinacinae using Harold E. Moore's 1973 classification of the palm family. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses showed that the Old World and New World members of the Thrinacinae were not closely related. As a result, Zombia and related genera were places in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. Within this tribe, Zombia appears to be most closely related to the genera Coccothrinax and Hemithrinax, and the species Thrinax morrisii, with the remainder of the genus Thrinax being a sister taxon to this group. Because of this, T. morrisii was moved to a new genus, Leucothrinax. In 1960, Dominican botanist Jose de Jesus Jimenez Almonte described a variety of Z. antillarum, which was distinguished from the typical variety by its smaller, pear shaped fruits with a dirty yellow colour. He named this variety Z. antillarum var. gonzalezii. More recent workers have not considered this form distinctive enough to maintain it as a distinct variety. Trithrinax Itaya Sabinaria Chelyocarpus Cryosophila Schippia Thrinax Leucothrinax Hemithrinax Zombia Coccothrinax Angela Cano and collaborators concluded that the ancestors of the Cryosophileae and its sister taxon, the tribe Sabaleae probably evolved in North America during the late Cretaceous and dispersed to South America by the Eocene before re invading North and Central America during the Oligocene. They concluded that it was more probable that the ancestors of Zombia colonised the Caribbean from North or Central America rather than from South America. Zombia antillarum is called the Zombie palm or Zombi palm by horticulturists. Orator F. Cook coined the name Haitian cactus palm due to the spiny appearance of its trunk. In Haiti, it is usually known as latanye zombi latanier zombi in French the zombie fan palm , or latanye pikan, latanier piquant in French, the spiny fan palm . It is also called latanier savanne or latanier marron. Latanye or latanier is a common term for fan palms in Haiti, so these names savanna fan palm and wild fan palm are not specific to this species they are also used for several species of Coccothrinax. In the Dominican Republic, the species is called guanito or guanillo. These are diminutives of guano, which is used for several species of Coccothrinax and Thrinax. In his 1821 description of the species, Descourtilz used the name latanier epineux. Zombia antillarum is endemic to the island of Hispaniola. In northern Haiti is grows along the tributaries of the Trois Rivieres between Gros Morne and Port de Paix, while in the south, it is found along the eastern edge of the Massif de la Hotte, between Miragoane, Fond des Negres and Fond des Blancs. The species also occurs in northwestern parts of the Dominican Republic, between Dajabon, Jarabacoa, the Sierra de Yamasa, Puerto Plata and Gaspar Hernandez. It grows in dry, hilly regions at low elevation, usually on slopes and ridges, but is generally absent from valley bottoms. In the Dominican Republic, it is found from sea level up to 450 metres 1,480 ft above sea level. Zombia antillarum is associated with serpentine soils, but is also found on calcareous soils. In Haiti, Z. antillarum grows in association with a variety of other palms, including Coccothrinax argentea, Bactris plumeriana, Roystonea borinquena, Sabal causiarum and S. domingensis. In the Dominican Republic, it grows in association with Pinus occidentalis, Calyptronoma rivalis, R. borinquena, S. domingensis, Copernicia berteroana and C. argentea. Although listed as not threatened in the 2006 IUCN Red List, a 2007 review of the status of West Indian palms classified Zombia antillarum as vulnerable based on a projected loss of 10 of the population over the next century. In Haiti, the species is threatened by habitat destruction when land is cleared for agriculture. Seedlings can also be destroyed when browsed by livestock. The plant is a popular ornamental, and is valued for its unusual appearance, low maintenance requirements, small stature and salt tolerance. It is recommended for low maintenance landscaping in South Florida. Leaves of Z. antillarum are used to weave hats, make brooms and the seeds, which have a protein content of 2.84.9 , are used to feed pigs. South of Sabaneta in the Dominican Republic, the petioles are reportedly used to mix manioc flour for making cassava bread. In 1821, Michel Etienne Descourtilz reported that the wood was used for snuff boxes and tobacco cases, that the kernel of the seed was used to treat scurvy, and that the sap had been used by Carib Amerindians for its powerful properties . Fabienne Boncy Taylor and Joel C. Timyan explored the connection between the zombie palm and beliefs about zombies. They found that oil extracted from the seeds has been described as a sense activator by one ethnographic source and can be used to awaken a zombie, and that a dwelling with thatch made from the leaves of the plant could prevent zombies from being used to spy on its occupants. Other sources, however, were reportedly unaware of this these uses. Taylor and Timyan concluded that we were able to find a link, albeit weak, between the name Zombia and Haitian culture, even though we could not verify that this species is typically associated with zombies .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombia
"Zombiepowder. Japanese , Hepburn Zonbi Pauda is the first serialized action manga written and illustrated by Tite Kubo. Zombiepowder. was published in Japan in 1999 by Shueisha, who printed it in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine for 27 chapters before cancelling it. The series was collected into four paperback volumes, released the following year. Zombiepowder. is distributed in North America by Viz Media, who licensed it in 2005. Although critical reception in the United States was largely mediocre, the series achieved moderate commercial success in the western market due to the prominence its author had by that point achieved for his second manga series, Bleach. Zombiepowder. follows a teenaged boy named Elwood Shepherd, who joins with mysterious criminals Gamma Akutabi and C.T. Smith in their search for the Rings of the Dead. These rings are a group of legendary artifacts with the power to resurrect the dead and grant immortality to anyone who collects 12 of them. The series has a Weird West setting which mixes a background of sparsely populated frontier settlements and gunslinger aesthetics with modern conveniences, occult magic, supernatural martial arts, and mad science. The trio travel from town to town in this world, fighting other criminals for possession of the Rings of the Dead. The protagonists obtain three of the rings in the course of the story, but due to the series' cancellation, the eventual success or failure of their quest is unknown. The series was a commercial failure in Japan but has been successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action. Zombiepowder. is set in a western themed environment with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow's manga series, Trigun. The most prominent characters in the series are powder hunters, individuals who seek the titular zombie powder. The zombie powder is a life giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force, grant them immortality, and even raise people from the dead. Zombie powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead. These rings are dangerous magical artifacts that, individually, devour the life force of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose. This stolen life energy is converted into the zombie powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the Dead are brought together. The story begins with young pickpocket John Elwood Shepherd befriending powder hunter Gamma Akutabi after a botched attempt to rob him. Gamma is a highly wanted criminal who possesses one Ring of the Dead. Another member of the local gang for which Elwood works sees the two together and assumes that Elwood is harboring the criminal in hopes of turning him in for his substantial bounty. The gang attacks Elwood's home, and Gamma comes to the rescue, but not before Elwood's sister, Sheryl, is slain by the gang's leader. Following the gang attack, Elwood decides to accompany Gamma in his powder hunting in hopes of resurrecting Sheryl. After leaving Elwood's hometown, the pair meet up with Gamma's long time partner C.T. Smith, another wanted powder hunter. Smith has infiltrated the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which has found a Ring of the Dead. The three challenge the gang's leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays Calder using his mastery of the fictional sword art karin zanjutsu, a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of the Dead, concluding the first arc and volume of the series. The remaining three volumes concern themselves with the battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years in the body of a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before they can do so, however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Balmunk's henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats with the help of a berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs, swearing revenge upon Gamma. After rescuing Emilio, Gamma arranges to have the Ring of the Dead removed from his body by an old friend, mad scientist Nazna Gemini. The characters are brought to Gemini's lab by Angelle Cooney, a young girl with the power of teleportation. Once there, Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolfina. Due to the series' early cancellation, Zombiepowder. is ended without a solid conclusion. The final chapter shows Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolfina behind as they depart the Gemini Laboratory, whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio. It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith, stay with Wolfina and Emilio, or become a powder hunter in his own right. According to Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. originated as an idea for a samurai manga which would have been titled Samurai Drive. This initial conception of the story had very little in common with the end product, as it did not feature western elements or the titular zombie powder. It did star a version of Gamma, however, who still bore an over sized sword and bounty, and featured scifi technologies. With respect to the premise of Zombiepowder., the author stated that the theme was fighting, and a world where the hope for resurrection lay not in god, but obtaining a mysterious substance. Tite Kubo did not comment on his influences for the series, but critic Theron Martin believed its tone, setting, and style drew heavily on the cyberpunk manga Battle Angel Alita, the dark fantasy manga Berserk, and fellow sci fi western manga Trigun, and A.E. Sparrow of IGN noted the obligatory genre influence of martial arts anime Dragon Ball Z. The series also borrows terminology from the music industry, referring to each chapter as a track, the bonus omake content in each volume as B Sides, and naming primary character Elwood after a record label founder. Zombiepowder. began serialization in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump on August 2, 1999, and ran a brief 27 chapters before being canceled on February 28, 2000. According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo was in a state of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it, and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombiepowder., and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor's comments rather than trusting his own ideas. Other than Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. had five credited staff, though their exact roles in its production were never specified. The series was collected into four volumes, published in 2000 in Japan. Zombiepowder. was licensed for English distribution by Viz Media in 2005, following the success of Tite Kubo's second manga series, Bleach. The first English volume was released in the United States in September 2006, and the last was released in June 2007. A French language edition began publication through Tonkam in 2013. The Viz Media releases preserve the Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering was criticized for being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding a gun to his own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 24 also each contain a one shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons to further appeal to Zombiepowder.'s primary English speaking audience of Bleach fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts. Zombiepowder. sold modestly in Japan, but has been commercially successful in the United States. The second volume placed in the top 100 graphic novels for Christmas 2006. Theron Martin of Anime News Network believed the series could have achieved some success in the United States without the Bleach connection due to the American market's larger appetite for series which focus on violent action, but that the series was heavily buoyed by Bleach's international popularity, and primarily imported for an audience of Kubo completists . Critical reception of Zombiepowder. as a whole mostly deemed it mediocre and average. Two reviews from Anime News Network ranked it as a C, it received a C review from MangaCast, a Den of Geek review gave it 3 5 stars, and an IGN review concluded it was no better or worse that many other shonen titles with not much to separate it from the massive stock of shonen series that are similar to it. Jason Thompson included it in a list of mediocre shonen action titles whose cliched nature and ripped off character designs left them interesting only to readers unacquainted with the tropes of the genre. The universal criticism in these reviews is that the series as a whole lacks originality, with most mentioning that it reads very much like the author's first effort it is, and would therefore appeal mostly to fans of the author. While he echoed most individual criticisms of the English language reviewers, a divergent conclusion was reached by Russian critic Alexander Gorban of Animemaniacs Magazine Online, who believes that Zombiepowder.'s fundamentals were all strong, and that the failure of the series in Japan was instead due to Tite Kubo's overreach in publishing a series in the highly competitive Weekly Shonen Jump at such a young age. Had the freshman author been serialized in a less prominent magazine, asserts Gorban, Zombiepowder. would have been allowed longer to establish itself and could have developed into a series at least as good as Bleach. Reception for individual elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed sufficient for the needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen just for the sake of coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes. Of all the elements of the series, Zombiepowder.'s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was the entire sum and substance of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap The theme is fighting. Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read, and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a great shonen tale , but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.'s wall to wall action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombiepowder.
"ZombiU known as Zombi on platforms other than the Wii U is a first person survival horror video game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and published by Ubisoft. It was released for the Wii U as one of its launch games in November 2012. In the game, the player assumes control of a human survivor amid a 2012 zombie apocalypse. Featuring a permadeath system, it uses the Wii U GamePad extensively to scan the environment and maintain the survivor's inventory. ZombiU was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2015 as Zombi. The port, handled by Straight Right, adds new melee weapons and removes the multiplayer feature. Ubisoft was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for its gaming console, Wii U. Originally envisioned as a spin off of the Raving Rabbids franchise and a fast paced first person shooter, Killer Freaks from Outer Space with small, agile monsters , the game was retooled as ZombiU after the development team realized that the Wii U GamePad was suitable for slower paced games. Many of the game's features, including the GamePad feature and the permadeath feature, went through several iterations. Among other video games, ZombiU was influenced by Resident Evil, Condemned Criminal Origins and Peter Jackson's King Kong. London was chosen as the game's setting because of its blend of modern and medieval architecture and its rich history. Ubisoft Bucharest led development of the game's multiplayer portion. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with the game's emphasis on survival horror, atmosphere, and the permadeath system praised. Critics had mixed opinions about gameplay, multiplayer, story and use of the GamePad. Technical problems, such as glitches and load times, were criticized. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, prompting it to turn another Wii U exclusive, Rayman Legends, into a multiplatform game. A prototype for a sequel was developed, but was canceled when the game failed financially. In ZombiU, a first person survival horror game set in London, the player is a survivor of a zombie apocalypse. They are contacted by the Prepper, a mysterious figure who tasks them to maintain his safe house in order to be properly prepared for survival in this new destroyed London, all while the survivor seeks out a cure for the infection at the behest of Dr. Knight, a scientist doctor stationed at Buckingham Palace. The player has a number of ways to deal with enemies, and can confront the zombies with firearms, land mines, and Molotov cocktails. They can use an unbreakable cricket bat, which does less damage than other weapons. There are several types of zombies, including those which explode, are armored, or spill corrosive fluid. The zombies are sensitive to light, and are attracted to a player who is using a flashlight or flare. Sound produced by firearms will also attract nearby enemies to a player, who can push them away with their weapon. The player can also use stealth to avoid being noticed by enemies. Exploration is encouraged in the game. By exploring the game's world, players can find beds which are save points and routes leading them back to their safe houses. New weapons, ammunition, and scarce items can be collected by searching areas or dead bodies. These items include food and medkits which restore health , plywood scraps used to barricade doors , and weapon parts which can be used in the safe house to upgrade weapons . As players discover new items during the game, previously inaccessible areas can be entered. These items are stored in the player character's inventory known as a bug out bag or a cache in the safe house. If the player's character is killed by a zombie which can occur with one bite , the character will permanently die and the player will then assume the role of another survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill to reclaim their inventory. If Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters may also appear as zombies carrying the items they collected. A player can also place symbolic clues and hints, visible to other players, on walls. In addition to the normal difficulty mode, ZombiU has a Chicken mode, which lowers the game's difficulty, for new and inexperienced players and a survival mode where the game ends when the player's original character dies. The game's controls make extensive use of the Wii U GamePad. During normal play, the touchscreen manages player inventory and displays a mini map of the immediate area indicating the locations of the player and nearby enemies . The touchscreen is also used for context sensitive actions such as executions, escaping from enemies, and hacking combination locks. The GamePad's gyroscope, which allows the controller to sense its rotation and tilt in three dimensional space, is also used. While viewing the touchscreen, a player can move the controller to scan different areas to find items. While performing these actions, the television's perspective switches to a fixed third person view of the player character and the surrounding area. The player is vulnerable to attack in this state, and must watch the GamePad's touchscreen and the television screen in to avoid harm. The Wii U camera allows players to import a face, which will be zombified , into the game. ZombiU has three multiplayer modes. In Time Attack mode, players must kill as many zombies as they can in a limited time. In survival mode, players stay alive as long as possible with a limited supply of resources. The results of these two modes will be posted on the game's online leaderboard. The third mode, King of Zombies, is an offline asymmetrical multiplayer mode. A player, using the Wii U Pro Controller, plays a human survivor who must navigate a map to obtain all capture points. Another player, known as King Boris and using the Wii U GamePad with a top down perspective, must deploy a maximum of 10 zombies to halt the players' progress and capture a flag. A progression system is present, in which the Pro Controller player and the GamePad player unlock more powerful weapons and different types of zombies. Four hundred years ago, scientist John Dee made what was known as the Black Prophecy. The Prepper an ex army, no nonsense man prepares for the coming apocalypse, and a secret society known as the Ravens of Dee researches Dee's predictions to stop them from taking place. In November 2012, the Black Prophecy begins to be realized in the form of an outbreak of zombies in London. After the outbreak the player character is led to the Prepper's bunker, where he receives weapons, a bug out bag and the Prepper Pad, a device with a built in scanner and radar. The Prepper, a Raven of Dee, left the organization due to a difference in interpreting Dee's prophecy. According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that he was talking about something worse. The player goes underground while scavenging at Buckingham Palace and is contacted by Dr. Knight, a physician for the Royal Family who is trying to find a cure. He orders the player to find diaries and notes left by Dee in exchange for scanner upgrades and a virucide, a chemical capable of killing those infected. This is done without the Prepper's knowledge, who believes that a cure is impossible. After leaving the palace the player is contacted by Sondra, who leads him to the remnants of the Ravens of Dee and tries to escape with the player in a helicopter on the Tower of London. A supernatural force drives a flock of ravens into the propeller, making the helicopter crash. The player returns to the Prepper's bunker, and Sondra promises to save them. In the bunker, the generator is running out of fuel and the Prepper tells the player to get petrol from a man named Vikram. The player finds Vikram, who has gone mad he and his young child tell the player to go to a local nursery to get antibiotics for his wife. Despite the Prepper's protests who thinks the player should raid the petrol station , he goes to the nursery the staff and children have been eaten by a nurse, who became a ghost like monster capable of teleportation. The player returns with the antibiotics to find that Vikram has become a zombie and eaten his family, forcing the player to kill him. On the way back to the bunker with the petrol, the player receives a distress signal from a young girl that she and her family are barricaded in St. George's Church. Although the Prepper correctly insists it is a trap, the player goes to rescue her. The player is kidnapped by Boris the self proclaimed King of Zombies and his gang, who force survivors to fight off waves of zombies in the church's courtyard. Boris' lights, microphone, and music attract a horde of zombies, and he and his gang are eaten whilst the player escapes. The player has enough upgrades to collect Dee's remaining letters for Dr. Knight, who believes that he can now make a Panacea. He returns to the safe house, where Knight informs him that the Panacea is not a cure but a vaccine. The Prepper expresses profound disappointment in the player as he returns to Buckingham Palace. Knight has left his bunker for the queen's quarters to access data on a USB key. The player makes his way through the palace, discovering that Knight has been killed and turned into a zombie. The player uses Knight's eye to bypass a retinal scanner and collect the USB key. They run back to the Tower of London as the RAF is about to firebomb London and Sondra tries to keep her promise to rescue the player. This enrages The Prepper, who orders the player to leave the safe house and vows to outlive the Ravens of Dee. After the player leaves, the Prepper who has been using survivors to stock his food supplies finds a new lackey to do his bidding. The player reaches Sondra and leaves London as the RAF the prophecy's Black Angels destroy the city. ZombiU was developed by Ubisoft Montpellier with an 80 person team Ubisoft Bucharest provided additional assistance. The game's development paralleled that of Rayman Legends, another Montpellier project. It was produced by Guillaume Brunier, with Gabrielle Shrager its director and lead writer Brunier and Shrager had collaborated on the development of From Dust. The team was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for their Wii U platform. unreliable source The team developmed the game using the proprietary LyN game engine. Since the hardware design was incomplete, the team made a number of prototypical games and decided that the new title would extensively utilize the Wii U GamePad. Originally conceived as a tie in for Raving Rabbids, ZombiU was described as an experiment by Montpellier in adapting the Rabbids franchise for a more hardcore audience. According to Guillaume, the monsters were based on the Rabbids because some people found the sound generated by the Rabbids annoying in the game, players can trash and destroy them. The association with Rabbids was eliminated by Ubisoft during development, since they thought that turning Rabbids into monsters did not suit the Raving Rabbids franchise. Announced at E3 2011 as Killer Freaks from Outer Space, the arcade first person shooter had players with extravagant weapons killing small monsters. Although reaction to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean Karl Tupin Bron, the team was saddened by the fact that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted by the results of the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U. The team chose London as ZombiU's setting because the city hosted the 2012 Olympics, and its dark history including Jack the Ripper matched the game. Although the zombie theme originated in the US, the UK has a blend of modern and medieval architecture which contributes to the game's dark tone. London's proximity to the French developer also allowed the team to research the city. According to writer Antony Johnston, the game features environments from a lavish palace to decaying ruins to reflect the contrast of modern London . London allowed the development team to use Beefeaters, royal guards and a cricket bat inspired by Shaun of the Dead. The cricket bat was the only melee weapon in the game's original Wii U version. After realizing that some players used the bat almost exclusively while playing the game, Shrager regretted not adding more melee weapons and thought that the players deserved a more varied experience. The Wii U GamePad was described as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive such as using a torch to scare off enemies the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first to third person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock pick feature when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door . To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad since the GamePad is a real world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface. ZombiU was designed as a realistic zombie game. Fear was the game's core emotion and it should be played slowly, similar to some classic horror games. According to game director Jean Phillipe Caro, players will do badly if they try to play it as a fast paced action shooter like Call of Duty and ignore the GamePad. A prominent game mechanic is the permadeath system, intended to increase its tension. With the system, the game featured several survivors instead of a hero character. Its narrative was designed to rely on environmental storytelling rather than cutscenes, and players would understand the story through the game experience. The team introduced a persistent level design, in which when players continue playing after their initial survivor is killed. Action by the previous survivor will still affect the game's world previously killed zombies will not re spawn. The permadeath system was debated, with concerns about loading times and backtracking. To ensure that the game's narrative would continue after a player controlled character died, the survivors were not voiced to avoid narrative dissonance this made the player, not the survivors, the protagonist. Although Shrager was relieved when the central character was dropped, writing the game was the toughest challenge she had ever faced in games. Since survivors can die anywhere in the game, linking the story became difficult. The team introduced the Prepper, an important character who communicates with the survivors by radio to link them and advance the narrative. During development, the permadeath concept was nearly removed. ZombiU producer Guillaume Brunier, on its permadeath feature A core team goal was a game which was difficult but fair, inspired by difficult games such as Dark Souls and Demon's Souls. The permadeath system ensured that players are often challenged, since every zombie can be a deadly threat. It fit the game's survival theme, giving players an incentive to continue. The game was designed for players to learn by experience, slowly improving their skill. The Metroid franchise inspired ZombiU's structure, enabling players to backtrack Left 4 Dead inspired enemy placement, and Condemned Criminal Origins influenced the game's first person perspective. Its content was inspired by Capcom's Resident Evil and zombie comics, films and books such as Dead Set and Night of the Living Dead London. ZombiU's offline multiplayer mode was developed by Ubisoft Bucharest. Conceived during early development, it was kept when the core game was reiterated its asymmetrical experience made the developer believe in the Wii U's potential, and was the demo Ubisoft showed the public during E3 2011. A cooperative multiplayer mode and online play were planned by the developer, but were removed due to time constraints. Cris Velasco was the game's composer. By the time Velasco began composing its music, ZombiU was playable its audio director sent him game footage to help him understand the type of music needed. He spent 10 days composing the music, and assembled a string quintet of two violins, a viola, and two cellos to record it. Known as the Apocalypse Ensemble, it played rawer sound which makes the soundtrack menacing. ZombiU was introduced during Ubisoft's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. A webcomic, written by Johnston and illustrated by Kev Crossley, was published on November 12 to promote the game. The 14 page comic, Z 14, was the game's prequel and linked ZombiU to the initial zombie outbreak. ZombiU was released on November 18, 2012 as the Wii U launch game. At release, European players could only purchase the game from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. due to a Nintendo imposed restriction. According to Nintendo of Europe, a German law required that games with mature content be played only at night. After negotiations with the German entertainment software self regulating organization, the restriction was lifted in March 2013. A Wii U package with the game was released on February 13, 2013. In addition to the Wii U, its accessories and ZombiU, the package contained a downloadable copy of Nintendo Land and ZombiU artwork and developer commentary. Ubisoft executive Tony Key said that although the game was designed for the Wii U, the company might bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right who had developed Mass Effect 3's Wii U version , it was released on August 18, 2015. The game is similar to the original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. The shovel has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second a nailed bat inflicts more damage, has a higher critical hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU's flashlight can switch to a wider, further reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. The flashlight must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016. ZombiU received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, with scores ranging from 4 10 given by GameSpot to 9.2 10 awarded by Official Nintendo Magazine. Although Montpellier was initially disappointed by some of the critical reviews, the studio was pleased with the game's overall reception. Jim Sterling of Destructoid wrote that ZombiU's zombies were intimidating by comparison with other zombie games. Sterling called it an oppressive experience, since players were diverted by the GamePad while the game continued in real time. This was echoed by Rich Stanton of Eurogamer, who thought that the system made the game experience scarier. According to Stanton, it was one of the few zombie titles which lived up to the phrase survival horror . Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar agreed, saying that ZombiU in on the 'survival' part of the 'survival horror' genre better than any release in recent memory . Patrick Klepek of Giant Bomb wrote that the game had some very scary moments, which players who liked survival horror would enjoy. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq praised its atmosphere, which he compared favourably with Condemned Criminal Origins. Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com agreed, calling its atmosphere authentic and rich . However, Schilling found the later stages of the game disappointing as the game become less frightening with the introduction of more powerful weapons. Sterling wrote that the permadeath system makes the game feel scarier, saying that the emotional impact on players is more significant than the typical game over screen the former player character could be considered a mute monument to player failure. According to Klepek, seeing a player character becomes a zombie was depressing and soul crushing . Arthur Gies of Polygon wrote that the system helped create an overwhelming sense of fear and risk , and made him play the game in a more careful, tactical manner. Stanton wrote that the system often leads to fraught backpack hunts , since players must retrieve their items from the previous player character if they die, the items would be lost forever. According to Stanton, the system makes the game's items more meaningful and backtracking more fun. Greg Miller of IGN found the game paradoxically cool and nonsensical. Sterling called the plot typical , writing that it was a basic backstory to complement the game's survival theme. Miller agreed, saying that ZombiU did not require a strong narrative. Stanton found the game's narrative not particularly engaging, but the environmental storytelling was skillfully done . Turi found its concept interesting, but was disappointed with the lack of a central character and the game's excessive backtracking. Cooper called the story light , but too complicated by the end he was dissatisfied with the lack of interesting characters. Gies appreciated the game world's development, praising Ubisoft for creating a believable setting however, he and Schilling were disappointed by the story's supernatural elements. Sterling wrote that there was too little enemy variety, which made the game's combat repetitive. He also criticized its map design, saying that in his 11 hour experience with the game, he could not find his way to objectives for at least two hours. Turi called the game's map confusing, agreeing with Sterling that players would easily get lost. He criticized the game's melee weapon as unsatisfying to use, comparing it unfavorably to Dead Island and Left 4 Dead 2. According to Turi, the melee combat shortcomings were highlighted by the game's shortage of ammunition. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot and Miller shared similar concerns, calling the melee combat repetitive. According to McGee, the game's simplistic mission design and puzzle offer little variety. Stanton wrote that although the game's combat was simple, it developed into something special since players needed to choose their weapons wisely. Cooper found several flaws in the systems, such as characters not acknowledging the death of a previous player character and forcing players to replay some game segments. Klepek found the gunplay to be mediocre, but thematically correct. Sterling found the use of the Wii U GamePad hit and miss , stating that the scanning and radar functions are enjoyable. He noted that he was annoyed by the lock picking and barricading minigames, which required players to press the touchscreen rapidly. According to Sterling, the latter two functions were pointless filler. Stanton praised the scanning system for immersing players in the game. Turi found the two screen experience a noble effort, but was dissatisfied with its controls. According to McGee, the GamePad adds little to the game and some of its functions are better handled with a controller. Klepek called most of GamePad features well implemented with the exception of the gyroscope controls. Mitchell wrote that the GamePad enhanced the overall gameplay, but disliked the screen taping minigame in certain GamePad features. Sterling compared its graphics to a Wii title and noted technical flaws, including glitches and slow loading times. He and Stanton thought that some of the game's assets were used excessively. Turi severely criticized the game's lighting system, saying that it looked blurry even given its nighttime setting. Miller also noted the game's sub par texture, and was disappointed by its lack of visual appeal. Turi and Gies noted the difficulty of dragging items with the GamePad, but Gies thought it added tension to the game. Sterling called the multiplayer mode King of Zombie being fun to play playing as King Boris was more enjoyable than playing a zombie survivor. Turi echoed him, noting that a player should only play as a human survivor with a Pro Controller playing with the nunchuck was unbearable . McGee enjoyed this mode more than the single player campaign for its action. Cooper liked the mode, but felt that the lack of online multiplayer limited its longevity. Klepek also liked the mode's concept but called the two player mode a bit limited and not sufficiently enjoyable, a sentiment shared by Mitchell. Schilling thought the mode offered only brief entertainment and was an afterthought . The game's Zombi version also received mixed reviews, according to Metacritic. Christopher Livingston of PC Gamer noted that the PC version had many glitches and occasionally crashed. Shabana Arif of GamesRadar found the system unrefined and repetitive, even with new melee weapons. Disappointed with the lack of enhancement of the original game's graphics, the limited 30 frames per second and the GamePad transition to other home consoles, she called the package a wasted opportunity. James Orry of VideoGamer.com also criticized the lack of visual upgrading and overall improvement and the exclusion of the multiplayer mode, but found the game an excellent entry in the survival horror genre . ZombiU was the 17th bestselling game in the UK in its first week of release, the bestselling third party Wii U launch title. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, and a sequel which would have had cooperative multiplayer and levels with multiple paths was cancelled. ZombiU helped shape the asynchronous gameplay of Ubisoft's 2014 game, Watch Dogs its disappointing sales prompted Ubisoft to turn Rayman Legends an announced 2013 Wii U exclusive into a multi platform game to reach a larger audience.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZombiU
"Zond 5 Russian 5, lit. 'Probe 5' was a spacecraft of the Soviet Zond program. In September 1968 it became the second spaceship to travel to and circle the Moon, and the first to return safely to Earth. Zond 5 carried the first terrestrial organisms to the vicinity of the Moon, including two tortoises, fruit fly eggs, and plants. The tortoises underwent biological changes during the flight, but it was concluded that the changes were primarily due to starvation and that they were little affected by space travel. The Zond spacecraft was a version of the Soyuz 7K L1 crewed lunar flyby spacecraft. It was launched by a Proton K carrier rocket with a Block D upper stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar flyby. Out of the first four circumlunar missions launched by the Soviet Union there was one partial success, Zond 4, and three failures. After Zond 4's mission in March 1968, a follow up, Zond 1968A, was launched on 23 April. The launch failed when an erroneous abort command shut down the Proton rocket's second stage. The escape rocket fired and pulled the descent module to safety. In July, Zond 1968B was being prepared for launch when the Block D second stage rocket exploded on the launchpad, killing three people, but leaving the Proton first stage booster rocket and the spacecraft itself with only minor damage. The Zond 5 mission was originally planned to fly cosmonauts around the Moon, but the failures of Zond 1968A and Zond 1968B led the Soviets to send an uncrewed mission instead, from fear of the negative propaganda of an unsuccessful crewed flight. Two Russian tortoises Agrionemys horsfieldii were included in the biological payload, weighing 0.340.4 kilograms 0.750.88 lb each pre flight. Soviet scientists chose tortoises since they were easy to tightly secure. There were also two tortoises used as control specimens and four more in a vivarium. Twelve days before launch, the two space bound tortoises were secured in the vehicle and deprived of food and water the control tortoises were similarly deprived. The food deprivation was a part of pathomorphological and histochemical experiments. The biological payload also included fruit fly eggs, cells of wheat, barley, pea, pine, carrots and tomatoes, specimens of the wildflower species Tradescantia paludosa, three strains of the single celled green algae Chlorella, and one strain of lysogenic bacteria. The purpose of sending a variety of terrestrial lifeforms was to test the effect of cosmic radiation on them. The Russian Academy of Sciences stated that a mannequin equipped with radiation sensors occupied the pilot's seat. Kazan Optical and Mechanical Plant had developed the AFA BA 40 imager, which was installed on the spacecraft, giving it the ability to image the Earth. Zond 5 also contained proton detectors. Zond 5 could transmit some of its data back to ground stations, although data stored onboard and collected after return to Earth has less noise. Zond 5 launched on 14 September 1968 at 9 42.10 UTC, from Site 81 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The thrust of the third stage rocket was terminated at 160 kilometres 99 mi , which was the start of a 251 second coast. Block D, the upper stage rocket, ignited and burned for 108 seconds, placing the spacecraft into a parking orbit of 191 by 219 kilometres 119 mi 136 mi . Fifty six minutes into the parking orbit the Block D fired a final time for the trans lunar injection. After this maneuver, the launch was announced to the world. Mission Control discovered a problem with Zond 5's attitude and traced the cause to a contaminated star tracker. Heat caused some of the interior coating to outgas, which delayed an attitude correction on the way to the Moon. The maneuver was performed 325,000 kilometres 202,000 mi from Earth using the Sun and the Earth as reference points. On 18 September, the spacecraft flew around the Moon, although it did not orbit it. The closest distance was 1,950 kilometres 1,210 mi . On the way back from the Moon, another star tracker failed. The spacecraft also erroneously switched off the guided reentry system. The Soviet government had deployed eight ships to the Indian Ocean prior to the launch, as a precaution in case the spacecraft could not reach Soviet territory only three of them had rescue helicopters on board. On 21 September, the reentry capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere. The primary landing zone was in Kazakhstan, but instead Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean and was recovered by the Soviet vessels Borovichy and Vasiliy Golovin . It landed at 3238' latitude and 6533' longitude, 105 kilometres 65 mi from the nearest Soviet naval ship. The landing occurred at night, which impaired recovery efforts. Zond 5 became the first spacecraft to circle the Moon and return to Earth. The entire journey took 6 days, 18 hours and 24 minutes. Although the ballistic reentry would probably have been lethal for human occupants, it did not appear to affect the biological specimens, which were alive when the descent module was opened four days after landing. USS McMorris shadowed the Soviet recovery ships, collecting intelligence, but left shortly after the spacecraft was brought on board the Soviet ship. High quality photographs of the Earth, the first photos of their kind, were taken at a distance of 90,000 kilometres 56,000 mi . British astronomer Bernard Lovell, considered to be Britain's top space expert, said that the Zond 5 mission showed that the Soviets were ahead in the Space Race. The British Interplanetary Society believed that the USSR would be able to send cosmonauts around the Moon within a matter of months. In October 1968, sources in the U.S. claimed the mission was not as successful as the Soviets advertised. The mission had been intended to fly closer to the Moon, and its actual distance did not allow for useful lunar photography. They also said that the angle at which the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere was too steep for a cosmonaut to have survived. The sources indicated that the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean when the planned location was in Soviet territory, which was a factor in the recovery taking ten hours. The official Soviet news agency, TASS, announced in November 1968 that the flight had carried living animals. The tortoises were dissected on 11 October after fasting for 39 days. The flying tortoises, identified as No. 22 and No. 37, had lost 10 of their body weight during the trip, but showed no loss of appetite. The control tortoises lost 5 of their weight. Comparison of analyses of blood from the space travelling tortoises and the control specimens revealed no differences. Another analysis showed the flying tortoises had elevated iron and glycogen levels in their liver and that the flight also affected the internal structures of their spleens. The authors concluded that the changes in the flight tortoises were primarily due to starvation, with the space travel having little effect. In November 1968, it was announced that the spacecraft was planned as a precursor to a crewed lunar spacecraft. The Soviets made this announcement a month before the planned Apollo 8 flight, in an attempt to show they were close to being able to carry out a crewed trip to the Moon. The Zond 5 return capsule is on display at the RKK Energiya museum, located in Moscow Oblast, Russia.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zond%205
"Zoo Station is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the opening track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, a record on which the group reinvented themselves musically by incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music. As the album's opening track, Zoo Station introduces the band's new sound, delivering industrial influenced percussion and several layers of distorted guitars and vocals. Similarly, the lyrics suggest the group's new intents and anticipations. The introduction, featuring an explosion of percussion and a descending glissando for a guitar hook, was meant to make the listener think the album was mistakenly not U2's latest record or that their music player was broken. The song's lyrics were inspired by a surrealistic story about Berlin from World War II that lead vocalist Bono heard, when overnight bombing damaged the zoo and allowed animals to escape and wander around the city's rubble. Bono was also inspired by the city's Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station and used it as a metaphor for a reuniting Germany. Zoo Station was performed as the opening song at every concert on U2's Zoo TV Tour. The song received positive reviews from critics, many of whom analysed the song as a representation of the band's reinvention. Following difficult recording sessions at Hansa Studios in Berlin in late 1990, U2 undertook the second phase of the recording sessions for Achtung Baby in Dublin. They struggled with the song Lady With the Spinning Head later released as a B side , but three separate tracks, Zoo Station , Ultraviolet Light My Way and The Fly , were derived from it. The band ultimately decided to take Zoo Station in a more industrial direction than Lady With the Spinning Head . Zoo Station came together near the end of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums. The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, Let's just try something that's gonna put me in a completely different place . After they distorted his voice to make it sound as if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different emotional feel . Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording. With Achtung Baby, the group sought to recover some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they had dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers. U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for Zoo Station were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered around the next morning while people were sifting through the rubble. Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as Zoo station , previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway. He compared the song to the station, saying it was written as an opening track, the beasts breaking out of their cages , and was interested in using the zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from the subway station representing Europe at a crossroads. During recording, Eno created several prototype mixes of the song. The Edge recalled how these different mixes assisted the band in creating the final version of the track. One of these early versions was later released under the title Bottoms Watashitachi No Ookina Yume as a bonus track on the UK and Japanese promotional releases of the experimental 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1 by Passengers, a side project by U2 and Eno, as well as a B side on some versions of the Miss Sarajevo single. Bottoms Watashitachi No Ookina Yume is an instrumental track and was described by The Edge as a crazy mix. He added 'Bottoms' was done in Japan, and we just built on that mix. Sometimes you can end up with something completely distinctive. Although Zoo Station was not released as a single, it was included on a 12 inch promotional recording to promote U2's Zoo TV Tour in North America, along with studio and remix versions of Lady with the Spinning Head . As the first track on an album that was a major reinvention for the band, Zoo Station was an introduction to U2's new sound. The song features layers of distorted guitar and vocals, and industrial influenced percussion. Irish rock journalist Bill Graham cites David Bowie's album Low as a major influence on Zoo Station , which he called a new brand of glam rock with Spartan rhythms and sudden flurries of melody . Susan Fast The song is played at a tempo of 130 beats per minute in a 4 4 time signature, but only one element of the song's introduction, a marimba like texture, is played in common time. This sound, which has been compared to that of a clock ticking, was achieved by picking the guitar's D string behind the bridge and the stopbar. On the second half of the third beat, the song's signature guitar riff, a distorted descending glissando, enters. The glissando descends past the octave it begins in by a major second before returning to it. After the second time it is played, an explosion of percussion is heard, playing on beat four of every second measure on two occasions. This percussion sound, played by Flood, enters early the third time, being played on beat two. The drums then enter, before stopping and starting again. Much like the song's guitar sounds, the drums' timbre is noticeably different from previous U2 songs as it exhibits a cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can . Amidst layers of various guitar sounds, the bass enters, the part played in the introduction and verses consisting of repeating G and A notes, mimicking the ascending portion of the guitar riff after the glissando overshoots the octave. After the bass begins, the song's regular groove is established. At 0 45, the chord progression changes. Fifteen seconds later, the song returns to the previous chord progression and the introduction ends. Guitarist The Edge explained that some of the sounds in the introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar. Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don't know what you are listening to. Author Albin Zak, in his book The Poetics of Rock, says of the introduction, Before any words are sung, the sounds alone alert the listener that the band has moved into new expressive territory. After the introduction, the song follows a conventional verse chorus form. The first verse begins one minute into the song, with Bono announcing, I'm ready, I'm ready for the laughing gas . During the verses, he sings primarily in a medium to low range and his vocals are treated with heavy processing, which takes out the bottom of the sound and emasculate his voice. The processing also introduces a wavering quality to his vocals. The guitar glissando continues to be played during the verses. The first chorus begins at 1 44, and the music mirrors the change in chord progression from the introduction's last 15 seconds. During the chorus, the bassline becomes more dynamic, playing descending quarter notes of GFDCDCAGA, before resuming the previous G and A pattern. Bono's vocals also become more dynamic in the chorus, featuring layers of both open throated singing and monotone lyric recitation, as well as both processed and unprocessed vocals. Along with introducing the band's new sound, the song opens the album as a statement of intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested I'm ready for what's next , as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks I'm ready to let go of the steering wheel . Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time Time is a train Makes the future the past Leaves you standing in the station Your face pressed up against the glass . Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive I'm ready, I'm ready for the push . Upon the release of Achtung Baby, Zoo Station was praised by many critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe said the song was one on which sonic assaults are teamed with dreamily processed vocals that recall Beatles psychedelia . The Orlando Sentinel called it blistering and praised the low mixing of Bono's vocals, which allowed The Edge's new versatility on guitar to draw more attention. BBC Music enjoyed The Edge's guitar squall and electronics creating a dense sound is irresistible , noting that Zoo Station was one track where the strategy creates moods rather than hummable tunes . Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the song announces a change, starting with a metallic clank, a buzzing guitar slide and a repeated electronic crunchnothing ethereal . He also noted that Bono's voice was electronically masked and the band's old style traded for a pushy bassline and a percussive stomp, although U2 can't resist some sweeter interludes . Rolling Stone was complimentary of The Edge, comparing his style of guitar playing on the song to using a rhythm instrument by repeating a dark, buzzing phrase that drives the beat . Allmusic reviewed the track favourably, saying there are layers to Bono's lyrics and that by the end of the track, the song and the band are soaring . Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune likened the song's introduction to trying to out demolish Ministry with grating metal on metal percussion and a belching guitar . He commented that the rude awakening that the song provides on the album as the opening track could only compare with the fingernails on chalkboard guitar scuzz of Neil Young's Hey Hey, My My Into the Black from Rust Never Sleeps. The song subsequently appeared as one of seven U2 songs in the 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories, and Secrets. Zoo Station is featured in the 2002 British comedy drama film About a Boy. In one scene, the main character, Will Hugh Grant , turns up the volume of the song as a childless effort to ignore Marcus Nicholas Hoult , a boy ringing Will's doorbell, prompting Marcus to ring it in unison with the beat of the song. The song was covered by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails on the 2011 cover album AHK toong BAY bi Covered. Zoo Station made its live debut on the opening night of the Zoo TV Tour on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, and was performed as the opening song at each of the 156 Zoo TV concerts. During performances of Zoo Station , Bono appeared on stage silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise, making his entrance as his leather clad stage persona The Fly , often goose stepping his way onto the stage. The Edge described the visual imagery displayed for the song in the context of Zoo TV's sensory overload that was intended as a commentary on mass media 'Zoo Station' is four minutes of a television that's not tuned in to any station, but giving you interference and 'shash' and almost a TV picture. Zoo Station was not played during the subsequent PopMart and Elevation Tours, but it returned to the group's set lists on the Vertigo Tour. The song was most often performed during the first encore, along with other Achtung Baby Zoo TV era songs, as part of a mini Zoo TV set paying homage to the band's 1990s era. It made its last appearance in November 2006 and was not played live again until the September 24, 2015 concert on the Innocence Experience Tour. Live performances of the song appear on the video releases Zoo TV Live from Sydney and Vertigo 2005 Live from Chicago. A live version of Zoo Station from the Vertigo Tour also appears as a B side on the maxi single for Window in the Skies .

"Zooropa is the eighth studio album by Irish rock band U2. Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and The Edge, it was released on 5 July 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record was a continuation of the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991. U2 began writing and recording Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the Zooropa leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full length album. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources, including leftover material from the Achtung Baby sessions. The album was not completed in time for the tour's resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording. Zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics. Despite none of its three singles Numb , Lemon , and Stay Faraway, So Close being hits consistently across regions, the record sold well upon release and peaked at number one in multiple countries. The album's charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies, however, were less than those of Achtung Baby. In 1994, Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Although the record was a success and music journalists view it as one of the group's most creative works, the band regard it with mixed feelings. U2 regained critical favour with their commercially successful 1991 album Achtung Baby and the supporting Zoo TV Tour in 1992. The record was a musical reinvention for the group, incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music into their sound. The tour was an elaborately staged multimedia event that satirised television and the viewing public's over stimulation by attempting to instill sensory overload in its audience. The band finished 1992 with one of their most successful years, selling 2.9 million concert tickets and reaching 10 million copies sold for Achtung Baby. Their 73 North American concerts from the year grossed US 67 million, easily the highest amount for any touring artist in 1992. The group concluded the North American Outside Broadcast leg of the tour on 25 November 1992, leaving them with a six month break before the tour resumed in Europe in May 1993 with the Zooropa leg. Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two did not want to settle back into domestic life. Bono said, We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road . But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going... The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording. After handling audio engineering for the recording of Achtung Baby, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops of interesting parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks. The group employed Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark Flood Ellisboth of whom worked on Achtung Babyto produce the sessions long time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two week shifts. The group often gave him in progress songs to adjust and to which he could add his own personality. Initially, the band did not have a clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album. The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool. Soon after the sessions commenced, Bono pushed for the band to work towards a full length album. The Edge was initially hesitant, but saw the opportunity as a challenge to quickly record an album before returning to tour and prove the band had not become spoiled by the luxury of ample recording time. Additionally, Bono and band manager Paul McGuinness had discussed the possibility of releasing a one two punch of records since the beginning of the Achtung Baby sessions. In early March, U2 reached a consensus to work towards a full length album. Much like they had for the Achtung Baby sessions, the band split work between two studios at once Adams operated a Soundtracs mixing console at The Factory, while Flood used an SSL console at the newly relocated Windmill Lane Studios. Due to the time limit, U2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace. They continued their long time practice of jamming in the studio. Eno and Flood edited together song sections they liked and then discussed the arrangements with the group. U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed he pointed at chords and various commands, such as hold , stop , change , and change back , to direct their performances. To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called fatting , which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24 track analogue recording, a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The production crew faced issues with audio spill at The Factory, as all group members recorded in the same room as the mixing desk and Bono frequently sang in progress lyrics that would need to be replaced. Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers' sounds as much as possible. The Edge Songs originated from and were inspired by a variety of sources. Zooropa was the result of combining two separate pieces of music together, one of which the band discovered while reviewing recordings of tour soundchecks. The verse melody to Stay Faraway, So Close and an instrumental backing track that became Numb were originally from the Achtung Baby sessions. Babyface , Dirty Day , Lemon , and The Wanderer were written during the Zooropa sessions. Country singer Johnny Cash recorded vocals for The Wanderer during a visit to Dublin, and although Bono recorded his own vocals for the song, he preferred Cash's version. The production crew and the band debated which version to include on the record. Throughout the sessions, U2 were undecided on a unifying musical style for the release, and as a result, they maintained three potential track listingsone for the best songs, one for vibes , and one for a soundtrack album. Bono suggested editing the best segments of songs together to create a montage. As May's Zooropa tour leg approached, U2 continued to record while simultaneously rehearsing for the tour. Their time limit prevented them from working on live arrangements for any of the new songs. Despite the sessions' rapid pace, the album was not completed by the time they had to resume touring. Moreover, Flood and Eno had to begin work on other projects. The Edge remembers everyone was telling the group, Well, it's an EP. You did good but there's a lot more work needed to finish some of these songs. However, the band did not want to shelve the project, as they believed they were on a creative roll and that they would be in a completely different frame of mind if they revisited the material six months later. The group's solution was to fly back and forth between Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off days. Clayton called the process about the craziest thing you could do to yourself , while Mullen said of it, It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad. McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing . Flood called the period one of absolute lunacy . Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a live performance attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel. Recording concluded on 14 May 1993. In the final weeks, the band decided to exclude the traditional rock songs and guitar driven tracks they had written in favour of an album of disjointed, experimental pop . The Edge received a production credithis first on a U2 record for the extra level of responsibility he assumed for the album. Twenty songs were recorded during the sessions, but ultimately 10 were chosen for the final track listing. One piece that was left off the record was In Cold Blood , which featured somber lyrics written by Bono in response to the Bosnian War and was previewed prior to the album's release. Other tracks that were left off the album included Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me , If God Will Send His Angels , If You Wear That Velvet Dress , and Wake Up Dead Man . The first was later released as a single from the Batman Forever soundtrack in 1995, and the latter three were included on the band's following studio album, Pop, in 1997. With an even more European musical aesthetic than Achtung Baby, Zooropa is a further departure from the group's rootsy sound of the late 1980s. Much like how the group embraced technology for the Zoo TV Tour, they utilized technology as a musical resource to a greater extent on Zooropa. The record exhibits additional influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial musicit is more synthesised than U2's past work, featuring various sound effects, audio loops, and use of synthesisers. In addition to The Edge playing synthesiser, Brian Eno received credit for the instrument on six tracks. The Edge's guitar playing on Zooropa marks a further shift away from his trademark style, highlighted by a heavier reliance on guitar effects and the songs' reduced emphasis on his guitar parts. The danceable Lemon , called a space age German disco by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, features a gated guitar part. The distorted Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car was described by Bono as industrial blues . The instrumentation of the closing song, The Wanderer , consists primarily of a synthesised bassline and was described by the group as resembling the ultimate Holiday Inn band from hell . The song was sequenced as the final track because U2 wanted to end the album on a musical joke . Similar to how the Zoo TV Tour display screens sampled video footage from television programming, a number of songs from Zooropa sample audio. The introduction to the title track, Zooropa , contains a noisy collage of indecipherable human voices from radio signalscredited to the advertising world played over sustained synthesiser chords. The industrial influenced Numb features a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including arcade sounds , a Walkman rewinding, and a Hitler Youth boy banging a bass drum in the 1935 propaganda film Triumph of the Will. Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car begins with a snippet of fanfare from Lenin's Favourite Songs and samples MC 900 Ft. Jesus' song The City Sleeps . The vocals on Zooropa are a further departure from U2's previous style. As Jon Pareles described, Bono underplays his lung power throughout the record, in contrast to his impassioned, belting vocals from past work. Additionally, in songs such as Lemon and Numb , Bono sings in an operatic falsetto he calls the Fat Lady voice. Two tracks feature other people on lead vocals for Numb , The Edge provides lead vocals in the form of a droning, monotonous list of don't commands for The Wanderer , country musician Johnny Cash sings lead vocals, juxtaposing the electronic nature of the song with his haggard voice. Bono is credited as the sole lyricist for eight of the ten songs, while The Edge received sole credit for Numb . The duo share credits for the lyrics to Dirty Day . Technology is a common theme on Zooropa, inspired by the group's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour. Jon Pareles wrote that the songs are about how media messages infect characters' souls , while music journalist David Browne said the songs are concerned with emotional fracturing in the techno tronic age . Critic Robert Hilburn interpreted the album as U2 probing into what they saw as the disillusionment of the modern age . Zooropa is set amongst neon signs of a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song's introduction, background voices ask, What do you want In response to the question, the lyrics in the first three verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, Better by design , Be all that you can be , and Vorsprung durch technik . Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to signify the emptiness of modern, godless life . In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines I have no compass And I have no map . Babyface is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. Lemon , inspired by an old video of Bono's late mother in a lemon coloured dress, describes man's attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, A man makes a picture A moving picture Through the light projected he can see himself up close . The lyrics to Numb are a series of don't commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you . In contrast to the technology inspired lyrics of many songs, others had more domestic themes. The First Time was Bono's interpretation of the story of the Prodigal son, but in his version, the son decides not to return home. Similarly, Dirty Day was written about a character who abandons his family and returns years later to meet his son. Many of the track's lyrics are taken from phrases that Bono's father commonly used, such as No blood is thicker than ink and It won't last kissing time . Stay Faraway, So Close is a love song written for an abused woman. Bono based his lyrics to The Wanderer on the Old Testament's Book of Ecclesiastes, and he modeled the song's character after the book's narrator, The Preacher . In the song, the narrator wanders through a post apocalyptic world in search of experience , sampling all facets of human culture and hoping to find meaning in life. Bono described the song as an antidote to the Zooropa manifesto of uncertainty , and he believes it presents a possible solution to the uncertainty expressed earlier on the album. The sleeve was designed by Works Associates of Dublin under the direction of Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers. Brian Williams was the graphic designer and created the digital images and layout. Inspired by the Zoo TV Tour's highly charged electronic TV images in all of their saturated colours and fizz , Works Associates conceived a kind of electronic flag for Zooropa. The cover features a sketch of the circle of stars from the Flag of Europe with an astrobaby drawing in the center. The illustration, created by Shaughn McGrath, was an alteration of the graffiti babyface by Charlie Whisker that was originally on the face of the Achtung Baby compact disc vinyl record. The cover's drawing was meant to represent an urban legend of a Soviet cosmonaut supposedly left floating in orbit for weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the background is a montage of blurred images, similar to the arrangement of images on Achtung Baby's sleeve. The images include shots of a woman's face and mouth, as well as photographs of European leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Benito Mussolini, and Nicolae Ceausescu. These images are obscured by distorted purple text comprising the names of songs planned for the record that were provided to Works Associates during the sleeve design process. However, the album's track listing was eventually changed and the titles of several songs withheld from the album were accidentally left in the cover image the songs include Wake Up Dead Man , Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me , and If You Wear That Velvet Dress . Author Visnja Cogan described this text as giving the impression of a torn veil . Zooropa was named for the Zooropa leg of the Zoo TV Tour, which began in May 1993 while the band completed the record. The name is a portmanteau of zoo from Zoo TV Tour and Zoo Station and Europa . During the album's production, one of the proposed titles was Squeaky. Zooropa completed U2's contractual obligation to Island Records, and to PolyGram, the multinational that purchased Island in 1989. Although the group were free to sign a new contract elsewhere, their strong relationship with the label and its founder Chris Blackwell prompted the band to remain with Island Polygram by signing a long term, six album deal in June 1993. The Los Angeles Times estimated that the deal was worth US 60 million to U2, making them the highest paid rock group ever. At the time, the group were cognizant of several emerging technologies that would potentially impact the delivery and transmission of music to consumers in the following years. Author Bill Flanagan speculated, Record stores could become obsolete as music is delivered over cable, telephone wires, or satellite transmissions directly into consumers' homes. With uncertainty over the future of these technologies and the implications of entertainment and telecommunications companies merging, the band negotiated with Island that the division of their earnings from future transmission systems would be flexible and decided upon at a relevant time. U2 toyed with the idea of releasing Zooropa as an interactive audio video presentation in lieu of conventional physical formats, but the deadline imposed by the Zoo TV Tour prevented the band from realising this idea. U2's delivery of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off guard, because they were not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president CEO Rick Dobbis explained For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street with that same spirit. Island PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Baby's five singles. The first single Numb was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a video single . The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US. Zooropa was released on 5 July 1993, during the Zooropa leg of the Zoo TV Tour. An initial shipment of 1.6 million copies was made available in stores at the time of release. The album performed very well commercially, debuting at number one in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland. It also reached number one in the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Iceland. In the US, the album spent its first two weeks on the Billboard 200 at the top spot, staying in the top 10 for seven weeks. In its first week on sale, Zooropa sold 377,000 copies in the US, the group's best debut in the country to that point. The album reached the top 10 in 26 countries. Despite reaching impressive peak positions, it had a shorter stay on the music charts than Achtung Baby did. In total, Zooropa spent 40 weeks on the Billboard 200, 61 fewer weeks than Achtung Baby. Similarly, the album's stay of 34 weeks on the UK Albums Chart was a decrease of 58 weeks from its predecessor. Two additional commercial singles were released from the album. Lemon received a limited commercial release in North America, Australia, and Japan in September 1993. The single peaked at number six in Australia and number three on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The final commercial single was Stay Faraway, So Close , released worldwide on 22 November 1993. It was the album's most successful single, topping the Irish Singles Chart and peaking at number five in Australia, number six in New Zealand, number four in the UK, and number 61 in the US making it the record's only single to chart on the UK Singles Chart and Hot 100. Zooropa was released as a promotional single in Mexico and the United States. By the end of 1993, Zooropa had sold 1.8 million copies in the US. In October 2011, Achtung Baby was reissued to commemorate its 20th anniversary CD copies of Zooropa were included in the Super Deluxe and Uber Deluxe editions of the release. Continuing a campaign by U2 to reissue all of their records on vinyl, Zooropa was re released on two 180 gram vinyl records on 27 July 2018. Remastered under the Edge's direction, the reissue included two remixes to commemorate the album's 25th anniversary Lemon The Perfecto Mix and Numb Gimme Some More Dignity Mix . Each copy includes a download card that can be used to redeem a digital copy of the album. Zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics. Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote in his four star review that the album was a daring, imaginative coda to Achtung Baby and that it is varied and vigorously experimental, but its charged mood of giddy anarchy suffused with barely suppressed dread provides a compelling, unifying thread . Spin wrote a positive review, commenting that the record sounds mostly like a band shedding its skin, trying on different selves for size . The review said the album has the feel of real collectivity , praising the cohesiveness of the individual band members' playing. The review concluded by saying Zooropa indicates U2 might be worthy of whatever absurd mutations the '90s throw our way . Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the group for transforming themselves and becoming raucous, playful and ready to kick its old habits . Pareles enjoyed the sonics and electronic effects that made the sound of a straightforward four man band ... hard to find , and he commented that The new songs seem destined not for stadiums ... but for late night radio shows and private listenings through earphones. The Orlando Sentinel gave the record a rating of three out of five stars, commenting, Although U2 leans heavily on the electronic sound of contemporary dance music, the rhythm tracks on Zooropa are less than propulsive. The review said that Eno's production and the electronic flourishes made the album interesting, but that ultimately, there's nothing especially hummable and the songs are not very memorable . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Zooropa an A , calling it harried, spontaneous sounding, and ultimately exhilarating album . Browne judged it to sound messy and disconnected , but clarified that sense of incoherence is the point in the context of the record's technology themes. He concluded, For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour so much so that it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour and yet sounds like a souvenir of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a creative stretch , noting that the band experimented more yet retained their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's yearning anthemic reach and obvious, slinky pop charm were replaced with darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness . Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four out of five stars, finding a freewheeling feel of going with the flow throughout the album and calling it rootless and loose, restless and unsettled . For Du Noyer, U2 sounded monstrously tight as a performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental . A review from The New Zealand Herald was more critical, saying that the album started as an EP and just got longer but not necessarily better . The publication called it more perplexing than challenging and commented that it sounds like the biggest band in the world having one of the biggest, strangest mid life crises . Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun Times gave the record a three and a half star review, calling it inconsistent , but admitting it's satisfying and surprising to hear a band of U2's status being so playful, experimental, and downright weird . Robert Christgau gave the album a B, calling it half an Eno album in the same manner that David Bowie's Eno produced albums Low and Heroes were, but saying, The difference is that Bowie and Eno were fresher in 1977 than Bono and Eno are today. The Irish media were more critical in their reviews of the album George Byrne of the Irish Independent said, The songs sound like they were knocked up in double quick time and with about as much thought put into the lyrics as goes into a DJ's timecheck . Byrne remarked that the record resembles a lot of mickey taking over a variety of drum patterns . In a retrospective, four star review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that most of the record is far more daring than its predecessor . For him, although there were moments that the album was unfocused and meandering ... the best moments of Zooropa rank among U2's most inspired and rewarding music . Zooropa finished in 9th place on the Best Albums list from The Village Voice's 1993 Pazz Jop critics' poll. At the 36th Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best Alternative Music Album. In his acceptance speech, Bono sarcastically mocked the alternative characterisation the album received and used a profanity on live television I think I'd like to give a message to the young people of America. And that is We shall continue to abuse our position and fuck up the mainstream. The band began the Zoo TV Tour in February 1992 in support of Achtung Baby. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised television and the viewing public's over stimulation by attempting to instill sensory overload in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases. Live satellite link ups, channel surfing, crank calls, and video confessionals were incorporated into the shows. The Zooropa album was released in July 1993, halfway through the Zooropa leg of the tour. Of the 157 shows the band played during the Zoo TV Tour, approximately 30 of them were after the release of Zooropa. Many of the album's songs found permanent places in the shows' set lists. Lemon and Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car were performed with Bono in his MacPhisto persona, during encores of the Zoomerang Leg of the tour. Dirty Day was also played on this leg after the acoustic set. Numb was performed with The Edge playing guitar and on lead vocals, with Mullen performing backing vocals while drumming. Zooropa was played only three times and Babyface twice more at the same shows on the Zooropa leg, but they were cut out of the set list after the band were displeased with how they sounded live. Stay Faraway, So Close was performed acoustically for the Zooropa and Zoomerang legs. The Edge Zooropa is certified 2 Platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America, 3 Platinum in Australia, Platinum in the UK, and 4 Platinum in both New Zealand and Canada. To date, it has sold more than 7 million copies. After the release of the record, David Bowie praised the band, writing, might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they are one of the few rock bands even attempting to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wallthe year 2000. Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs The Edge said that he did not think the songs were potent , further stating, I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting. Clayton said, It's an odd record and a favourite of mine. Neil McCormick wrote about Zooropa, It feels like a minor work, and generally U2 don't do minor. But if you're not going to make the Big Statement, you're maybe going to come up with something that has the oxygen of pop music. In 1997, Spin wrote, Zooropa took U2 as far from the monastic mysticism of The Joshua Tree as they could go. It freed U2 from itself. Edna Gundersen of USA Today said in 2002, the alien territory of Achtung Baby and Zooropa cemented U2's relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers . In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked the record at number 61 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties . All lyrics are written by Bono, except where noted all music is composed by U2.

"Zooropa is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the opening track from their 1993 album Zooropa. The song was the result of combining two pieces of music, the first of which was conceived in the studio, and the second of which was discovered by guitarist The Edge while listening to soundchecks the band had done while on tour. The lyrics were written by vocalist Bono, describing two characters in a brightly lit city in a futuristic version of European society. Lyrics in the song were based on advertising slogans, and also featured the phrase dream out loud , which has appeared in other U2 media. The song touched on several themes, including moral confusion and the future of European society. Promotional recordings of the song were released in the United States and Mexico, and the song appeared on two record charts shortly after its release in 1993. The song was briefly performed at three shows on U2's Zoo TV Tour in 1993. The band had difficulties performing it in 1993, and it was not played again until the U2 360 Tour in 2011. The recording of the song received mostly positive reception from critics, who praised it as the album's opening track. During the Zoo TV Tour in 1992, U2 were trying to create a vision of an attractive future for Europe, as opposed to a negative, dystopian image that would be found in science fiction. With recent and ongoing events in Europe, such as the Revolutions of 1989, the enlargement of the European Union, and the Bosnian War, lead vocalist Bono created a surreal vision of a European location called Zooropa . Bono has referred to Zooropa as being a concept album, with a main theme of the exploration of interpellation within the European Union. Bono Bono and guitarist the Edge had been reading works by cyberpunk author William Gibson, who wrote about a futuristic urban environment known as The Sprawl . Gibson was an influence in the texture of the song, which Bono described as fucked up sci fi . Bono wanted to use noise to create a visual setting for the song, similar to Gibson's futuristic world, filled with advertisements on LED displays and neon signs, as in the 1982 film Blade Runner. With Zooropa as the album's opening song, Bono stated that he wanted the album's music to be like legal drugs that would create a trip where you come out of the other end and you feel like you've been on some kind of a journey . The closing song on the album, The Wanderer , features Johnny Cash on vocals, and was intended on being the antidote to the futuristic sounding opener. Zooropa was written and recorded during the album's sessions at Windmill Lane Studios and The Factory Studios in Dublin, which took place from March to May 1993 between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The song was created from two separate pieces of music. The first was a jam session recorded by the band in Dublin during the album's sessions. The second was a soundcheck the band had recorded a few years prior on tour in Australia or New Zealand that the Edge found while listening to cassette recordings of their soundchecks. Along with sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy, the Edge edited the best parts of the soundcheck using Sound Tools to create a song arrangement, which served as a backing track. The two halves of the song were then edited into a stereo mix. Producer Flood created an atmospheric mix and then crossfaded it in with the song's sombre, ethereal introduction. The bass guitar in the intro was played by drummer Larry Mullen Jr. while the Edge was busy working on the album's guitar riffs. Synthesizer sounds were added by producer Brian Eno on a Yamaha DX7 keyboard, including a squishy, mad synth sound to create a dovetail connecting the different segments of the song. The Edge later added guitar tracks, as well as additional sounds to the song using an EMS Synthi A synthesiser. Once the song was almost finished, the band had doubts about the first half's backing track. Having established an arrangement for the song, they performed it again in the studio and used the new recording for the first half, while using portions of the new performance for the second half. The band had originally intended on recording an EP during the sessions, but Zooropa eventually evolved into full length album. Zooropa was one of five songs that were part of what would have become the band's EP, which also included Babyface , Numb , Stay Faraway, So Close , and The Wanderer . Prior to the song's final title, it had the working title BabbleZooropa , as mentioned in a May 1993 issue of Hot Press, and was later titled Zooropa I II in a June 1993 issue of Billboard. Zooropa begins with a two minute long introduction. As the song fades in, sustained chords are played, and a noisy collage of mainly indecipherable human voices from radio signals fades in at 0 19. The background voices include a clip of George H. W. Bush saying Peace talks , and are referenced in the album notes as courtesy of the advertising world . A quiet piano and bass guitar are heard above the voices, which get louder with each beat. At 1 30, the volume of the voices rises suddenly and the bass part changes. The introduction then begins to fade out fifteen seconds later, while a guitar riff played with a delay and wah wah effect joins the mix. The riff is briefly played on its own before the bass guitar and drums join in at 2 03. This is followed by background voices saying, What do you want in both English and French Qu'est ce que tu veux , and De quoi as tu peur What are you afraid of . In response to the questions, the lyrics in the first three verses of the song consist of various advertising slogans. At 3 45, following the first three verses, a break in the song's instrumentation occurs, except for guitar, and the song returns to a state similar to the introduction's end. A rapid rhythmic synthesiser fades in and at 4 03, the drums and bass re enter and the song assumes an increased tempo. The theme of moral confusion and uncertainty becomes present in the remaining lyrics. Bono The song describes two characters in a setting with a dull and grey appeal, who emerge from blinking neon signs into a brightly lit modern city. The radio sound effects in the introduction were intended to create a mood and setting for the song. DJ Carter Alan noted that the sounds seemed to draw a connection from Achtung Baby, but Bono stated that it was not intentional and that he didn't want it to have anything to do with the past . The lyrics in Zooropa begin with the Audi advertising slogan Vorsprung durch Technik Advancement through technology and the first three verses feature references to slogans for other brands, including Colgate, Daz, Fairy, and Zanussi. Following the first three verses of advertising slogans, the song continues with the lyrics I have no compass, and I have no map and No reason to get back , referring to the uncertainty of the new direction of U2's music at the time. The following verse begins with, And I have no religion , which was included in the lyrics because Bono stated that he believes religion is the enemy of God. A review of the album in Melody Maker compared the lyric Uncertainty can be a guiding light towards the end of the song to the line If you walk away, ... I will follow from U2's 1980 single I Will Follow . The reviewer stated The man Bono that once had so many answers now sounds simply confused. The theme of moral confusion was first used in U2's song Acrobat from Achtung Baby. The coda in Zooropa features the lyric dream out loud , which Bono included as a reference to Acrobat . The phrase dream out loud was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989, and has appeared several times in U2's work since then. The phrase was also used in the song Always a B side to the Beautiful Day single released in 2000 and was spoken by Bono in the PopMart Live from Mexico City video. Zooropa was the opening track from the eponymous album, and promotional recordings promos of the song were distributed by Island Records in the United States and Mexico. The U.S. promo features an edited version of the song that fades in at the first guitar riff removing the intro , and the Mexico promo features the album version of the song, along with Numb as a second track. The cover art of the Mexico promo features the same logo from the Zooropa album covera sketch of the circle of stars from the Flag of Europe with an astrobaby figure in the middle, based on the graffiti babyface from the Achtung Baby album artwork. The logo represents an urban legend about a Soviet cosmonaut left floating in orbit for weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zooropa was one of four songs from the album to be featured on the Billboard charts, and was the only song to chart that was not released as a single. On 24 July 1993, it appeared on the Album Rock Tracks chart at number 26, and remained on the chart for ten weeks, eventually peaking at number eight. Zooropa also appeared on the Modern Rock Tracks chart on 7 August 1993 at number 28, and peaked at number 13 during its eight weeks on the chart. During the Zoo TV Tour, clips of Zooropa were played during the beginning of the show. The clips included the lyric What do you want repeated twice, which was displayed on video screens in various languages, and interspersed with a voice saying It's very simple . This part of the opening segment was intended to create confusion among the audience regarding the show's message, and eventually lead to information overload. U2 performed Zooropa live at three consecutive concerts during the fourth leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1993. Bono originally discussed how the song would be played live during the album's recording sessions, saying that The Edge's guitar riffs may be extended in concert. The song debuted live at a concert in Glasgow in August 1993, and was performed in the middle of the set list following Numb . The live version was much shorter than the album version, skipping the piano intro, as well as the first three verses, starting with the line I have no compass, and I have no map . U2 had difficulty performing the song live, which Bono acknowledged to the audience following its debut. According to the book U2 Live A Concert Documentary, the song's first performance sounded shaky and needed more rehearsal, although its subsequent Zoo TV performances sound better . Adam Clayton suggested performing the song as the show opener during the rehearsals for the tour's fifth and final Zoomerang leg, but it was not performed again on the tour. After Zoo TV, Zooropa was not performed live for 18 years until it was played towards the end of the U2 360 Tour in 2011. Clayton said that adding the song to the tour's set list was very experimental and that it was a bit cheeky to introduce to the tour as the band had little experience performing it. The song debuted on the tour on 10 April 2011 in Sao Paulo, and was rehearsed at soundchecks several days prior. The return of the song was so popular that the word Zooropa became a trending topic on Twitter during the evening of its tour debut. Zooropa was performed at the remaining 26 concerts on the tour, in addition to a private show in Denver. As of 2011 , Zooropa has been performed live at 31 shows. During performances, the stage's 360 retractable video screen would expand its full length, and U2 would perform behind the screen as it took over the stage. The Edmonton Journal commented that by hiding themselves from the fans during the performance, the combination of advertising slogans and flickering lights help portray this Blade Runner type world that U2 wants us to escape. A live recording of Zooropa from the U2 360 Tour was featured on the U2.com member exclusive album, U22, taken from the performance in Baltimore on 22 June 2011. The song was not performed during the first leg of the Innocence Experience Tour, but at the first show of the European leg in September 2015, a stripped down version was performed during the second half of the concert. This interpretation of the song lacks the piano intro and first verses, serving as a segue from Bullet the Blue Sky into Where the Streets Have No Name . David Sinclair of The Times and Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone both felt that Zooropa set the album's tone from the start. DeCurtis described Bono's singing and lyrics as a Mephistophelean seducer . Allmusic compared Zooropa to the anthems of U2's The Joshua Tree album, and Entertainment Weekly's David Browne described the song as 'Where the Streets Have No Name' transported into the land of cyberpunk , comparing parts of the song to the techno and metallic music genres. The Independent felt Zooropa was a sprawling multi sectioned piece that drifts from two minutes of gentle radio babble into a more familiar reverb rock structure . Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that the track was reminiscent of old U2 songs, but added new elements such as distorted vocals and repeating guitar squealing. Daily Variety praised the title track over the rest of the songs on the album, stating how it was the only song that explores the sort of melodic range usually associated with U2 . Robert Vagacs, author of Religious Nuts, Political Fanatics Robert Vagacs, author of the book Religious Nuts, Political Fanatics U2 in the Theological Perspective, describes the song as the antimatter of Where the Streets Have No Name , in both musical and thematic aspects. Vagacs discusses the concept of Zooropa in detail throughout the book, and refers to Zooropa as a wasteland and a dystopia , due to its lack of fulfilment and certainty. He also states how the Babylonian like location uses its demigods to control its people through scientism, technicism, and economism. The final track from Achtung Baby, Love Is Blindness , is described as an interpretive bridge into the land of Zooropa , which Vagacs explains is the setting for the album, as well as the setting for songs on U2's following album, Pop. Beautiful Day , the opening song from U2's 2000 album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, describes a fresh start in Zooropa . The use of consumer slogans as song lyrics was also commented on by various sources. Critic Perry Gettelman interpreted them as meaning to signify the emptiness of modern, godless life . Kieran Keohane of York University stated that the slogans in Zooropa were to express an alienating form of interpellation, while J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun referred to the slogans as a parody of the economic hype used to pass the Maastricht Treaty, through the promising of impossibilities, such as Be a winner and Eat to get slimmer . English professor Kurt Koenigsberger of Case Western Reserve University stated that the consumer advertisements constitute Zooropa as a sardonically dystopic location. In the book Reading Rock and Roll, Robyn Brothers said that the song conveys a sense of confusion in the wake of a technology speeding beyond our control , while referencing the lyrics I hear voices, ridiculous voices I'm in the slipstream . Brothers also compared the song to Acrobat , stating both songs reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Zooropa producer Flood said that Zooropa was one of his favourite songs on the album, along with Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car , The First Time , and Numb . Mullen felt that the song was absolutely mesmerizing . Following the release of Zooropa , references to the song have appeared in professional writings and in other media. On the day of the U2 concert in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in 1997, tour set designer Willie Williams wrote about waking up that day with Zooropa playing in his head and stated that Sarajevo is the city of Zooropa, if there ever was one. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, quoted the song's lyrics at a 2005 press conference after enlisting Bono in an effort to get governments in the European Union to give more money to developing countries, and stated that the lyrics inspired an article he wrote about the future of Europe. Thomas Diez of the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute made references to Zooropa 's lyrics in a 1999 book review about the history of the European Union lyrics also appeared in a 2005 GermanEnglish dictionary, under its listing for Vorsprung durch Technik . Kurt Koenigsberger's book The Novel and the Menagerie mentioned Zooropa in a section discussing Salman Rushdie and his appearance on the Zoo TV Tour. In 2008, the word Zooropa was used in an international finance textbook as the name of a fictional, generic city. The book Religious Nuts, Political Fanatics lists Zooropa as one of 22 U2 songs for recommended listening . A 2009 review of U2's album No Line on the Horizon, MusicRadar described the song Magnificent as 'New Year's Day' meets 'Zooropa' .

"Edward James Zosky born February 10, 1968 is a former professional baseball shortstop. He played in brief parts of five seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1991 and 2000, for the Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins, Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros. He also played in the Baltimore Orioles, San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates minor league systems. Zosky was a collegiate star prior to playing professionally, becoming a member of Fresno State University's athletic Hall of Fame. He developed into a promising shortstop prospect for the Toronto Blue Jays in the early 1990s, being named their starting shortstop of the future multiple times, though injury problems and a lack of offense ended his hopes of stardom. Zosky began his professional career in 1989 at the age of 21 and played for 12 seasons until the age of 32 in 2000. He spent most of his professional career in the minor leagues, spending parts of two seasons at the rookie level, part of one season at the Class A level, two full seasons at the Double A level, parts of three seasons at the Triple A level and seven full seasons at the Triple A level. In total, he played in 1,056 minor league games, hitting .257 with 59 home runs and 407 RBI in 3,670 at bats. Defensively, he spent 752 games at shortstop, 147 games at third base, 139 games at second base, two games at pitcher and one game in the outfield. As a pitcher, he threw 113 innings, striking out two batters and allowing one earned run, posting a 6.75 ERA. He spent parts of five seasons at the Major League level 1991, 1992, 1995, 1999 and 2000. He played in 44 big league games, collecting eight hits in 50 at bats for a .160 batting average. Though he never hit a home run, he did collect two triples and a double, while driving three runs in. Defensively, he played 30 games at shortstop starting eight of them , four games at third base and three games at second base. He committed two errors for a .967 fielding percentage, while turning eight double plays. At all levels, both Major League and minor league, Zosky hit a combined .256 with 59 home runs and 410 RBI in 3,720 at bats. Zosky, who is Jewish, was born in Whittier, California to Ed and Yvonne Zosky and attended St. Paul High School in Santa Fe Springs, California, graduating in 1986. After his graduation from high school, he attended Fresno State University, where he mostly played shortstop. He hit .292 in his first season with Fresno State University, earning second team all league honors. In May 1988, he suffered from mononucleosis and an ankle sprain, slightly shortening his sophomore season. In addition, Zosky was selected to try out for the United States Olympic baseball team in June of his sophomore season, along with teammates Tom Goodwin and John Salles. Though he was considered the front runner for the shortstop position on the Olympic squad, he did not make the team. During his junior and final season at Fresno State University, Zosky was named Sporting News and Baseball America All Americans after posting a .370 batting average. In addition, he was named first team All Big West, along with teammates Bobby Jones, Tom Goodwin and Rich Crane. His Australian son Gage went on to play Pitcher for New York Yankees Zosky was drafted by Major League Baseball teams twice. Originally, he was drafted out of St. Paul High School by the New York Mets in the fifth round of the 1986 amateur draft, 128th overall. He did not sign, choosing to attend college instead. He was next drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays 19th overall in the first round of the 1989 draft, out of Fresno State University. He was one of three Fresno State University alum drafted in the first round that year, the others being Steve Hosey 14th overall and Tom Goodwin 22nd overall . It was the first time since the 1979 draft that one school had three different players selected in the first round. The last school to do it was the University of Michigan. The Toronto Blue Jays gave Zosky a 185,000 374,000 today signing bonus. The initial plan was to have Zosky begin his professional career with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Single A Florida State League. However, citing poor performances by his current shortstops, Double A manager Barry Foote had Zosky start with the Southern League Knoxville Blue Jays. He made his professional debut on July 4, collecting a hit and driving in the Knoxville Blue Jays lone run in his first professional game. He played 56 games at shortstop for the Knoxville Blue Jays, batting .221 with a .303 slugging percentage. In 1990, Zosky was ranked the third best prospect in the Southern League. Though he attended Major League spring training, he spent the entire season in the minor leagues, playing for the Double A Knoxville Blue Jays and hitting .271 in 115 games tying William Suero for the team lead in triples with seven. Prior to the 1991 season, Baseball America named Zosky the 22nd best prospect in professional baseball, ahead of Jeff Bagwell 32nd , Chipper Jones 49th and Jim Thome 93rd . That season, he attended his second Major League spring training, and was in competition with Manuel Lee and Rene Gonzales for the starting shortstop position. However, after making six errors during the spring, he was deemed unready for Major League action and sent to minor league camp on April 1. He spent most of the season with the Triple A International League Syracuse Chiefs, hitting .264 with six home runs, 39 RBI and 69 runs. He led the team in both plate appearances and at bats, and, despite committing 24 errors in the field, he led league shortstops with 221 putouts, 371 assists and 88 double plays. His performance landed him a spot on the 1991 International League All Star Team, as well as a September 1 promotion to the Major Leagues. Though Zosky spent the majority of the 1991 season with the Syracuse Chiefs, he made his Major League Baseball debut that season as well. He appeared in his first big league game on September 2, against the Baltimore Orioles replacing shortstop Manuel Lee, who had been feeling dizzy and suffering from a stiff neck, in the top of the fourth inning. In the fifth inning, facing pitcher Dave Johnson in his first at bat, Zosky singled to left field. Later in the game, he was replaced by Rance Mulliniks. So anticipated was Zosky's debut that Toronto Star writer Dave Perkins compared Zosky's debut to Lou Gehrig in 1925, asking Did Manuel Lee just become Manuel Pipp in reference to Gehrig usurping Wally Pipp's first base position that season . The next day, September 3, he made his first Major League start, again against the Baltimore Orioles. Batting ninth in the starting lineup, he collected zero hits in three at bats, striking out twice against pitchers Ben McDonald and Mike Flanagan. He spent 18 games in total with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1991, batting .148 with two runs and two RBI in 27 at bats. Though he did not hit a home run, two of his four hits were for extra basesthe first was a triple off of Bob Welch and the second was a double off of Denny Neagle. He also drove in his first career RBIs against Welch, scoring John Olerud and Candy Maldonado on the same play. Prior to the 1992 minor league baseball season, Baseball America ranked Zosky as the 82nd best prospect in professional baseball. Though he was expected to unseat Manuel Lee as the starting shortstop for the 1992 Major League season, he began the year with the Triple A Syracuse Chiefs after posting a batting average of .151 and committing five errors during spring training. Rather than giving Zosky the backup job, the Blue Jays gave it to non roster invitee Alfredo Griffin, who had been signed previously. He struggled early during the season with batting averages of .150 and .160 in April and May, respectively, and though he batted .350 in June, his season batting average was only .231. Following the conclusion of the 1992 minor league season in September, Zosky was promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays, with whom he appeared in eight games. He batted .286 in seven at bats, with one of his two hits being a triple which he hit off of Jose Mesa on September 14exactly one year after his first career extra base hit, which was also a triple . Following the 1992 regular season, Zosky played for the Tucson Javelinas in the newly formed Arizona Fall League, hitting .326. As early as January 1993, Zosky was expected to be the Toronto Blue Jays' starting shortstop for the 1993 regular season. However, later that month Zosky was shut down due to a muscle problem in his throwing elbow. To provide insurance in case Zosky floundered, the Toronto Blue Jays signed veteran free agent Dick Schofield, who had played for the California Angels and New York Mets the previous season. They also re signed Alfredo Griffin and traded Kelly Gruber and cash to the California Angels for Luis Sojo, who would provide even further insurance in case Zosky failed. Though Zosky was expected to be the starting shortstop earlier in the year, by February Schofield was the leading contender for the position. Due to his struggles in 1992 not only did he hit .231, he also committed 27 errors and his injuries, the Blue Jays began looking beyond Zosky as the future starting shortstop for the team, paying more attention to their other prospect Alex Gonzalez. After undergoing a surgery on his bad elbow to remove a bone spur on March 16, Zosky's starting prospects dimmed even further he was placed on the 15 day disabled list on March 26, 1993, later spending some time in extended spring training. He returned to the playing field in late July, and played in 33 minor league games five in a rehabilitation stint with the Hagerstown Suns, for whom he hit .100 in 20 at bats and 28 for the Syracuse Chiefs, for whom he hit .215 in 103 at bats. Overall, he batted .195 with zero home runs and nine RBI, while committing five errors in the field. He did not play in the Major Leagues in 1993. Instead, Dick Schofield was the Opening Day starter, though Tony Fernandez seized the starting job after his June 11 trade to the Blue Jays from the New York Mets. Following the 1993 season, he played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League. By 1994, Alex Gonzalez had all but replaced Zosky as the Blue Jays' shortstop of the future. Though he had some bright moments during that season's spring training, including a game winning three run home run in an exhibition game on March 23, Zosky had become relegated to back up status as Dick Schofield was set to make another Opening Day start this time as a placeholder for Gonzalez, rather than Zosky. As it turned out, Gonzalez won the starting shortstop job and was the Opening Day performer at that position. By April 28, however, Gonzalez was struggling, Schofield had retaken the starting shortstop position, and because he was performing well with the Syracuse Chiefs Zosky was back in the mix as a potential suitor for the position himself. Schofield retained a hold on the job, however, and Zosky spent the entire year in Triple A with the Chiefs, batting .264 with seven home runs and 34 RBI in 85 games, rattling off a 16 game hitting streak at one point. Though he played a shortened season due to injury, he tied Robert Montalvo for the team lead in sacrifice hits with six. Despite hitting .264, his on base percentage was only .287 as he walked only nine times in 284 at bats. Though a shortstop by trade, he played more games at second base 41 than shortstop 34 that season. On November 18, 1994, Zosky's Blue Jays career came to an end when he was traded to the Florida Marlins by for a player to be named later, who ended up being minor league pitcher Scott Pace. That was the first trade ever made by new Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash, who replaced Pat Gillick following the 1994 season. Zosky made the Marlins Opening Day roster for the 1995 season and on April 29, he played in his first Major League game since October 4, 1992. Facing Trevor Wilson of the San Francisco Giants, Zosky singled in his first big league at bat in over two seasons. He played the whole game, going 1 for 3 at the plate. Appearing in only six games at the Major League level in 1995 with the single in his first at bat his only big league hit , Zosky spent most of the year with the Triple A International League's Charlotte Knights, to whom he was optioned after the Marlins cut their roster from 28 to 25 players on May 15. With Charlotte, he hit .247 with three home runs and 42 RBI in 92 games, walking only seven times in 312 at bats. On October 16, he was granted free agency. On January 24, 1996, Zosky signed a contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He spent most of the season with the Orioles' Triple A International League affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings, though he also spent a game with their rookie level affiliate, the Gulf Coast League Orioles. That season, he hit a combined .257 with three home runs, 34 RBI and a career high 23 doubles. With eight double plays grounded into, he tied Joe Hall for the Red Wings team lead. On October 15, he was granted free agency by the Orioles. On November 25, 1996, the San Francisco signed Zosky to a contract, making him a non roster invitee to spring training. He was cut from the big league squad on March 17 and was assigned to minor league camp the following day. He then spent the entire 1997 season in Triple A, playing for the Pacific Coast League's Phoenix Firebirds. He began the season with a bang, hitting a grand slam on April 6 against the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. In total, he played in 86 games that season, hitting .278 with nine home runs and 45 RBI. Defensively, he spent more games at third base 42 than at his natural shortstop position 30 . On October 15, 1997, he was granted free agency by the Giants. On December 17, 1997, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Zosky as a free agent, inviting him to spring training. By the second week of the 1998 season's spring training, it looked as though Zosky would earn a spot on the Brewers' 25 man roster he would eventually be cut after the Brewers purchased outfielder Eric Owens from the Florida Marlins, however, and spend the entire season with the Triple A Louisville Redbirds. That season, he hit .245 with eight home runs and 35 RBI in 90 games. He pitched for the first time in his career that season as well, appearing as a reliever in one game, allowing one hit and striking out the second batter he faced. He was granted free agency by the Brewers on October 15, but was re signed on December 18 and given an invite to spring training. Like in previous years, Zosky began the 1999 season in Triple A, playing for the Louisville RiverBats. He remained with the RiverBats through late July, though after catcher Bobby Hughes went on the 15 day disabled list, the Brewers purchased Zosky's contract and brought him up to the Major League team. He made his first Major League appearance since May 14, 1995, when, on August 1, 1999, he pinch hit for Brewers pitcher Reggie Harris in the sixth inning and remained in the game, replacing Ronnie Belliard at second base. In his first Major League game in over four seasons, Zosky went 1 for 2 at the plate, collecting a single in his second at bat off of Montreal Expos pitcher Dan Smith. Just a few days later, on August 5, he was assigned back to Louisville. He earned yet another promotion to the Major Leagues on September 5 with starting shortstop Mark Loretta injured and pitcher Chad Fox placed on the 60 day disabled list. In total, he played in eight games for the Brewers that season, collecting one hit in seven at bats for a .143 batting average. He had perhaps the best minor league season of his career in 1999, as he hit .294 with 12 home runs and 47 RBI all career highs . Following the season, on October 7, he refused a minor league assignment and became a free agent. On January 18, 2000, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Zosky to a minor league contract, also offering him an invitation to spring training. On March 15, the Pirates assigned him to minor league camp. He began the 2000 season in the Pirates minor league system, playing in 53 games for the Triple A Nashville Sounds with whom he hit .221 with two home runs and 16 RBI and in eight games for the rookie level GCL Pirates with whom he hit .333 with six doubles in 30 at bats . On August 23, he was traded to the Houston Astros for a player to be named later. He began his stint in the Astros organization in the minor leagues, playing in 11 games with the Triple A New Orleans Zephyrs and hitting .273 in 33 at bats. On September 12, the Astros purchased his contract, bringing him up to the Major League squad. The Astros used him sporadically after his promotion as he played in four games with them, collecting zero hits in four at bats. His final appearance with the Astros, on October 1, would also be the final game of his professional career. On October 11, he became a free agent. No team ended up signing him. In the minor leagues that season, he hit a combined .247 with two home runs and 22 RBI in 72 games.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie%20Zosky
"Zou Bisou Bisou also performed as Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo is a song written by Bill Shepherd and Alan Tew, and Michel Rivgauche for the lyrics of the French version. The song's origins stem from the Ye ye movement with which an early version of the song was associated. Its theme is variously described as an open declaration of love and the joy of kissing. Zou Bisou Bisou was Gillian Hills' first single in the summer of 1960. A French recording, titled Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo , was produced by George Martin and sung in English by Sophia Loren. Although most sources associate the origins of the song with Hills, New York claims that the songwriting credits make it more likely that Loren's version was the original. Slate's David Haglund notes that Hills' version is the best known of the early recordings. It was performed by Jessica Pare as Megan Draper in the first episode of the Mad Men Season 5 airdate March 26, 2012 . The morning after its on air performance on AMC, the song was released as a music download and as a vinyl special edition. Pare's on air performance of the song was lip synced to a prior recording. Martin's production of Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo was originally recorded by Sophia Loren as publicity associated with the film The Millionairess 1960 on the album Peter and Sophia. Several sources, including a posting at AMC's website, state that Hills did not produce her version, with Rivgauche's lyrics, until 1961, after Loren's October 1960 movie. Another version of the song, by Israeli French performer Maya Casabianca, appeared on France's Billboard chart in September 1961. Additional cover versions have been produced by the Pennies and Kerstin Dahl. At the time of the Mad Men performance, Hills was working as a professional artist and illustrator married to Stewart Young, the manager for AC DC, Cyndi Lauper, and Foreigner. Lionsgate Television released a music download edition of Pare's version at the iTunes Store as well as two vinyl editions made available online. It will also be released in the future on Amazon.com and in stores. This version was produced by Matthew Weiner, Russell Ziecker, David Carbonara, and James T. Hill. Pare recorded her lyrics in a recording studio, working with Carbonara, and choreographed her routine with Marianne Ann Kellogg. The 7 inch vinyl version includes the B side, A Beautiful Mine by RJD2, which is the theme music for the show. Weiner tracked down the song and had many objectives for Pare to achieve in the production of the song. Roughly translated from French to English Zou Bisou Bisou means Oh Kiss Kiss or Oh You Kiss Kiss . The Hills version is described as . . .typical in style of the international ye ye movement , which is much like the go go music genre and was most popular in France, Spain, and Quebec, Mrs. Draper's homeland. The movement's name has phonetic origins, stemming from the exclamation of Yeah Yeah in typical fashion during rock and roll music. After translating the song, Haglund claimed that the theme of the song is about . . .openly declaring and displaying one's love, coming out from 'the bushes' where 'lovers glide stealthily' and feeling love 'everywhere' . The Huffington Post summarized the song more simply saying that it made the statement about how kissing is fun . Slate noted that ye ye singers were often teenage girls who exuded a faux innocent sexuality , which played on Megan Draper's youthful sex appeal and the generation gap between Megan and Don . Pare stated that, Megan, who is younger and more naive than Don, was 'unknowingly putting their intimate connection on the line' in front of their friends and co workers'. . .'The reason that it's so awkward isn't that she was doing anything wrong, but because it's private'. . . Numerous critics from prominent media outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, Slate, USA Today, Rolling Stone, Daily Mail, New York Daily News, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun Times, CBS News, noted that the highlight of the 5th season premiere was Pare's performance of this song during Don Draper's surprise 40th birthday party, describing the performance and Pare as sexy, slinky, and sultry. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone said that Megan sings...for her husband, who can barely suppress his embarrassment and discomfort. Erin Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter described Pare's performance as bizarre, come hither burlesque , noting that she ...stunned partygoers who openly ogled her while the ad exec Jon Hamm squirmed with polite embarrassment. The song's performance became a trending topic on Twitter. Since the song was trending the entire following day, The Roots performed a brief rendition of a verse of the song as interstitial music the following night on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Despite the social media frenzy, the song did not crack the iTunes Top 100. However, it did reach the final position of the Canadian Hot 100.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou%20Bisou%20Bisou
"Bosnian War The Zrinski Battalion Croatian Bojna Zrinski was a special forces unit of the Croatian National Guard Zbor narodne garde ZNG and later of the Croatian Army Hrvatska vojska HV established in Kumrovec on 18 May 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The unit drew personnel from the special police forces and a former French Foreign Legion troops serving as its core. The battalion was set up and initially commanded by Ante Roso, while Major Miljenko Filipovic took over as the commanding officer in August. The Zrinski Battalion trained volunteer troops in Vukovar in June 1991 before it saw action in Hrvatska Kostajnica, the Battle of Gospic and near Slano in 1991. By the end of 1991, the unit's personnel were tasked with setting up an additional special forces unit of the HV. The next year its elements took part in the Battle of Kupres and Operation Tiger aimed at lifting the Siege of Dubrovnik. It also and helped develop and train the Croatian Defence Council Hrvatsko vijece obrane HVO , setting up a training camp in Tomislavgrad. In 1993, the battalion took part in Operation Maslenica. In February 1994, the Zrinski Battalion was amalgamated with several other HV special forces units into the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade 1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug , a component of the 1st Croatian Guards Corps 1. hrvatski gardijski zbor . In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army Jugoslavenska narodna armija JNA believed Croatia would use the Croatian Territorial Defence Force's Teritorijalna obrana TO equipment to build its own army and confront the JNA itself. In order to minimize the expected resistance, the JNA confiscated the TO weapons. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs. In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000 strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions, adopting military organisation. In addition there were 9,00010,000 regionally organised reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons needed to arm many of the troops. Preparations to set up the Croatian National Guard Zbor narodne garde ZNG began on 12 April 1991. Establishment of the ZNG as a police force with military capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA. The ZNG, formally established on 23 April, was tasked with protection of the constitutional order, maintenance of public order, anti terrorist operations, protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, as well as the protection of high value structures and high profile persons. On 18 May 1991, the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG. The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec Special Police Unit SPU . Initially, it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops. The most senior among the former legionnaires was Ante Roso, previously a Sous Officier non commissioned officer NCO in the 4th Foreign Regiment. In consequence, Roso was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander. Major Miljenko Filipovic, likewise a former French Foreign Legion member, was assigned the battalions deputy commander. The unit was based in the village of Kumrovec in the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje, on the grounds of the former Josip Broz Tito political school. The site, adjacent to the border of Slovenia, was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of Slovene or possibly Austrian airspace. In June 1991, the Kumrovec SPU was transferred to Sljeme Peak north of Zagreb leaving Kumrovec base to the Zrinski Battalion, as well as the second special forces unit, the Frankopan Battalion. The Zrinski Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June. It was stationed in Vukovar, tasked with preparation of city defences and organisation of volunteer troops. In August, Filipovic took over command of the battalion from Roso. The same month, the Zrinski Battalion was deployed to the Banovina, where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces out of the town of Hrvatska Kostajnica. In September, the battalion was deployed to Gospic, where it took part in battle to control Gospic against the JNA. Troops assigned to the battalion captured Kaniza barracks in Gospic. During combat in Gospic, 30 troops of the Zrinski Battalion, assisted by Lucko SPU, captured JNA Major General Trajce Krstevski, along with three armoured personnel carriers APCs and 32 soldiers. The unit was deployed to Metkovic on 28 October, tasked with recapturing Slano from the JNA. After the deployment to Gospic, a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there, while the remainder of the unit returned to Kumrovec. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army Hrvatska vojska HV on 3 November 1991. In late 1991, personnel of the Zrinski Battalion set up another special forces unit of the HV the Matija Vlacic Battalion based in Opatija. In 1992, elements of the Zrinski Battalion took part in the Battle of Kupres, before setting up a training camp in the town of Tomislavgrad. There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council Hrvatsko vijece obrane HVO . Later that year, elements of the battalion took part in Operation Tigeraimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik. In 1993, elements of the Zrinski Battalion took part in Operation Maslenica, fighting in the area of Skabrnja. The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the Zrinski Battalion as one of the best units of the HV. On 25 February 1994, the Zrinski Battalion was amalgamated with parts of other special forces units of the HV Frankopan Battalion, Ban Jelacic Battalion, Matija Vlacic Battalion, Ferdo Sucic Battalion and part of 8th Light Assault Brigade forming the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade 1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug , a component of the 1st Croatian Guards Corps 1. hrvatski gardijski zbor , directly subordinated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zrinski%20Battalion
"SMS Zrinyi His Majesty's ship Zrinyi was a Radetzky class pre dreadnought battleship Schlachtschiff of the Austro Hungarian Navy K.u.K. Kriegsmarine , named for the Zrinski, a noble Croatian family. Zrinyi and her sisters, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and Radetzky, were the last pre dreadnoughts built for the Austro Hungarian Navy. During World War I, Zrinyi saw action in the Adriatic Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia as part of the bombardment of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro Hungarian Navy was effectively contained in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrinyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships. With the war going against the Austrians by the end of 1918, Zrinyi was prepared for transfer to the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918, just one day before the end of the war, navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola Pula and surrendered to a squadron of American submarine chasers. Following the handover to the United States Navy, she was briefly designated USS Zrinyi. In the Treaty of Saint Germain en Laye, the transfer was not recognized instead, Zrinyi was given to Italy and broken up for scrap. Zrinyi was built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino dockyard in Trieste, the same place where her sister ships were built earlier. She was laid down on 15 November 1908 and launched from the slipway on 12 April 1910. The teak used on Zrinyi's deck was the only material Austria Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship. The ship was completed by 15 July 1911, and on 22 November 1911 she was commissioned into the fleet. She was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men. Zrinyi was 138.8 m 455 ft 4 in long, and had a beam of 24.6 m 80 ft 8 in and a draft of 8.1 m 26 ft 9 in . She displaced 14,508 long tons 14,741 t normally, and up to 15,845 long tons 16,099 t with a full combat load. She was powered by two shaft four cylinder vertical triple expansion engines rated at 19,800 indicated horsepower. The ship had a top speed of 20.5 knots 38.0 km h 23.6 mph . Zrinyi was the first warship in the Austro Hungarian Navy to use fuel oil to supplement her 12 Yarrow type coal fired boilers. She had a maximum range of 4,000 nautical miles 7,400 km 4,600 mi at a cruising speed of 10 knots 19 km h 12 mph . The ship's primary armament consisted of four 30.5 cm 12 in 45 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets. This was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight 24 cm 9.4 in guns in four wing turrets. The tertiary battery consisted of twenty 10 cm L 50 guns in casemated single mounts, four 47 mm 1.9 in 1.85 in L 44 and one 47 mm L 33 quick firing guns. Furthermore, the ship's boats were equipped with two 66 mm 2.6 in L 18 landing guns for operations ashore. After 191617 refits four Skoda 7 cm K16 anti aircraft guns were installed. Three 45 cm 17.7 in torpedo tubes were also carried, one on each broadside and one in the stern. The ship was assigned to the Austro Hungarian Fleet's 1st Battle Squadron after her 1911 commissioning. In 1912, Zrinyi and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern Mediterranean Sea. On the second cruise into the Aegean Sea, conducted from November to December, Zrinyi and her sister ships were accompanied by the cruiser SMS Admiral Spaun and a pair of destroyers. After returning to Pola, the entire fleet mobilized for possible hostilities, as tensions flared in the Balkans. In 1913, Zrinyi participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars. Ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the British pre dreadnought HMS King Edward VII, the Italian pre dreadnought Ammiraglio di Saint Bon, the French armored cruiser Edgar Quinet, and the German light cruiser SMS Breslau. The most important action of the combined flotilla, which was under the command of British Admiral Cecil Burney, was to blockade the Montenegrin coast. The goal of the blockade was to prevent Serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at Scutari, where Montenegro had besieged a combined force of Albanians and Ottomans. Pressured by the international blockade, Serbia withdrew its army from Scutari, which was subsequently occupied by a joint Allied ground force. During that year, the first of four new dreadnoughts, SMS Viribus Unitis, that made up the Tegetthoff classthe only dreadnoughts built for the Austro Hungarian Navycame into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, Zrinyi and her sisters were moved from the 1st Division to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron. At the time of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914, the battleships in the Austro Hungarian Navy consisted of the Radetzky class, the Tegetthoff class which still had one ship, SMS Szent Istvan, under construction , the Erzherzog Karl class and finally, the older Habsburg class. Along with the remainder of the Austro Hungarian Navy, Zrinyi was mobilized in late July 1914 to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau. The two German ships broke out of Messina, which was surrounded by the British navy and reached Turkey. The flotilla had advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy when news of the successful breakout reached Vienna. The Austro Hungarian ships were then recalled before seeing action. On 23 May 1915, between two and four hours after news of the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro Hungarian naval base at Pola, Zrinyi and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the Italian and Montenegrin coast. Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro. The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia, who were members of the Entente, during the first half of 1915. The attack on Ancona was an immense success, and the ships were unopposed during the operation. The bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an Italian steamer in the port of Ancona itself, and an Italian destroyer, Turbine, was severely damaged further south. On the shore, the infrastructure of the port of Ancona, as well as the surrounding towns, were severely damaged. The railroad yard in Ancona, as well as the port facilities in the town, were damaged or destroyed. The local shore batteries were also suppressed. During the bombardment, Zrinyi also helped to destroy a train, a railway station, and a bridge at Senigallia. Additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves, warehouses, oil tanks, radio stations, and the local barracks. Sixty three Italians, both civilians and military personnel, were killed in the bombardment. By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene, the Austro Hungarians were safely back in Pola. The objective of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces along the border with Austria Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts. Aside from the attack on Ancona, the Austro Hungarian battleships were largely confined to Pola for the duration of the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Zrinyi and the rest of the Austro Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus followed a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies. After the Austro Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1918, the Austrians wanted to turn the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs later to become a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in order to prevent the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war. However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships. The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left Pola along with her sister ship, Radetzky. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato also known as Split . They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of United States Navy USN submarine chasers in the area did. She had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, Korvettenkapitan Marijan Polic, who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato Split in Dalmatia. Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS Zrinyi and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command. The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted menthe latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel. The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on. Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920. On the morning of 7 November 1920, Zrinyi was decommissioned. USS Chattanooga took her in tow and, assisted by Brooks and Hovey, towed the battleship to Italy. Under the terms of the treaties of Versailles and St. Germain, Zrinyi was ultimately turned over to the Italian government at Venice. She was broken up for scrap later that year and into 1921.

"HMS Zubian was a First World War Royal Navy Tribal class destroyer constructed from the forward end of HMS Zulu and the rear and mid sections of HMS Nubian. These two destroyers had been badly damaged in late 1916, and rather than scrapping both hulls at the height of World War I, the Admiralty ordered that they be rebuilt as the composite Zubian and put back into service. She was commissioned into the fleet in June 1917. The name Zubian is a portmanteau of the names of the original ships. Zubian saw extensive service in the final two years of the war as part of the Dover Patrol. She sank the German U boat UC 50 in February 1918, while she was on patrol in the English Channel. In late April, she participated in the First Ostend Raid as an escort for the bombardment force. After the war, Zubian was sold for scrap and broken up by December 1919. Zubian was 85.4 metres 280 ft long overall, with a beam of 8.2 m 27 ft and a draught of 3 m 9.8 ft . She displaced 1,040 metric tons 1,020 long tons 1,150 short tons . The ship's propulsion system consisted of three Parsons steam turbines, which were powered by six oil fired Thornycroft boilers. These provided 14,000 shaft horsepower 10,000 kW and a top speed of 33 knots 61 km h 38 mph . She was armed with two QF 4 inch Mk V guns and two 18 inch 450 mm torpedo tubes. One gun was mounted on the forecastle and the other on the stern, with the two torpedo tubes amidships. Her crew numbered 68 officers and enlisted. In late 1916, two British destroyers of the 6th Flotilla in the Dover PatrolNubian and Zuluwere badly damaged by German attacks in the English Channel. Nubian's bow had been destroyed by a torpedo from a German torpedo boat on 26 October in the Battle of Dover Strait, while Zulu had her stern blown off by a mine in the Channel on 8 November, and was towed to Calais. Both wrecks were then towed to Chatham Dockyard, where a complete destroyer was constructed by joining the foreparts of Zulu with the stern of Nubian, and despite a 3.5 inches 89 mm difference in beam, the unique operation was successful. The ship was renamed Zubian by Admiral Reginald Bacon, the commander of the Dover Patrol. The hybrid destroyer was commissioned on 7 June 1917. The choice of name caused confusion among the German Imperial Admiralty Staff, who knew of no such ship under construction. Zubian joined the 6th Flotilla and served there until the end of the war. During this period, Zubian and the rest of the Flotilla rotated through nighttime patrols of the Dover Strait in groups of four, supported by flotilla leaders these patrols were intended to catch German torpedo boats that were conducting night bombardments of Allied positions in the Channel. While in the Dover Strait on 4 February 1918, she encountered the mine laying U boat UC 50, which was surfaced about 400 yards 370 m off Zubian's port bow with her radio antennae up. Zubian attempted to ram the submarine but the Germans managed to submerge. The destroyer then dropped depth charges over the submerged U boat and a significant amount of oil and wreckage was observed thereafter. Zubian marked the location with a buoy and an hour later, the patrol vessel HMS P12 dropped additional depth charges there. Trawlers later located an object that divers confirmed was UC 50. Zubian also participated in the First Ostend Raid two months later on the night of 2324 April. The attack was intended to close the German held ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge, which were being used as bases for the U boats. Zubian was assigned to the bombardment force, and along with the destroyers Mentor and Lightfoot, provided the close escort for a group of six monitors. The bombardment unit was covered by the Harwich Force in the Channel. The bombardment force was tasked with suppressing the German coastal defences, while a pair of old cruisers attempted to steam into the harbour entrances, where they would be sunk as blockships. The effort failed when both cruisers ran aground far outside of the harbour. Worn out by heavy wartime use, Zubian was sold in the immediate post war draw down and broken up for scrap by December 1919.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20Zubian
"Zubir Said BBM 22 July 1907 16 November 1987 was a Singaporean composer originally from the Minangkabau highlands of Indonesia who composed the national anthem of Singapore, Majulah Singapura Onward Singapore . A self taught musician, Zubir also worked as a score arranger and songwriter for Cathay Keris Film Productions for 12 years, composing numerous songs for the company's Malay films. He is believed to have written about 1,500 songs, with less than 10 of them ever recorded. It has been said that Zubir was viewed by many as a composer with a true Malay soul , as his songs were interwoven with historical messages and Malay truisms, and that he and his Minangkabau contemporaries awoke a wave of national consciousness in the 1950s. The eldest child in a family of three boys and five girls, Zubir Said was born on 22 July 1907 in Bukittinggi formerly known as Fort De Kock in the Minangkabau highlands of West Sumatra, Indonesia. His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in. In 1928 at the age of 21, Zubir went to Singapore to make a living as a musician, taking up the suggestion of a sailor friend who had described the island as a place of glittering lights, kopi susu and butter . This was done in the face of objections from his village chieftain father, Mohamad Said bin Sanang, who believed music to be against religion. Zubir's first job was as a musician with City Opera, a bangsawan or Malay opera troupe. He became the troupe's bandleader. Thereafter, in 1936, he joined the recording company His Master's Voice. Zubir went to Java to marry Tarminah Kario Wikromo, a keroncong singer, in 1938 they returned to Zubir's home town of Bukittinggi in 1941 just before the outbreak of World War II. Coming back to Singapore in 1947, Zubir worked as a part time photographer with the Utusan Melayu newspaper while composing and performing music and songs. In 1949 he took up the post of orchestra conductor at Shaw Brothers' Malay Film Production, and in 1952 he joined Cathay Keris Film Productions as a score arranger and songwriter for the company's Malay films, including Sumpah Pontianak Blood of Pontianak, 1958 and Chuchu Datuk Merah Grandchildren of Datuk Merah, 1963 . In 1957, he received his first public recognition when his songs were performed at the Victoria Theatre. Singapore, then a British colony, had been conferred city status by a royal charter from King George VI in 1951. In 1958, the City Council of Singapore approached Zubir to compose a song for the city to be titled Majulah Singapura , which was a motto to be displayed in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation. Zubir's song, Majulah Singapura Onward Singapore , was first performed by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre on 6 September 1958 to celebrate its official reopening. When Singapore attained self government in 1959, the Government felt that a national anthem was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. It decided that the City Council's song, which was already popular, would serve this purpose. After some revisions were made to the song, it was adopted by the Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959, and on 30 November the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed. This statute regulated the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem. Majulah Singapura was presented to the nation on 3 December at the launch of Loyalty Week , replacing the colonial anthem God Save the Queen . After Singapore's full independence from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Majulah Singapura was formally adopted as the Republic's national anthem. In a 1984 oral history interview, to sum up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung You should hold up the sky of the land where you live . In 1962, Zubir's songs for the movie Dang Anom won an award at the Ninth Asian Film Festival in Seoul, South Korea. He continued working for Cathay Keris Film Productions until he retired in 1964, composing numerous songs for Malay films. He also gave music lessons, and often had other music artists visiting him to talk about music and asking for advice. His third and youngest daughter Puan Sri Dr. Rohana Zubir, a retired lecturer with the University of Malaya, recalled how the family home in Singapore was always filled with music. He was the heart of the conversation, very enthused and willing to share pearls of wisdom so that others could benefit from his work. This generosity extended to other areas of his life. He helped his own family in Sumatra and families in Singapore he had adopted , sending them medicine and other items with what little he could afford, even though his own family was not well off at the time. Zubir said he was never driven by money. He believed that money was essential for his survival and to look after the family, and that the money he earned from giving music lessons and his compositions for the film world sufficed. He valued honesty and sincerity in his work and placed importance on purity and originality, whether in his music, lyrics or style of singing. He stopped composing songs for the film company when he was upset about the management's decision to cut production costs by borrowing existing music to be used for dubbing on to the background music of some films. Zubir died at the age of 80 on 16 November 1987 at Joo Chiat Place in Singapore, survived by four daughters and a son. Despite his legacy, Zubir left only S 20,000 to his name and the family had no home to call its own. In 1990 Zubir's life and passion as a musician were documented in a book titled Zubir Said His Songs, and in 2004 a S 20,000 bronze bust of a bespectacled Zubir was installed in Gallery 6 of the Malay Heritage Centre which pays tribute to icons in Malay arts and culture. Zubir receives dozens of awards and honours from in and outside of Singapore for his massive contributions to the Malay world in songs and music and to Singapore. Some of his awards and honours were not in the list below. In recognition of his contributions to the State, Zubir was conferred the Sijil Kemuliaan Certificate of Honour on 16 March 1963 and the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat Public Service Star in the same year. In 1971, he received the Jasawan Seni cultural medallion award from eight Malay cultural organisations, and the Asean Cultural and Communications Award in 1987. He also received a Certificate of Commendation from the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees AUPE for composing the AUPE song. In 1995, Zubir was posthumously given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore COMPASS . On 8 May 2009 the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Rear Admiral NS Lui Tuck Yew, announced that the address of the permanent campus for the School of the Arts Sota near The Cathay will be 1 Zubir Said Drive, in honour of the late composer. Zubir is primarily remembered for composing Singapore's national anthem, Majulah Singapura Onward Singapore . The Malay lyrics exhort Singaporeans to progress towards happiness together Sama sama menuju bahagia so that their noble aspiration bring Singapore success Cita cita kita yang mulia Berjaya Singapura , and to unite in a new spirit Marilah kita bersatu Dengan semangat yang baru . In 1956, he also submitted three song compositions to the Malayan later Malaysian Government for consideration for their national anthem. However, a different song, Negaraku , was selected in the end. Zubir is also remembered for his composition Semoga Bahagia May You Achieve Happiness which was aimed at primary school students, advising them to work hard for their future. It has become a Children's Day song for Singaporean children, and is thus often sung in schools on 1 October. It is also performed during the Singapore Youth Festival. Zubir is estimated to have written about 1,500 songs, including those written for Cathay Keris Film Productions' Malay films in the 1950s and 1960s. Less than 10 of these songs were recorded. On 22 August 2007, Zubir's family signed an agreement with Universal Music in Malaysia for the latter to manage his works. The copyright in the songs remains with his family. The idea to do so came after his daughter Dr. Rohana met Sandy Monteiro, senior vice president Asean of the Universal Music Publishing Group in 2005 through Monteiro's wife, who was a good friend of hers. Dr. Rohana was reported as saying It is time to hand over the songs in order to revive them two decades after my father's passing. I hope to ensure that his songs continue to live in the hearts of young artists in Malaysia. It is said that Zubir was viewed by many as a composer with a true Malay soul , as his songs, traditional but yet modern and patriotic, were interwoven with historical messages and Malay truisms. Journalist A. Samad Ismail commented that Zubir and his Minangkabau contemporaries awoke a wave of national consciousness in the 1950s.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubir%20Said
"Zuiho , Auspicious Phoenix or Fortunate Phoenix was the name ship of her class of two light aircraft carriers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Originally laid down as the submarine tender Takasaki, she was renamed and converted while under construction into an aircraft carrier. The ship was completed during the first year of World War II and played a minor role in the Battle of Midway in mid 1942. She participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign during the rest of 1942. Significantly damaged during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in that campaign, after repairs Zuiho covered the evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal in early 1943. Her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid to late 1943 and used from land bases in a series of battles in the Southwest Pacific. Zuiho participated in the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in mid 1944. In this last engagement, she mainly served as a decoy for the main striking forces and was sunk by American aircraft. In between battles, the ship served as an aircraft ferry and a training ship. The submarine support ship Takasaki was laid down on 20 June 1935 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and was designed to be converted to either a fleet oiler or a light aircraft carrier as needed. She was launched on 19 June 1936 and began a lengthy conversion into a carrier while fitting out. The ship was renamed Zuiho during the process which was not completed until 27 December 1940 when she was commissioned. After her conversion, Zuiho had a length of 205.5 meters 674 ft 2 in overall. She had a beam of 18.2 meters 59 ft 8 in and a draft of 6.6 meters 21 ft 7 in . She displaced 11,443 metric tons 11,262 long tons at standard load. Her original diesel engines were intended to give her a top speed of 29 knots 54 km h 33 mph , but they were replaced by a pair of geared steam turbine sets as part of her conversion. Each turbine set drove one propeller using steam provided by four water tube boilers. The turbines produced a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower 39,000 kW which gave Zuiho a maximum speed of 28 knots 52 km h 32 mph . She carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of 7,800 nautical miles 14,400 km 9,000 mi at a speed of 18 knots 33 km h 21 mph . Her crew numbered 785 officers and men. Zuiho was a flush deck design and lacked an island superstructure. Her flight deck was 180 meters 590 ft 6 in long and had a maximum width of 23 meters 75 ft 6 in . The ship was built with a single hangar 120 meters 406 ft 10 in long and 18 meters 59 ft wide, intended to house 30 aircraft. The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline aircraft elevators. She had arresting gear with six cables, but was not fitted with an aircraft catapult. The ship's primary armament consisted of eight 12.7 centimeter 5 in Type 89 dual purpose guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. Zuiho was also initially equipped with four twin 25 millimeter 1 in Type 96 light anti aircraft AA guns, also in sponsons along the sides of the hull. In 1943, her light AA armament was increased to forty eight 25 mm guns. The following year, an additional twenty 25 mm guns were added in addition to six 28 round AA rocket launchers. After commissioning, Zuiho remained in Japanese waters until late 1941. Captain Sueo Obayashi assumed command on 20 September and Zuiho became flagship of the Third Carrier Division ten days later. She was briefly assigned to the 11th Air Fleet in Formosa on 13 October and arrived in Takao the following day. The ship returned to Japan in early November, rejoining the Third Carrier Division, and was given a brief refit later in the month. Together with the carrier Hosho and six battleships, Zuiho covered the return of the ships of the 1st Air Fleet Kido Butai as they returned from the attack on Pearl Harbor in mid December. In February 1942, the ship ferried Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters to Davao City, Philippines for the 11th Air Fleet. Transferred to the First Fleet after the Third Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 April, Zuiho remained in Japanese waters until June when she participated in the Battle of Midway. She was assigned to the Main Body of the invasion force and her aircraft complement consisted of six Mitsubishi A5M Claude and six A6M2 Zero fighters, and twelve Nakajima B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers. After the initial American airstrikes that sank three Japanese carriers, the Main Body was ordered to rendezvous with the Kido Butai at high speed, but this order was cancelled later that evening. Late on 5 June, the fighters of her combat air patrol drove off an American Consolidated PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft of VP 44 that had spotted the Main Body. Zuiho was ordered the following afternoon to prepare to launch an airstrike, together with aircraft from the seaplane tender Nisshin, on the carriers that the Japanese imagined were pursuing them, but this was cancelled on the morning of 7 June when it became clear that there was no pursuit. After a brief refit in JulyAugust in Sasebo, the ship was assigned to the First Carrier Division with the carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku on 12 August. The division sailed to Truk on 1 October to support Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign and departed from Truk 10 days later based on the promise of the Imperial Japanese Army to capture Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. At this time, Zuiho carried eighteen A6Ms and six B5Ns. The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October at the opening of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and each side launched airstrikes. The aircraft passed each other en route and nine of Zuiho's Zeros attacked the aircraft launched by the aircraft carrier Enterprise. They shot down three Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and three Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own. Two of Enterprise's Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers hit Zuiho with 500 pound 230 kg bombs and put her flight deck out of action, although she was not seriously damaged otherwise. Together with the damaged Shokaku, the ship withdrew from the battle and reached Truk two days later. After temporary repairs, the two carriers returned to Japan in early November and Zuiho's repairs were completed on 16 December. In the meantime, Captain Bunjiro Yamaguchi assumed command. The ship left Kure on 17 January 1943 and sailed for Truk with a load of aircraft. Upon arrival she was assigned to the Second Carrier Division with the carriers Jun'yo and Zuikaku to provide cover for the evacuation of Guadalcanal. Zuiho's fighters were transferred to Wewak, New Guinea, in mid February and then to Kavieng in early March, although the ship remained at Truk. They flew to Rabaul on mid March to participate in Operation I Go, a land based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The fighters returned to Truk on 18 March after claiming 18 Allied aircraft shot down. Zuiho arrived at Sasebo on 9 May and received a brief refit in mid June. She returned to Truk on 15 July and remained in the area until 5 November when she returned to Yokosuka. Her air group, 18 Zeros and 8 D3As, was briefly deployed to Kavieng in late August early September before returning to Truk. By this time, Zuiho was assigned to the First Carrier Division with Shokaku and Zuikaku and they sailed for Eniwetok Atoll on 18 September for training a secondary objective was to be in position to intercept any attacks by American carriers in the vicinity of Wake Island and the Marshall Islands area. That day the American carriers raided the Gilbert Islands and were gone by the time the Japanese reached Eniwetok on 20 September. Japanese intelligence reports pointed to another American attack in the Wake Marshall Islands area in mid October and Admiral Mineichi Koga sortied the Combined Fleet, including the First Carrier Division, on 17 October. They arrived at Eniwetok two days later and waited for reports of American activity until 23 October. They then sailed for Wake Island and then returned to Truk on 26 October without encountering any American ships. Zuiho's air group was transferred to Rabaul at the beginning of November, just in time to participate in the raid on Rabaul a few days later. The fighters claimed to have shot down 25 American aircraft at the cost of eight pilots the survivors flew back to Truk and remained ashore. On 30 November, Zuiho, together with the escort carriers Chuyo and Unyo, departed Truk for Japan, escorted by four destroyers. The Americans had cracked the Japanese naval codes and positioned several submarines along their route to Yokosuka. Skate unsuccessfully attacked Zuiho on 30 November, while Sailfish torpedoed and sank Chuyo five days later with heavy loss of life. From December to May 1944, Zuiho ferried aircraft and supplies to Truk and Guam although she was reassigned to the Third Carrier Division on 29 January, together with the converted carriers Chitose and Chiyoda. Each of the three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers, but this plan was changed on 15 February to a consolidated air group, the 653rd, that controlled the aircraft of all three carriers. While fully equipped with 18 Zero fighters, 45 Zero fighter bombers, 18 B5Ns, and 9 Nakajima B6N Jill torpedo bombers by May, the air group's pilots were largely drawn from the two most recent classes of flight school graduates and lacked experience. The ship sailed for Tawi Tawi on 11 May in the Philippines. The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack. However, the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage. The 1st Mobile Fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June. The Americans failed to locate Ozawa's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his airstrikes early the following morning. He had deployed his forces in a T shaped formation with the Third Carrier Division at the end of the stem, 115 nautical miles 213 km 132 mi ahead of the First and Second Carrier Divisions that formed the crossbar of the T . Zuiho and her consorts were intended to draw the attention of the Americans while the other carriers conducted their airstrikes without disruption. Sixteen Aichi E13A floatplanes were launched by the heavy cruisers accompanying the carriers at 04 30 to search for the Americans the three carriers launched a follow up wave of 13 B5Ns at 05 20. The first wave spotted one group of four carriers from Task Force 58 at 07 34 and the Japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later. This consisted of 43 Zero fighter bombers and 7 B6Ns, escorted by 14 A6M5 fighters the carriers retained only 3 fighters, 2 fighter bombers, 2 B6Ns and 2 B5Ns for self defense and later searches. While the airstrike was still forming up, the second wave of searchers located Task Force 58's battleships and the airstrike was diverted to attack them. The Americans detected the incoming Japanese aircraft at 09 59 and had a total of 199 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters in the air by the time the Japanese aircraft were in range of the American ships. The defending fighters decimated the Japanese aircraft and only 21 survived. The only damage inflicted was from one A6M2 that hit the battleship South Dakota in her superstructure with a single 250 kilogram 550 lb bomb that wounded 50 crewmen, but did little other damage. Only 3 Hellcats were lost in the affair, 1 to a B6N, although the Japanese claimed four victories. Some of the surviving Japanese aircraft landed at Guam while others, including the 5 surviving B6Ns, returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit. At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel, while the Americans turned west to close the distance. Both sides launched aircraft the next day to locate each other Zuiho launched three aircraft at 12 00 to search east of the fleet, but they did not find the Americans. The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an airstrike launched. While their attack sank the carrier Hiyo and damaged two others, Zuiho escaped unscathed and successfully disengaged that evening. By the end of the battle, Ozawa only had 34 aircraft intact. After reaching Japan on 1 July, the ship remained in Japanese waters until October, training replacements for her air group. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, prepared various contingency plans Sho Go 1 1 Sho ichigo sakusen was a major naval operation in the Philippines, while Sho Go 2 was intended to defend Formosa, the Ryukyu Islands and southern Kyushu. He activated Sho Go 2 after the Americans attacked the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October. This required the transfer of most of the 653rd Naval Air Group to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of the 653rd's aircraft were fruitlessly destroyed when the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion. On 17 October Toyoda alerted the fleet that Sho Go 1 was imminent and activated the plan the following day after receiving reports of the landings on Leyte. Under the plan, Zuiho and the rest of Ozawa's carrier force were to approach Leyte Gulf from the north as a diversion from two other forces approaching from the south and west, with all three forces converging on the gulf on 25 October the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. As decoys, the carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft 52 A6M5 fighters, 28 A6M2 fighter bombers, 7 Yokosuka D4Y Judy dive bombers, 26 B6Ns and 4 B5Ns. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa ordered an airstrike launched to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon. Preoccupied with the other Japanese naval forces and land based air attacks, the Americans could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They were spotted at 16 05, but Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day in what came to be called the Battle of Cape Engano. Aircraft from the light carrier Independence were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an airstrike of 60 Hellcats, 65 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avengers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet. They spotted them at 07 35 and brushed aside the 13 Zeros that the Japanese had retained for self defense. Zuiho attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft, but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo carrying Avengers missed. The 500 pound 230 kg bomb started several small fires, lifted the rear elevator, bulged the flight deck, knocked out steering and gave the ship a small list to port. Twenty minutes later, the fires were put out, steering repaired and the list corrected. A second attack an hour later focused on Chiyoda and ignored Zuiho. The third wave arrived around 13 00 and badly damaged the ship. She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs, although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room. Zuiho was forced to reduce speed to 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 14 10. The ship took on a 13 list to starboard and went dead in the water at 14 45 when the port engine room fully flooded. The fourth wave of American aircraft attacked ten minutes later, but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses. This was enough to increase her list to 23 and she was ordered abandoned at 15 10. Zuiho sank at 15 26 at position 1920N 12515E 19.333N 125.250E 19.333 125.250Coordinates 1920N 12515E 19.333N 125.250E 19.333 125.250 with the loss of 7 officers and 208 men. The destroyer Kuwa and the battleship Ise rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese%20aircraft%20carrier%20Zuih%C5%8D
"The Zuiho class also known as the Shoho class was a group of two aircraft carriers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy before World War II. Both ships were originally built as submarine tenders, but were subsequently converted into carriers. Completed in early 1942, Shoho supported the invasion forces in Operation MO, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea, and was sunk by American carrier aircraft on her first combat operation during the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May. Shoho was the first Japanese aircraft carrier to be sunk during World War II. Zuiho played a secondary role in the Battle of Midway in mid 1942 and did not engage any American aircraft or ships during the battle. The ship participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign during the rest of 1942. She was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands during this campaign and covered the evacuation of Japanese forces from the island in early 1943 after repairs. Afterwards, her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid to late 1943 and used from land bases in a number of battles in the South West Pacific. Zuiho participated in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in mid 1944. In this last battle, Zuiho mainly served as a decoy for the main striking forces and she was finally sunk by American aircraft fulfilling her task. In between engagements, the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship. In the mid 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to build a class of two submarine tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940. In early 1941, Tsurugizaki was taken out of service, converted to an aircraft carrier, and recommissioned as Shoho in early 1942. After their conversion, the ships had a length of 205.5 meters 674 ft 2 in overall. They had a beam of 18.2 m 59 ft 8 in and a draft of 6.58 m 21 ft 7 in . They displaced 11,443 tonnes 11,262 long tons at standard load. As part of their conversion, their original diesel engines, which had given them a top speed of 29 knots 54 km h 33 mph , were replaced by a pair of destroyer type geared steam turbine sets with a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower 39,000 kW , each driving one propeller. Steam was provided by four Kampon water tube boilers and they now had a maximum speed of 28 knots 52 km h 32 mph . The boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard funnel and the ships carried 2,642 tonnes 2,600 long tons of fuel oil, giving them a range of 7,800 nautical miles 14,400 km 9,000 mi at a speed of 18 knots 33 km h 21 mph . Their crew numbered 785 officers and men. Their flight deck was 180 m 590 ft 6 in long and had a maximum width of 23 m 75 ft 6 in . The ships were designed with a single hangar 124 m 406 ft 10 in long and 18 m 59 ft wide. The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline aircraft elevators. The forward elevator was 13 by 12 meters 42 ft 8 in 39 ft 4 in in size and the smaller rear elevator measured 12 by 10.8 meters 39 ft 4 in 35 ft 5 in . The ships had arresting gear with six cables, but they were not fitted with an aircraft catapult. The Zuiho class carriers were a flush deck design and lacked an island superstructure. They were designed to operate 30 aircraft. The primary armament consisted of eight 40 caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 anti aircraft AA guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. They fired 23.45 kilogram 51.7 lb projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 700725 m s 2,3002,380 ft s at 45, this provided a maximum range of 14,800 meters 16,200 yd , and a maximum ceiling of 9,400 meters 30,800 ft . The ships were also initially equipped with four twin 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns, also in sponsons along the sides of the hull. They fired .25 kilogram 0.55 lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 900 m s 3,000 ft s at 50, this provided a maximum range of 7,500 meters 8,202 yd , and an effective ceiling of 5,500 meters 18,000 ft . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen round magazines. In 1943, Zuiho's light AA armament was increased to 48 twenty five mm guns. The following year, an additional twenty 25 mm guns were added in addition to six 28 round AA rocket launchers. Each 12 centimeter 4.7 in rocket weighed 22.5 kilograms 50 lb and had a maximum velocity of 200 m s 660 ft s . Their maximum range was 4,800 meters 5,200 yd . After commissioning, Zuiho remained in Japanese waters until late 1941, becoming the flagship of the Third Carrier Division on 30 September. Together with the carrier Hosho and eight battleships, Zuiho covered the return of the ships of the 1st Air Fleet as they returned from the Attack on Pearl Harbor in mid December. Aside from one trip to transport aircraft to the Philippines, she remained in Japanese waters until June 1942. While still fitting out, Shoho was assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet on 22 December 1941. On 4 February 1942, she ferried aircraft to Truk, where she remained until 11 April before returning to Yokosuka. In late April 1942, Shoho was assigned to Operation MO and arrived in Truk on 29 April. The following day, she departed Truk in company with four heavy cruisers and they formed the Main Force of the operation. Due to aircraft shortages, her aircraft complement consisted of only four obsolete Mitsubishi A5M Claude and eight modern Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighters plus six Nakajima B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers. Covering the other elements of Operation MO was the Striking Force that consisted of the fleet carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku. After covering the landings on Tulagi on 3 May, Shoho headed north to cover the invasion convoy the next day and was not present when aircraft from the American carrier Yorktown attacked Japanese shipping at Tulagi. This air strike confirmed that at least one American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had no idea of its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. US Army Air Force USAAF aircraft spotted Shoho southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher received Magic intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation MO near Bougainville, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling his ships on 6 May and move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea to be in a position to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May. American reconnaissance aircraft reported two Japanese heavy cruisers northeast of Misima Island in the Louisiade Archipelago off the eastern tip of New Guinea at 0735 and two carriers at 0815 on 7 May. An hour later Fletcher ordered an airstrike launched, believing that the two carriers reported were Shokaku and Zuikaku. Lexington and Yorktown launched a total of 53 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 22 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers escorted by 18 F4F Wildcats. The 0815 report turned out to be miscoded, as the pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers, but USAAF aircraft had spotted Shoho, her escorts and the invasion convoy in the meantime. As the latest spot report plotted only 30 nautical miles 56 km 35 mi away from the 0815 report, the aircraft en route were diverted to this new target. Shoho and the rest of the Main Force were spotted by aircraft from Lexington at 1040. At this time, Shoho's combat air patrol CAP consisted of two A5Ms and one A6M Zero. The first dive bomber attacks all missed and the CAP shot down one Dauntless after it had dropped its bomb. The second squadron of Dauntlesses followed shortly afterwards and they hit Shoho twice with 1,000 pound 450 kg bombs. These penetrated the ship's flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later the Devastators of VT 2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit Shoho five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power. In addition, the hits flooded both engine and boiler rooms. Yorktown's aircraft delivered the coup de grace with another eleven hits from 1000 pound bombs in addition to two more torpedo hits. After his attack, Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon, commander of VS 2, radioed his famous message to the American carriers Scratch one flat top Shoho was ordered abandoned at 1131 and sank four minutes later. Some 300 men successfully abandoned the ship, but they had to await rescue as the remaining ships of the Main Force headed north at high speed to avoid any further airstrikes. Around 1400, the destroyer Sazanami returned to the scene and rescued only 203 survivors, the rest of her crew of 834 died during the attack or in the water awaiting rescue. Shoho was the first Japanese aircraft carrier lost during the war. Zuiho led the Support Fleet during the Battle of Midway and did not engage American carriers directly. Her aircraft complement consisted of six Mitsubishi A5M Claude and six Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighters, and twelve Nakajima B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers. After a brief refit in JulyAugust, the ship was assigned to First Carrier Division with Shokaku and Zuikaku on 12 August. The division sailed to Truk on 1 October to support Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign and left Truk on 11 October based on the promise of the Japanese Army to capture Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. At this time, Zuiho carried 18 A6Ms and 6 B5Ns. The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and each side launched air strikes. The aircraft passed each other en route and nine of Zuiho's Zeros attacked the aircraft launched by the USS Enterprise. They shot down three each Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own. Two of Enterprise's Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers hit Zuiho with 500 pound 230 kg bombs and damaged her flight deck enough that she could not conduct flight operations although she was not seriously damaged otherwise. Together with the damaged Shokaku, the ship withdrew from the battle and reached Truk two days later. After temporary repairs, the two carriers returned to Japan in early November and Zuiho's repairs were completed on 16 December. The ship left Kure on 17 January 1943 and sailed for Truk with a load of aircraft. Upon arrival she was assigned to the Second Carrier Division to provide cover for the evacuation of Guadalcanal, along with Jun'yo and Zuikaku, later in the month and in early February. Zuiho arrived at Sasebo on 9 May and received a brief refit in mid June. She returned to Truk on 15 July and remained in the area until 5 November when she returned to Yokosuka. By this time, Zuiho was assigned to the First Carrier Division with Shokaku and Zuikaku and they sailed for Eniwetok Atoll on 18 September for training and to be in position to intercept any attacks by American carriers in the vicinity of Wake Island and the Marshall Islands area. That day the American carriers raided the Gilbert Islands and were gone by the time the Japanese reached Eniwetok on 20 September. On 30 November, Zuiho, together with the escort carriers Chuyo and Unyo, departed Truk for Japan, escorted by four destroyers. The Americans had cracked the Japanese naval codes and positioned several submarines along their route to Yokosuka. Skate unsuccessfully attacked Zuiho on 30 November, while Sailfish torpedoed and sank Chuyo five days later with heavy loss of life. From December to May 1944, Zuiho ferried aircraft and supplies to Truk and Guam although she was reassigned to the Third Carrier Division on 29 January, together with the converted carriers Chitose and Chiyoda. Each of the three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers, but this plan was changed on 15 February to a consolidated air group, the 653rd, that controlled the aircraft of all three carriers. While fully equipped by May with 18 Zero fighters, 45 Zero fighter bombers, 18 B5Ns, and 9 Nakajima B6N Jill torpedo bombers, the air group's pilots were largely drawn from the two most recent classes and lacked experience. The ship sailed for Tawi Tawi on 11 May in the Philippines. The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack. However, the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage. The 1st Mobile Fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June. The Americans failed to locate Ozawa's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning. He had deployed his forces in a T shaped formation with the 3rd Carrier Division at the end of the stem, 115 nautical miles 213 km 132 mi ahead of the 1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions that formed the crossbar of the T . Zuiho and her consorts were intended to draw the attentions of the Americans while the other carriers conducted their air strikes without disruption. The first wave of search aircraft spotted one group of four carriers from Task Force 58 at 0734 and the Japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later. This consisted of 43 Zero fighter bombers and 7 B6Ns, escorted by 14 A6M5 fighters the carriers retained only three fighters, two fighter bombers, two B6Ns and two B5Ns for self defense and later searches. While the air strike was still forming up, the second wave of searchers located Task Force 58's battleships and the air strike was diverted to attack them. The Americans detected the incoming Japanese aircraft and had a total of 199 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters in the air by the time the Japanese aircraft were in range of the American ships. The defending fighters decimated the Japanese aircraft and only 21 survived, doing little damage to the American ships. Some of the surviving Japanese aircraft landed at Guam while others, including the five surviving B6Ns, returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit. At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. Both sides launched aircraft the next day to locate each other Zuiho launched three aircraft at 1200 to search east of the fleet, but they did not discover the Americans. The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. While they sank one Japanese carrier and damaged two others, Zuiho was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening. By the end of the battle, Air Group 653 was reduced to two Zero fighters, three Zero fighter bombers and six torpedo bombers. After reaching Japan on 1 July, the ship remained in Japanese waters until October, training replacements for her air group. After the Americans attacked the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their plan for the defense of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion. On 18 October, Admiral Soemu Toyoda activated the naval portion of the defense plan after receiving reports of the landings on Leyte. Zuiho's role, together with Chiyoda, Chitose, Zuikaku and the rest of the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, approaching Leyte Gulf from the north, was to serve as decoys to attraction away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. As decoys, the carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft 52 Zero fighters, 28 Zero fighter bombers, 7 Yokosuka D4Y Judy dive bombers, 26 B6N and 4 B5N torpedo bombers. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Admiral Ozawa ordered an air strike launched to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them at 1605, but Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day in what came to be called the Battle of Cape Engano. American aircraft were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an air strike of 60 Hellcat fighters, 65 Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet. They spotted it at 0735 and brushed aside the 13 Zeros that the Japanese had retained for self defense. Zuiho attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft, but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo carrying Avengers missed. The 500 pound 230 kg bomb started several small fires, lifted the rear elevator, bulged the flight deck, knocked out steering and gave the ship a small list to port. Twenty minutes later, the fires were put out, steering repaired and the list corrected. A second attack an hour later focused on Chiyoda and ignored Zuiho. The third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged the ship. She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs, although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room. Zuiho was forced to reduce speed to 12 knots 22 km h 14 mph and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 1410. The ship took on a 13 list to starboard and went dead in the water at 1445 when the port engine room fully flooded. A fourth wave of American aircraft attacked ten minutes later, but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses. This was enough to increase her list to 23 and she was ordered abandoned at 1510. Zuiho sank at 1526 at position 1920N 12515W 19.333N 125.250W 19.333 125.250Coordinates 1920N 12515W 19.333N 125.250W 19.333 125.250 with the loss of 7 officers and 208 men. The destroyer Kuwa and the battleship Ise rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuih%C5%8D-class%20aircraft%20carrier
"The Zuo zhuan Chinese WadeGiles Tso chuan , generally translated The Zuo Tradition or The Commentary of Zuo, is an ancient Chinese narrative history that is traditionally regarded as a commentary on the ancient Chinese chronicle Spring and Autumn Annals Chunqiu . It comprises 30 chapters covering a period from 722 to 468 BC, and focuses mainly on political, diplomatic, and military affairs from that era. The Zuo zhuan is famous for its relentlessly realistic style, and recounts many tense and dramatic episodes, such as battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents. For many centuries, the Zuo zhuan was the primary text through which educated Chinese gained an understanding of their ancient history. Unlike the other two surviving Annals commentariesthe Gongyang and Guliang commentariesthe Zuo zhuan does not simply explain the wording of the Annals, but greatly expounds upon its historical background, and contains a large number of rich and lively accounts of Spring and Autumn period 771476 BC history and culture. The Zuo zhuan is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work, and its concise, flowing style came to be held as a paragon of elegant Classical Chinese. Its tendency toward third person narration and portraying characters through direct speech and action became hallmarks of Chinese narrative in general, and its style was imitated by historians, storytellers, and ancient style prose masters for over 2000 years of subsequent Chinese history. Although the Zuo zhuan has long been regarded as a masterpiece of grand historical narrative , its early textual history is largely unknown, and the nature of its original composition and authorship have been widely debated. The Zuo of the title was traditionally believed to refer to one Zuo Qiuming an obscure figure of the 5th century BC described as a blind disciple of Confuciusbut there is little actual evidence to support this. Most scholars now generally believe that the Zuo zhuan was originally an independent work composed during the 4th century BC that was later rearranged as a commentary to the Annals. Notwithstanding its prominent position throughout Chinese history as the paragon of Classical Chinese prose, little is known of the Zuo zhuan's creation and early history. Bamboo and silk manuscripts excavated from late Warring States period c. 300 BC tombscombined with analyses of the Zuo zhuan's language, diction, chronological references, and philosophical viewpointssuggest that the composition of the Zuo zhuan was largely complete by 300 BC. However, no pre Han dynasty 206 BC AD 220 source indicates that the Zuo zhuan had to that point been organized into any coherent form, and no texts from this period directly refer to the Zuo zhuan as a source, though a few mention its parent text Spring and Autumn Annals Chunqiu . It seems to have had no distinct title of its own during this period, but was simply called Annals Chunqiu along with a larger group of similar texts. In the 3rd century AD, the Chinese scholar Du Yu intercalated it with the Annals so that each Annals entry was followed by the corresponding narrative from the Zuo zhuan, and this became the received format of the Zuo zhuan that exists today. Most scholars now generally believe that the Zuo zhuan was originally an independent work composed during the latter half of the 4th century BCthough probably incorporating some even older material that was later rearranged as a commentary to the Annals. China's first dynastic history Records of the Grand Historian, completed by the historian Sima Qian in the early 1st century BC, refers to the Zuo zhuan as Master Zuo's Spring and Autumn Annals Zuoshi Chunqiu and attributes it to a man named Zuo Qiuming or possibly Zuoqiu Ming . According to Sima Qian, after Confucius' death his disciples began disagreeing over their interpretations of the Annals, and so Zuo Qiuming gathered together Confucius' scribal records and used them to compile the Zuo Annals in order to preserve the true teachings. This Zuo Qiuming Sima Qian references was traditionally assumed to be the Zuo Qiuming who briefly appears in the Analects of Confucius Lunyu when Confucius praises him for his moral judgment. Other than this brief mention, nothing is concretely known of the life or identity of the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects, nor of what connection he might have with the Zuo zhuan. This traditional assumption that the title's Master Zuo refers to the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects is not based on any specific evidence, and was challenged by scholars as early as the 8th century. Even if he is the Zuo referenced in the Zuo zhuan's title, this attribution is questionable because the Zuo zhuan describes events from the late Spring and Autumn period c. 771476 BC that the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects could not have known. Alternatively, a number of scholars, beginning in the 18th century, have suggested that the Zuo zhuan was actually the product of one Wu Qi d. 381 or 378 BC , a military leader who served in the State of Wei and who, according to the Han Feizi, was from a place called Zuoshi . In 1792, the scholar Yao Nai wrote The text did not come from one person. There were repeated accretions and additions, with those of Wu Qi and his followers being especially numerous.... In the early 19th century, the Chinese scholar Liu Fenglu 17761829 initiated a long, drawn out controversy when he proposed, by emphasizing certain discrepancies between it and the Annals, that the Zuo zhuan was not originally a commentary on the Annals. Liu's theory was taken much further by the prominent scholar and reformer Kang Youwei, who argued that Liu Xin did not really find the ancient script version of the Zuo zhuan in the imperial archives, as historical records describe, but actually forged it as a commentary on the Annals. Kang's theory was that Liu Xinwho with his father Liu Xiang, the imperial librarian, was one of the first to have access to the rare documents in the Han dynasty's imperial archivestook the Discourses of the States Guoyu and forged it into a chronicle like work to fit the format of the Annals in an attempt to lend credibility to the policies of his master, the usurper Wang Mang. Kang's theory was supported by several subsequent Chinese scholars in the late 19th century, but was contradicted by a large number of 20th century studies that examined it from many different perspectives. In the early 1930s, the French Sinologist Henri Maspero performed a detailed textual study of the issue, concluding the Han dynasty forgery theory to be untenable. The Swedish Sinologist Bernhard Karlgren, based on a series of linguistic and philological analyses he carried out in the 1920s, concluded that the Zuo zhuan is a genuine ancient text probably to be dated between 468 and 300 BC. While Liu's hypothesis that the Zuo zhuan was not originally an Annals commentary has been generally accepted, Kang's theory of Liu Xin forging the Zuo zhuan is now considered discredited. The oldest surviving Zuo zhuan manuscripts are six fragments that were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century by the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot and are now held at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. Four of the fragments date to the Six Dynasties period 3rd to 6th centuries , while the other two date to the early Tang dynasty 7th century . The oldest known complete Zuo zhuan manuscript is the ancient manuscript scroll preserved at the Kanazawa Bunko Museum in Yokohama, Japan. The Zuo zhuan recounts the major political, military, and social events of the Spring and Autumn period from the perspective of the State of Lu, and is famous for its dramatic power and realistic details . It contains a variety of tense and dramatic episodes battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents. The Zuo zhuan originally contained only its core content, without any content from or references to the Spring and Autumn Annals. In the 3rd century AD, the Chinese scholar Du Yu intercalated the Annals into the Zuo zhuan, producing the received format that exists today. The entries follow the strict chronological format of the Annals, so interrelated episodes and the actions of individual characters are sometimes separated by events that occurred in the intervening years. Each Zuo zhuan chapter begins with the Spring and Autumn Annals Chunqiu entry for the year, which is usually terse and brief, followed by the Zuo zhuan content for that year, which often contains long and detailed narratives. The following entry, though unusually short, exemplifies the general format of all Zuo zhuan entries. Annals ,,,,,,, In the 31st year, in spring, a terrace was built in Lang. In summer, in the 4th month, the Liege of Xue died. A terrace was built at Xue. In the 6th month, the Prince of Qi came to present spoils from the Rong. In autumn, a terrace was built in Qin. In winter, it did not rain. Zuo ,,,,,,, In the 31st year, in summer, in the 6th month, the Prince of Qi came here to present spoils from the Rong this was not in accordance with ritual propriety. In all cases when the princes achieve some merit against the Yi of the four directions, they present these spoils to the king, and the king thereby issues a warning to the Yi. This was not done in the central domains. The princes do not present captives to one another. Chinese Zuo zhuan narratives are famously terse and succincta quality that was admired and imitated throughout Chinese historyand usually focus either on speeches that illustrate ethical values, or on anecdotes in which the details of the story illuminate specific ethical points. Its narratives are characterized by parataxis, where clauses are juxtaposed without much verbal indication of their causal relationships with each other. On the other hand, the speeches and recorded discourses of the Zuo zhuan are frequently lively, ornate, and verbally complex. Although the Zuo zhuan was probably not originally a commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals Chunqiu a work which was traditionally viewed as a direct creation of Confuciusits basic philosophical outlook is also strongly Confucian in nature. Its overarching theme is that haughty, evil, and stupid individuals generally bring disaster upon themselves, while those who are good, wise, and humble are usually justly rewarded. The Confucian principle of ritual propriety or ceremony li is seen as governing all actions, including war, and to bring bad consequences if transgressed. However, the observance of li is never shown as guaranteeing victory, and the Zuo zhuan includes many examples of the good and innocent suffering senseless violence. Much of the Zuo zhuan's status as a literary masterpiece stems from its relentlessly realistic portrayal of a turbulent era marked by violence, political strife, intrigues, and moral laxity . The narratives of the Zuo zhuan are highly didactic in nature, and are presented in such a way that they teach and illustrate moral principles. The German Sinologist Martin Kern has observed Instead of offering authorial judgments or catechistic hermeneutics, the Zuo zhuan lets its moral lessons unfold within the narrative itself, teaching at once history and historical judgment. Unlike the Histories of Herodotus or the History of the Peloponnesian War of Thucydideswith which it is roughly contemporarythe Zuo zhuan's narration always remains in the third person perspective, and presents as a dispassionate recorder of facts. Several of the Zuo zhuan's most famous sections are those dealing with critical historical battles, such as the Battle of Chengpu and the Battle of Bi. The Battle of Chengpu, the first of the Zuo zhuan's great battles, took place in the summer of 632 BC at Chengpu modern Juancheng County, Shandong Province in the State of Wey. On one side were the troops of the powerful State of Chu, from what was then far southern China, led by the Chu prime minister Cheng Dechen. They were opposed by the armies of the State of Jin, led by Chong'er, Duke of Jin, one of the most prominent and well known figures in the Zuo zhuan. Chu suffered a disastrous defeat in the battle itself, and it resulted in Chong'er being named Hegemon ba of the various states. ,,, On the day ji si the Jin army encamped at . The Jin commander Xu Chen, who was acting as assistant to the leader of the lower army, prepared to oppose the troops of Chen and Cai. ,,,,, On the Chu side, Dechen, with the 600 men of the Ruo'ao family, was acting as commander of the central army. Today, mark my word, Jin will be wiped out he said. Dou Yishen was acting as commander of the left wing of the Chu army, and Dou Bo as commander of the right wing. ,,, Xu Chen, having cloaked his horses in tiger skins, led the attack by striking directly at the troops of Chen and Cai. The men of Chen and Cai fled, and the right wing of the Chu army was thus routed. ,,,,,,,,,,,, Hu Mao hoisted two pennons and began to retreat, while Luan Zhi had his men drag brushwood over the ground to simulate the dust of a general rout. The Chu forces raced after in pursuit, whereupon Yuan Chen and Xi Chen, leading the duke's own select troops of the central army, fell upon them from either side. Hu Mao and Hu Yan, leading the upper army, turned about and likewise attacked Dou Yishen from either side, thereby routing the left wing of the Chu army. Thus the Chu army suffered a resounding defeat. Only Dechen, who had kept his troops back and had not attempted to pursue the enemy, as a result managed to escape defeat. The narrative of the Battle of Chengpu is typical of Zuo zhuan battle narratives the description of the battle itself is relatively brief, with most of the narrative being focused on battle preparations, omens and prognostications regarding its outcome, the division of the spoils, and the shifts and defections of the various allied states involved in the conflict. This official restrained style, which became typical of Chinese historical writing, is largely due to the ancient Chinese belief that ritual propriety and strategic preparation were more important than individual valor or bravery in determining the outcome of battles. Several of the most notable passages in the Zuo zhuan describe succession crises, which seem to have been fairly common in China during the Spring and Autumn period. These crises often involved the tangled affections of the various rulers, and are described in a dramatic and vivid manner that gives insight into the life of the aristocratic elite in the China of the mid 1st millennium BC. The best known of these stories is that of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, who ruled the State of Zheng from 743 to 701 BC. Duke Zhuang was born in a manner that startled his mother probably breech birth , which caused her to later seek to persuade her husband to name Duke Zhuang's younger brother as the heir apparent instead of him. The story ends with eventual reconciliation between mother and son, thus exemplifying the traditional Chinese virtues of both ritual propriety li and filial piety xiao , which has made it consistently popular with readers over the centuries. A number of Zuo zhuan anecdotes end with brief moral comments or verdicts that are attributed to either Confucius or an unnamed junzi gentleman , lordling , or superior man . ,, The gentleman remarks This alliance accorded with good faith. In this campaign, the ruler of Jin Chong'er was able to attack through the power of virtue. These moral of the story postfaces, which were added later by Confucian scholars, are directed toward those currently in power, reminding them of the historical precedents and inevitable consequences of their own actions. They speak with the voices of previous ministers, advisers, old men , and other anonymous figures to remind rulers of historical and moral lessons, and suggest that ruler who heed their advice will succeed, while those who do not will fail. Several sections of the Zuo zhuan demonstrate the traditional Chinese concept of fate or destiny ming , referring either to an individual's mission in life or their allotted lifespan, and illustrates how benevolent rulers ought to accept fate selflessly, as in the story of Duke Wen moving the capital of the state of Zhu in 614 BC. ,,,,,,,, Duke Wen of Zhu divined by turtle shell to determine if he should move his capital to the city of Yi. The historian who conducted the divination replied, The move will benefit the people but not their ruler. The ruler of Zhu said, If it benefits the people, it benefits me. Heaven gave birth to the people and set up a ruler in order to benefit them. If the people enjoy the benefit, I am bound to share in it. ,,,,,,,, Those around the ruler said, If by taking warning from the divination you can prolong your destiny, why not do so The ruler replied, My destiny lies in nourishing the people. Whether death comes to me early or late is merely a matter of time. If the people will benefit thereby, then nothing could be more auspicious than to move the capital. , In the end he moved the capital to Yi. In the fifth month Duke Wen of Zhu died. , The noble person remarks He understood the meaning of destiny. The Zuo zhuan has been recognized as a masterpiece of early Chinese prose and grand historical narrative for many centuries. It has had an immense influence on Chinese literature and historiography for nearly 2000 years, and was the primary text by which historical Chinese readers gained an understanding of China's ancient history. It enjoyed high status and esteem throughout the centuries of Chinese history because of its great literary quality, and was often read and memorized because of its role as the preeminent expansion and commentary on the Annals Chunqiu , which almost all Chinese traditionally ascribed to Confucius. It was commonly believed throughout much of Chinese history that the terse, succinct entries of the Annals contained cryptic references to Confucius' profound moral judgments on the events of the past as well as those of his own day and on the relation of human events to those in the natural order , and that the Zuo zhuan was written to clarify or even decode these hidden judgments. From the Han dynasty 206 BC AD 220 down to the present day, the Zuo zhuan has been viewed as a model of correct, elegant, and sophisticated Classical Chinese prose. The Zuo zhuan's great influence on the Chinese languageparticularly on Classical Chineseis evident from the fact that it is the source of more Chinese literary idioms chengyu than any other work, including the Analects of Confucius. The well known Qing dynasty student anthology Guwen Guanzhi included 34 passages from the Zuo zhuan as paragons of Classical Chinese prose more than any other source. These passages are still part of the Classical Chinese curriculum in mainland China and Taiwan today. The 400 year period the Zuo zhuan covers is now known as the Spring and Autumn period, after the Spring and Autumn Annals, but the Zuo zhuan is the most important source for the period. This era was highly significant in Chinese history, and saw a number of developments in governmental complexity and specialization that preceded China's imperial unification in 221 BC by the First Emperor of Qin. The latter years of this period also saw the appearance of Confucius, who later became the preeminent figure in Chinese cultural history. The Zuo zhuan is one of the only surviving written sources for the history of the Spring and Autumn period, and is extremely valuable as a rich source of information on the society that Confucius and his disciples lived in and from which the Confucian school of thought developed. It was canonized as one of the Chinese classics in the 1st century AD, and until modern times was one of the cornerstones of traditional education for men in China and the other lands of the Sinosphere such as Japan and Korea.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo%20zhuan
"Inon Zur Hebrew , born July 4, 1965 is an Israeli American music composer. Originally writing for movies and television, he later moved into composing for video games. He has been described as being internationally recognized as one of the A list orchestral composers in the video games industry . Zur has composed the music to over 50 video games, 15 television shows, and 10 films, as well as film trailers. He has been nominated for numerous awards, and has won threea Telly Award in 1997 for Best Score on Power Rangers Turbo, a Game Audio Network Guild award in 2004 for Best Original Instrumental track for Men of Valor, and a Hollywood Music in Media Award in 2009 for Best Original Song Video Game for Dragon Age Origins. Inon Zur was born in Israel. At the age of five, he was trying to compose harmonies with his mother's singing, and became inspired by classical music. He learned to play French horn as a child, studied piano by the age of eight, and was studying composition by the age of ten. He graduated from the Music Academy of Tel Aviv, and spent four years in the Israeli military. He emigrated to the United States in 1990 to study at the Dick Grove School of Music for a year, and then under private tutor Jack Smalley, a television music composer, and others for two years at the University of California, Los Angeles. Zur began his career in 1994 by working on soundtracks for movies, such as Yellow Lotus, featured at the Sundance Film Festival. He signed on to compose for Fox Family for six years, and made soundtracks for various children's television shows, including Digimon and Power Rangers. By 2002, he estimated that he had composed the soundtrack to over 360 Power Rangers episodes. He won his first award during this period in his career, a Telly Award for his work on Power Rangers Turbo. While he enjoyed the work, he began to want to go work somewhere more intriguing, more advanced, and basically a place that people really appreciate music more his agent overcame his initial reluctance and convinced him to work in the video games industry. His first video game soundtrack was 2000's Star Trek Klingon Academy, which he started composing for the game in 1997. Zur moved on to prestigious titles, composing for the award winning and critically acclaimed Baldur's Gate II Throne of Bhaal in 2001 and Icewind Dale II in 2002, among many others. Icewind Dale II earned him the first of many nominations for video game music awards, that of the Game Audio Network Guild's Music of the Year award. He continued to work on movies and television programs during these years, composing the soundtrack to Au Pair in 1999 and the English version of the 2000 anime series Escaflowne. Zur's latest movie soundtrack to date was that of 2001's Au Pair II. He has worked on a few television series since then his last traditional television soundtrack was for The Bachelor in 2002, though he has composed music for three webisode series since then. He continued to work on numerous video games, including Prince of Persia The Two Thrones in 2005 and Crysis in 2007. He has garnered several nominations for video game music awards, including his first win, for Men of Valor in the Best Original Instrumental track category of the 2004 Game Audio Network Guild awards. His latest released titles have been Fallout 3 and Prince of Persia in 2008, and 2009's Dragon Age Origins and the Nintendo DS version of James Cameron's Avatar The Game, and 2015's Fallout 4. Dragon Age has earned Zur his third career award, that of Best Original Song Video Game in the 2009 Hollywood Music In Media Awards. Zur penned the original musical score for The Lord of the Rings War in the North video game, conducting and recording with the London Philharmonia Orchestra and the Pinewood Singers Choir at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London. In an industry first, a dedicated concert of his music from War in the North was performed each evening at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 in Los Angeles. The one hour concert series was conducted by Zur and performed by The Hollywood Orchestra and Choir with the participation of The Lyris Quartet and solos from celebrated vocalist Aubrey Ashburn. Zur's compositions have been played several times in live concerts. The first of these was a concert held in Seoul, South Korea on May 30, 2006 dedicated to his music for Lineage II Chronicle V Oath of Blood. On August 20, 2008, music from his soundtrack to Crysis was played in Leipzig, Germany at a Video Games Live concert. His music from Dragon Age Origins and Prince of Persia was performed at the September 26, 2009 A Night in Fantasia 2009 concert in Sydney, Australia by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra. Inon Zur was a special guest at the concert. Zur's compositions frequently are focused on full orchestras, choir and, in some games like Prince of Persia, ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind duduk. He has often collaborated with the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though he has on occasion used other orchestras. Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself. He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as Sergey Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Beethoven, movie composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith, and jazz artists like George Gershwin and Henry McFeeny. While he would one day like to compose music not intended to be part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process. He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own . Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks for example, he worked with Florence and the Machine to create a unique rendition of Im Not Calling You A Liar for the Dragon Age II soundtrack. Zur typically is brought in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and televisionwhere nothing changes after he starts besides post production effectsmaking video game music composition a more flexible process. He finds that it is crucial for him to play a game before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music intuitively , rather than spending a lot of time planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects that he would like to work on in the future that he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inon%20Zur
"Alexander Sascha Zverev born 20 April 1997 is a German professional tennis player. He is the second youngest player ranked in the top 10 by the Association of Tennis Professionals ATP , and was a permanent fixture in the top 5 throughout 2018. He has won 11 ATP titles in singles and two in doubles. Zverev is the reigning champion at the ATP Finals, making him the youngest winner at the year end championship in a decade. Zverev is the only active player outside of the Big Four with three Masters titles. He has been praised by members of the Big Four as one of their potential successors. Rafael Nadal has called him a clear possible future No. 1. Novak Djokovic has said, Hopefully, he can surpass me. Zverev was born into a tennis family. His parents Irina and Alexander Sr. both played professionally for the Soviet Union, and his older brother Mischa is also a professional who has been ranked as high as No. 25 in the world. Zverev is a former world No. 1 junior, and won a junior Grand Slam singles title at the 2014 Australian Open. He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and also upset then world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he was the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Djokovic. Alexander Sascha Zverev was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany, to Irina Zvereva and Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev. He has an older brother Mischa who was born nearly a decade earlier and is a professional tennis player as well. Both of Sascha's parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father was ranked as high as No. 175 in the world. He was also the top ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Sascha's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the country. Sascha began playing tennis at a very young age. He has said, One day, when I was I think one year and five months old, I just picked up a little racket, and I was starting to push the ball all over our apartment, and since then they took me out on the court. I enjoy it still, I enjoyed it back then. When he was five years old, he started to play tennis at least half an hour each day. Sascha was extremely competitive as a child. His brother Mischa said, He would not understand or accept that he was losing when the two would play against each other. He would never want to leave the court unless he won the match. Sascha also played hockey and football as a child, but decided to focus only on tennis around the age of 12 after an early round loss at a high level international junior tournament in Florida. When Sascha was young, his mother was his primary coach while his father was focused on coaching his brother. He has said, I think I have pretty good technique, which my mum did at a young age, so credit to her for that. My backhand, in particular, is 100 per cent down to my mum. While his mother had a more relaxed teaching style, his father had a very Soviet way of doing physical training sessions that involved doing timed drills for fixed numbers of repetitions. Sascha's coaches aimed for him to have a riskier, aggressive playing style built around hitting the ball with pace and finishing points quickly. This was a big contrast from how he played around age 12 when his style centered around being an unbelievable fighter from the baseline in part because he was too slow to go to the net. Initially, Sascha struggled to change his playing style. He made a lot of errors and lost to opponents who excelled at keeping points alive. However, his father stuck with this strategy, saying, We must practice fast tennis, aggressive tennis. If you lose today its no big deal. You must think about the future. Zverev is a former world No. 1 junior. He entered his first event on the International Tennis Federation ITF junior circuit in early 2011 when he was 13. Near the beginning of 2012, Zverev won his first ITF title at the Fujairah Junior Championships, a low level Grade 4 tournament in the United Arab Emirates. He would pick up a lower level Grade 5 title at the Oman International Junior 2 a few weeks later, which led him to begin competing in higher level events shortly before his 15th birthday. He did not have much success at tournaments that were Grade 2 and above until the following year when he reached back to back doubles finals with Spencer Papa at the Grade A Copa Gerdau and the Grade 1 USTA International Spring Championships. Zverev's early season success in doubles proved to be the precursor of a major improvement in singles as well. During the European clay court season, he won his first Grade 1 title over Andrey Rublev at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu sur Mer. He followed up that performance with his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio a month later, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history. He also finished runner up at the 2013 French Open to Christian Garin. Zverev had some grass court success as well, finishing runner up to Nick Kyrgios at the Junior International Roehampton. However, he needed to retire at Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury. Zverev came close to reaching another Grand Slam boys' singles final at the 2013 Junior US Open, but was defeated by the eventual champion Borna Coric in the semifinals. This success was enough for him to take over the No. 1 ranking in late October. Before the end of the season, Zverev also represented Germany in the Junior Fed Cup, leading them to a fourth place finish. His last tournament of the year was the Grade A Orange Bowl, where he was defeated by Stefan Kozlov in the semifinals. As the top ranked junior at the end of the season, he was named the ITF Junior World Champion, becoming the youngest boys' champion since Donald Young in 2005. Zverev played just two tournaments in 2014, both in Australia in January. He won the singles events at both tournaments, the first of which came against Australian Omar Jasika at the Traralgon Junior International. At the Australian Open, he was able to defeat Kozlov, who was seeded second, to finish his junior career with a first Grand Slam title. As the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the 2011 Moselle Open on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches. He won his professional main draw debut against compatriot Christian Lichtenegger at a Futures event in Germany in August 2012. Towards the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner up to Florian Reynet at an ITF 10K event in Florida. Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro level final that year. However, he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut at his hometown tournament, the International German Open. He also made his ATP Challenger Tour debut, losing to Maximo Gonzalez at the Meerbusch Challenger in August. After wining the boys' singles title at the 2014 Australian Open, Zverev shifted his focus to his professional career, only playing in pro events the rest of the year. Initially, he struggled on the pro tour, failing to qualify for the main draw at his first five events of the season. He did not win a main draw match until he recorded a single victory at the Heilbronner Neckarcup Challenger, his tenth event of the year. One of his losses was a retirement against his brother Mischa. Zverev made his first professional breakthrough in July when he won the Braunschweig Challenger for his first professional title, despite entering the tournament with just one career Challenger level match win and no top 100 victories. Three of the players he defeated were in the top 100, including his first round opponent No. 87 Tobias Kamke, his semifinal opponent No. 56 Andrey Golubev, and his final opponent No. 89 Paul Henri Mathieu. At the age of 17 years and 2 months, he became the youngest player to win a Challenger title since Bernard Tomic in 2009 and the twelfth youngest in history. Zverev followed up this title with a breakthrough at the ATP Tour level. He entered the International German Open having never won an ATP match, but managed to reached the semifinals. He recorded four match wins at the event, including his first career victory against Robin Haase and his first top 20 victory over No. 16 Mikhail Youzhny before losing to No. 7 David Ferrer. He became the first 17 year old to defeat a top 20 opponent since Richard Gasquet in 2004 and the first to make a semifinal since Marin Cilic in 2006. Zverev had risen from No. 665 to No. 285 after his Challenger title, and his ATP 500 Series semifinal appearance took him to No. 161 in the world. He finished the season ranked No. 136. At the beginning of the season, Zverev was still ranked too low to receive direct entry into the main draws of ATP Tour events, which forced him to continue playing Challenger events through July. He also needed to enter qualifying for ATP events throughout the year. Zverev did not qualify for either of the first two Grand Slam singles events of the season. He was able to qualify for his first Masters event at the Miami Open and reached the second round. During the clay court season, Zverev partnered with his brother Mischa to reach his first career ATP final in doubles at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships. The Zverev brothers finished runner up to top seeded Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares. Later that month, he won his second career Challenger title at the Heilbronn Neckarcup to crack the top 100 of the ATP rankings. With a higher ranking, Zverev was directly accepted into Wimbledon. A week before the tournament, he took part in the Boodles Challenge exhibition and surprisingly upset world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets. Zverev backed up this performance in his Grand Slam main draw debut, defeating Teymuraz Gabashvili in a tight match that lasted until 97 in the fifth and final set. He lost in the next round to Denis Kudla. Zverev opted to play on clay after Wimbledon and reached another ATP semifinal at the Swedish Open to put him back in the top 100 after one week out. In August, Zverev returned to the United States and competed in two US Open Series events. He notably upset No. 14 Kevin Anderson at the Citi Open en route to the quarterfinals. Zverev's brief rankings drop in July meant that he needed to qualify for the 2015 US Open. He succeeded, but lost his opening round match to compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber in five sets. Zverev won just one more main draw match the rest of the season and ended the year ranked No. 83 in the world. As the youngest player in the top 100, he was named the ATP Newcomer of the Year. Zverev's first ATP event of the year was the Australian Open, where he had a difficult draw against world No. 2 Andy Murray and was only able to win six games in his opening match. He bounced back at the Open Sud de France, reaching the semifinals in the singles event and his second career final with his brother in the doubles event. During the singles event, he upset No. 13 Marin Cilic, the highest ranked player he had defeated in an official match at the time. Zverev then produced a strong result at the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated two top 30 players. In the fourth round, he nearly upset No. 5 Rafael Nadal. Zverev had a match point while he was serving for the final set, but missed a routine forehand volley and then proceeded to lose 14 of the remaining 15 points in the match. He commented on the match point that, I missed probably the easiest shot I had the whole match. Back in Europe, Zverev was able to recover as he reached his first ATP singles final at the Open de Nice Cote d'Azur, finishing runner up to No. 15 Dominic Thiem, the top seed and the defending champion. Thiem would also defeat him in the third round of the French Open. Zverev on his victory against Federer at the Halle Open. Zverev's next breakthrough came during the grass court season at the Halle Open, where he upset world No. 3 Roger Federer in the semifinals, ending Federer's streak of ten consecutive appearances in the final while competing at the tournament. He was also the first teenager to defeat Federer since Murray nearly a decade earlier. Nonetheless, he finished runner up at the event to veteran compatriot Florian Mayer. After this final, he entered the top 30 for the first time and stayed ranked in the 20s for the rest of the season. Despite being seeded at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time, Zverev could then only match his best Grand Slam singles result at Wimbledon, again falling to Berdych. During the US Open Series, he reached the semifinals of the Washington Open, but lost his opening round matches at both Masters events. He was then upset in the second round of the US Open by Dan Evans. After the US Open, Zverev returned to Europe and won his first career ATP title at the St. Petersburg Open. He recorded his first win over No. 9 Berdych in the semifinals and defeated No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in the final, coming back from 03 down in the third set. At his next event, he then defeated No. 10 Thiem in the first round of the 2016 China Open for the first time in four tries this year. In doing so, he became the first teenager to record three consecutive victories against top ten opponents since Boris Becker in 1986. Zverev's third round appearance at the Shanghai Masters then helped him rise to No. 20 in the ATP rankings, making him the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006. During the 2017 season, Zverev greatly improved his results at the higher level tournaments on the ATP Tour except for the Grand Slam events. At the Australian Open, Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets. His next ATP tournament was the Open Sud de France, where he won both the singles and doubles events. He and his brother defeated Fabrice Martin and Daniel Nestor for Alexander's first doubles title. The following month, he made his first Masters quarterfinal at the Miami Open, upsetting No. 3 Stan Wawrinka along the way. Nick Kyrgios defeated him at both Masters events that month. After a slow start to the clay court season, Zverev won two more titles in May, the first of which came at home in Germany at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships. He then followed up a second Masters quarterfinal at the Madrid Open with his first Masters title at the Rome Masters. He defeated Novak Djokovic in the final to become the youngest Masters champion since Djokovic in 2007 and the first such champion born in the 1990s. With the title, he also entered the top 10 for the first time. Despite his triumph in Rome, he lost his opening round match at the French Open. During the grass court season, Zverev made another singles final and again faced Federer at the Halle Open, but could not defeat him this time. He and his brother also finished runner up in the doubles event to ukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo. At Wimbledon, he achieved his best result at a Grand Slam event to date, ultimately losing to the previous year's runner up Milos Raonic in a tight five set match. Back on hard courts, Zverev won his last two titles of the season in August. He won the Washington Open as well as a second consecutive Masters title at the Canadian Open, only dropping a single set at each tournament in each of his opening matches. Notably, he needed to save three match points in his first match in Canada against Richard Gasquet, including a 49 shot rally. He then defeated Roger Federer in the final to become the first player outside of the Big Four to win multiple Masters titles in the same season since David Nalbandian in 2007. Despite this success, he was upset in the second round of the US Open by fellow Next Gen player Borna Coric. At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the inaugural Next Generation Finals as one of the top seven 21 and under players, and the ATP Finals as one of the top eight players in the world. He opted to skip the former event to focus on the latter. At the ATP Finals, Zverev was grouped with Roger Federer, Marin Cilic, and Jack Sock. He defeated Cilic in his first match, but lost his final two matches and did not advance out of his round robin group. Zverev finished the year ranked No. 4, peaking at No. 3 right before the ATP Finals, and accumulated five ATP titles from just six finals. Zverev maintained his top 5 ranking throughout the year. However, he still did not deliver any high caliber results at the Grand Slam tournaments. He was upset at the Australian Open by reigning Next Gen Finals champion and No. 59 Chung Hyeon in five sets in the third round. Zverev stated that issues at majors were definitely not physical when asked if his problems were physical or mental, and also attribute this lack of success to the extra pressure he was putting on himself at these events. Zverev did not reach his first final of the year until early April at the Miami Masters. Despite taking the first set of the final, he finished runner up to American John Isner, who had never previously won a Masters title. Zverev continued his Masters success into the clay court season, reaching the semifinals at the Monte Carlo Masters, winning his third career Masters title at the Madrid Open, and making the final at the Rome Masters. In Madrid, he defeated Dominic Thiem in the final to become the only active player outside of the Big Four to have won three Masters titles. He came close to winning back to back Masters events, going up a break in the third set against Nadal at the Italian Open. However, Nadal was able to recover and win the final five games of the match after a rain delay. Zverev had also defended his title at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships in his only other French Open tune up to help build up a 13 match win streak that lasted until the Italian Open final. He capped off his excellent clay court season by reaching his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open. He needed to win three five set matches to get that far before Thiem ended his run while he was faced with a hamstring injury. Up until the year end championships, Zverev struggled to build on his early season success. He lost in the third round at both Wimbledon and the US Open, and his best result at the four remaining Masters events was a semifinal at the Shanghai Masters. He was able to defend his title at the Washington Open, his only title during this period. Zverev also reached two more doubles finals with his brother, but did not win either of them. At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the Next Generation Finals and the ATP Finals for the second consecutive year, again choosing to only compete at the latter event. He was placed in a group with Novak Djokovic, Marin Cilic, and John Isner. This year, Zverev was able to advance out of the group, only losing to No. 1 Djokovic in the round robin. He faced Federer in the semifinals and defeated him in straight sets to set up a rematch with Djokovic. Despite being a heavy underdog and having just lost to Djokovic earlier in the week, Zverev won the final in straight sets for the tenth and biggest title of his career. He became the youngest tour champion since Djokovic a decade earlier and the first German to win the season ending championships since Boris Becker in 1995. This was also Zverev's first victory over a current world No. 1 player. Zverev opened his 2019 season with a fourth round appearance at the Australian Open, defeating Jeremy Chardy in five sets in the second round before losing to Milos Raonic in straight sets. Zverev next played at the Mexican Open and finished runner up to Nick Kyrgios. Following this tournament, he did not win more than one match at any of his next five events. He broke his slump by advancing to the quarterfinals of the 2019 Mutua Madrid Open, by beating David Ferrer and Hubert Hurkacz. In the quarterfinals, Zverev lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas. In Rome Zverev lost to Matteo Berrettini in second round. Zverev won his first 2019 title in Geneva, defeating Nicolas Jarry in the final after saving two match points. He went on to defeat Fabio Fognini and reach his second consecutive quarterfinal at the French Open, where he was stopped by Novak Djokovic in straight sets. As the top seed at the Stuttgart Open, Zverev was upset in three sets by Dustin Brown in the first round. He was seeded second at the Halle Open, reaching the quarterfinals when he lost to David Goffin. At Wimbledon, he was upset in the first round by Jiri Vesely this was Zverev's first first round loss at a major tournament since 2017. At the German Open, he reached the semifinals, losing to defending champion Nikoloz Basilashvili. Zverev was the defending champion in Washington, but chose not to defend his title. At the Rogers Cup, he was defeated by sixth seed Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals. He was then upset by Miomir Kecmanovic in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters. Seeded sixth at the US Open, Zverev defeated Radu Albot, Frances Tiafoe, and Aljaz Bedene to reach the fourth round at the tournament for the first time. There, he lost to 20th seeded Diego Schwartzman in four sets. At the China Open he beat Francis Tiafoe, Felix Auger Aliassime, and Sam Querrey in straight sets before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas in two close sets. At Shanghai Masters, Zverev had the best Masters 1000 tournament of the season, defeating Roger Federer in the quarterfinals and Matteo Berrettini in the semis, but lost the final to an in form Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. Zverev began his season representing Germany at the Hopman Cup with Sabine Lisicki. The duo won their tie against the French team, with Zverev winning both his singles and mixed doubles matches. However, they were shut out against Great Britain and Australia Green and did not advance to the final. Zverev also represented Germany against the Czech Republic at the Davis Cup the following month. He faced No. 7 Tomas Berdych in his debut match and took a two sets to one lead before ultimately losing in five sets. After the Czech Republic won the doubles rubber while Kohlschreiber won both singles matches, Zverev faced Lukas Rosol in a decisive fifth rubber. Rosol won the match easily to send the Czech Republic into the next round. Zverev again began the year at the Hopman Cup, this time playing alongside Andrea Petkovic. While the pair only won their tie against Great Britain, Zverev also defeated Federer in singles in his first tournament back from injury. In the Davis Cup against Belgium, he recorded his first career match win in the competition against Arthur De Greef, but lost the doubles rubber with his brother as well as his second singles match to Steve Darcis. Belgium won the tie 41. Late in the season, Zverev took part in the inaugural Laver Cup. He accrued four points by winning both of his singles matches for Team Europe as they defeated Team World 159. Zverev started the season at the Hopman Cup for the third consecutive year, this time competing alongside Angelique Kerber, his third different partner at the event. For the first time, he was able to advance to the final, primarily on the strength of the pair winning all three of their mixed doubles matches. In the final against Switzerland, Zverev lost his singles match to Federer. Although Kerber won her singles match against Belinda Bencic, they lost the decisive mixed doubles rubber. Later in the year, Zverev won his first Davis Cup tie, winning both of his singles matches against Alex de Minaur and Kyrgios to lead Germany to a 31 victory over Australia. In the quarterfinals, Germany took a 21 lead against Spain behind Zverev's win over David Ferrer and a victory in doubles. However, Spain ultimately won the tie on the final day after Zverev was unable to defeat Nadal and Kohlschreiber lost a tight five set match to Ferrer. Zverev also participated in the Laver Cup and won the clinching match for Team Europe against Kevin Anderson. Zverev and Kerber returned to the Hopman Cup and again reached the final to set up a rematch of the previous year's final with Federer and Bencic. In a round robin group with Australia, France, and Spain, the two of them won all six of their singles matches, but lost two of their three mixed doubles matches against Australia and France. Like the previous year, the final was decided by the mixed doubles match after Federer defeated Zverev and Kerber defeated Bencic. With the Fast4 format, the match went to three sets. In the third set tiebreak, both teams had a match point at 44. Switzerland won the point with Federer serving to win the title. Zverev again won the decisive match at the Laver Cup. Zverev is an aggressive baseliner. He often stands far back behind the baseline and aims to hit powerful groundstrokes either for winners or to wear down his opponent. Although his height slows him down on the court, it also adds to his reach and gives him the ability to get more balls back in play. Novak Djokovic has commented that he moves well for his height. Zverev can generate a lot of power with both his backhand and forehand. His backhand in particular is regarded as his strength and one of the best in the game. Zverev uses a semi open stance and employs a western grip when hitting forehands. He has a continental eastern grip on his backhand. He can also hit slice backhands that require a low center of gravity, in spite of his height. With Zverev's height of 1.98 metres 6 ft 6 in , he can generate big serves at 220 kilometres per hour 140 mph or faster at sharper angles than shorter players. The year Zverev first broke into the top 20, he was still not one of the better servers on tour, ranking just 38th in serve rating, a statistic that combines six basic serving statistics 1st serve percentage, 1st serve percentage points won, 2nd serve percentage points won, service games won percentage, aces, and double faults. This was well behind him ranking 18th in return rating, showing that his return game was much stronger than his serving. By 2018, he had improved in both categories, ranking 19th in serve rating and 8th in return rating. Zverev excels in particular at hitting a high percentage of first serves in, landing 64.2 in 2018. In his return game, he had the fifth highest percentage of first serve points won that year at 32.4 . Zverev is an all court player and does not aim to be better on any surface in particular. He has said, I feel like I can play on all surfaces. Ive been to two finals or won tournaments on every single surface. I dont feel like I have to focus on one... I feel like I have good chances at all of them. Toni Nadal, the uncle and coach of Rafael Nadal, has praised his ability on hard courts in particular, saying, His best surface is, in my eyes, the hard court, because he moves better than he does on clay. Six of Zverev's first ten titles came on hard courts, while the other four were on clay. As of the end of 2018, he has yet to win a title on grass, but has reached two finals and also defeated Federer on that surface. Zverev has the ability to serve and volley as well. His older brother Mischa is regarded as the biggest proponent of this playing style on the modern tour. Although Sascha does not employ this technique as often as his brother, he has shown it can be effective in big matches such as the Madrid Masters final against Dominic Thiem, a player who rarely comes to the net. Zverev's volleying technique is regarded as one of his biggest weaknesses. Zverev was tall, but skinny and not very muscular when growing up. His fitness trainer Jez Green has focused on making him stronger and set a goal for him to add 4 kilograms 8.8 lb of muscle each year. Initially, Zverev had difficulty adjusting to this training style on the court, saying, I had no idea what was going on in my body, and needed to adapt his shot technique as he became more muscular. Eventually, he showed improvement on the court. Green remarked, He started to become less wobbly. He started to absorb power, so when someone hit hard he could hit the ball back and everything locked into place. Zverev has been coached by his parents since he was very young. His mother was initially his primary coach before his father took over at some point. Zverev made the decision to hire former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Washington Open in the summer of 2017. He fired Ferrero following the Australian Open after Ferrero criticized the rest of Zverev's coaching team. Ivan Lendl, another former world No. 1, joined Zverev's team in August 2018. They split up in July 2019 due to disappointing results and personal differences. Zverev has stated that Lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching. The rest of Zverev's coaching team includes fitness trainer Jez Green, who previously worked with Andy Murray, and physio Hugo Gravil. Green has worked with Zverev since 2013. Zverev lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco. When he was growing up, he lived in Hamburg. He also has spent his winters living in Florida at the Saddlebrook academy since he was 12 years old. As a result of his parents' background and living in different countries, he can speak German, Russian, and English. With his older brother competing on the ITF Junior Circuit and later on the ATP Tour, Zverev had frequent opportunities to meet or train with professional tennis players as a child. He took a photograph with Roger Federer at the Hamburg Masters when he was five years old. Zverev recalled the encounter, saying, So I got his autograph and he said, 'Well, maybe if you work hard, one day we might play against each other somewhere.' He had also met Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic when he was four years old. He has said, They actually tell me the first time they met me, because I cant remember. They say, 'Oh, I remember that junior tournament in Italy. We played, like, mini tennis with you.' His father remembers many instances where Sascha practiced with ATP professionals, giving one example as, We went to Dusseldorf for World Team Cup. Mischa was in a team, and I remember Gilles Simon was waiting for other players to join him. I say, 'Gilles, can you play with Sascha for 20 minutes ' It was normal. Zverev's tennis idol is Roger Federer. He has said Federer is the only player that has made him feel starstruck. When Zverev defeated Federer to win his second career Masters title at the 2017 Canadian Open, he said, This one against Roger is something so special for me because he was always a great idol growing up for me. The greatest player of all time, beating him in a final, not just any final but in the final of a Masters 1000, is amazing. Zverev plays other sports in his spare time such as basketball and golf. He is a fan of the Miami Heat in the National Basketball Association NBA . Zverev's best friend on the tour is Brazilian doubles specialist Marcelo Melo, a former French Open and Wimbledon champion. Melo frequently appears in Zverev's box during matches, including at the 2017 Washington Open and the 2018 ATP Finals, both of which he won. Current through the 2019 Swiss Indoors.

"The ZX81 is a home computer that was produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States where it was initially sold as the ZX 81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorized clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries. The ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all inexpensive, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes. It had only four silicon chips and a mere 1 KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts, with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present on early ZX81 USA models and the Timex Sinclair 1000, and it used a pressure sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought designer Rick Dickinson a Design Council award. The ZX81 could be bought by mail order in kit form or pre assembled. It was the first inexpensive mass market home computer that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the point when computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of businessmen and electronics hobbyists. It produced a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81, and many went on to play a major role in the British computer industry. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder Sir Clive Sinclair. The ZX81 has a base configuration of 1 KB of on board memory that can officially be expanded externally to 16 KB. Its single circuit board is housed inside a wedge shaped plastic case measuring 167 millimetres 6.6 in deep by 40 millimetres 1.6 in high. The memory is provided by either a single 4118 1024 bit 8 or two 2114 1024 bit 4 RAM chips. There are only three other onboard chips a 3.5 MHz Z80A 8 bit microprocessor from NEC, an uncommitted logic array ULA chip from Ferranti, and an 8 KB ROM providing a simple BASIC interpreter. The entire machine weighs just 350 grams 12 oz . Early versions of the external RAM cartridge contain 15 KB of memory using an assortment of memory chips, while later versions contain 16 KB chips, but the lowest addressed kilobyte is disabled. The front part of the case is occupied by an integrated 40 key membrane keyboard displaying 20 graphic and 54 inverse video characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context. For example, the P key combines the letter P, the character, and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB. The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40 pressure pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns. The ZX81's primary input output is delivered via four sockets on the left side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 22 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5 mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR output and MIC input sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This stores each data bit as a number of pulses, with each pulse being a 150 s 'high' then a 150 s 'low', followed by an inter bit silence of 1300 s. A '0' bit consists of four pulses and a '1' bit of nine pulses. The baud rate therefore varies between 400 bps for all '0's and 250 bps for all '1's. A file with equal amounts of '0's and '1's would be stored at 307 bps 38 bytes sec . This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 711 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply. The ULA chip, described by the ZX81 manual as the dogsbody of the system, has a number of key functions that competing computers share between multiple chips and integrated circuits. These comprise the following The ZX81's built in RF modulator can output a video picture to either a UHF 625 line colour or monochrome television used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries . France required a slightly modified version of the machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the US and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525 line VHF NTSC television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback in the way that they handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation such as processing a keystroke takes place. The ZX81's designers adopted an improved approach, involving the use of two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively. In SLOW mode, also called compute and display mode, the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display. It runs the current program for only about a quarter of the time in effect slowing the machine down fourfold, although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done. In FAST mode, processing occurs continuously, but the display is abandoned to its own devices equivalent to the ZX80's standard operating mode. Another hardware quirk produced one of the most distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes. The unexpanded ZX81's tiny memory presents a major challenge to programmers. Simply displaying a full screen takes up to 793 bytes, the system variables take up another 125 bytes, and the program, input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that. Nonetheless, ingenious programmers are able to achieve a surprising amount with just 1 KB. One example is 1K ZX Chess by David Horne, which includes most of the rules of chess in 672 bytes. The ZX81 conserves its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one byte tokens, stored as individual characters in the upper reaches of the machine's unique non ASCII character set. The edge connector or external interface at the rear of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board. This provides a set of address, control, and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices. Enthusiasts and a variety of third party companies make use of this facility to create a wide range of add ons for the ZX81. The following table provides a comparison between the capabilities of the ZX81 and various other competing microcomputers that were already on the market at the time of the ZX81's launch. The prices given are as of December 1982. Clive Sinclair's first company Sinclair Radionics, established in 1962, made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market. Its products include amplifiers, radios, multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists. The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first slimline pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. It was a major success that Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators. The company's subsequent expansion made it Europe's biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975. By the late 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was experiencing serious difficulties. It lost its ability to compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a new generation of Japanese produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than 350,000 in 197576, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board NEB , which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73 stake. Clive Sinclair's relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go. Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business, which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable. Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view that there was no future in consumer electronics . This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July 1979. While he was struggling with the NEB, Clive Sinclair turned to a corporate lifeboat in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control a company called Ablesdeal Ltd, which he had established in 1973 and later renamed Science of Cambridge. It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects, free of the interference of the NEB. Despite his later success in the field, Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end. As he told the Sunday Times in April 1985, We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business , specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV80 pocket television and C5 electric vehicle. In an interview with Practical Computing, Sinclair explained I make computers because they are a good market, and they are interesting to design. I don't feel bad about making them or selling them for money or anything, there is a demand for them and they do no harm but I don't think they are going to save the world. By the late 1970s, American companies were producing simple home computer kits such as the MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced the appeal of the American products. New Scientist stated in 1977 that the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain . Off the shelf personal computers were also available for the high end of the market but were extremely expensive Olivetti's offering cost 2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for 700. There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market. Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity. Sinclair's first home computer was the MK14, which was launched in kit form in June 1978. It was a long way from being a mass market product. Its very name MK standing for Microcomputer Kit was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists. It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display though Science of Cambridge did produce an add on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board it had no built in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory and input was via a 20 key hexadecimal keyboard. Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 1015,000 units by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low cost computers that could profitably be exploited. Sinclair followed up the MK14 by producing the ZX80, at the time the world's smallest and cheapest computer, which was launched in January 1980 costing 99.95 equivalent to 319 at 2009 prices. The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80 according to Clive Sinclair, he simply had a hunch that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume. The ZX80's design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX81 as Sinclair himself later said, the ZX80 was very much a stepping stone to the ZX81 . The design was driven entirely by the desired price the machine had to cost less than 100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine. The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and feel . Inside the case, there were many more similarities with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1 KB of on board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main difference between the two machines lay in the internal software when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board. The ZX80 was an immediate success, selling 20,000 units over the following nine months. Science of Cambridge was producing ZX80s at the rate of 9,000 a month by the end of 1980 and within 18 months of its launch the company had sold 100,000 units. The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow up product inevitable. The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980, reflecting its new focus, and became Sinclair Research in March 1981. The launch of the ZX81 was catalysed in part by the British Broadcasting Corporation's plan to produce a TV series, to be broadcast in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Clive Sinclair got wind of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 an indication of how the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations . A prototype ZX81 was demonstrated to BBC representatives in January 1981, while Sinclair's local rival Acorn Computers put forward their proposed Proton computer, a design of which a prototype did not yet exist based on the Acorn Atom. To Sinclair's dismay, the contract to produce the BBC Microcomputer went to Acorn, which launched the machine in January 1982. Paul Kriwaczek, the producer of The Computer Programme, explained his reservations in a March 1982 interview with Your Computer I would have been very reluctant for the BBC to sell something like the Sinclair because it is so limited. The Sinclair cannot be expanded it is fundamentally a throw away consumer product. Its usefulness lies in learning about programming, but I do not believe that the future of computers lies in everyone learning to program in BASIC. Sinclair was critical of the BBC's decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, that schools could purchase, with the aid of a grant, for half price Sinclair's computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 KB RAM pack for 60, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of 90. As the cheapest Government approved system was 130, this was an attractive offer for many schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair's package. The development of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched. Sinclair's chief engineer, Jim Westwood, was given the task of improving the ZX80's hardware to reduce the number of components and thus bring down the cost. He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80. Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80's chips into a single uncommitted logic array ULA , a type of general purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture. This short lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised logic chip, which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost. Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair, who hailed Westwood's design as a triumph of innovation The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect, the TRS 80, had 44. Only 70 of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used, but Sinclair decided to use them all to squeeze more functions in. This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage. Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case. The ZX81's ROM was doubled to 8 KB, from the ZX80's 4 KB ROM. This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC termed Sinclair BASIC by the company . Clive Sinclair re commissioned a company called Nine Tiles, which had produced the ZX80 ROM, to develop the new ROM software for the ZX81. The code was written by John Grant, the owner of Nine Tiles, and Steve Vickers, who had joined the company in January 1980. Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX81's hardware, while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual. Sinclair's brief to the pair was fairly non specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX80 so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations. Vickers later recalled As far as Clive was concerned, it wasn't a question of what the machine ought to be able to do, but more what could be crammed into the machine given the component budget he'd set his mind on. The only firm brief for the '81 was that the '80's math package must be improved. The new ROM incorporated trigonometric and floating point functions, which its predecessor had lacked the ZX80 could only deal with whole numbers. Grant came up with one of the ZX81's more novel features, a syntax checker that indicated errors in BASIC code as soon as it was entered rather than, as was standard at the time, only disclosing coding errors when a program was run . Unfortunately for Vickers, he introduced a briefly notorious error the so called square root bug that caused the square root of 0.25 to be returned erroneously as 1.3591409 as a result of problems with integrating the ZX Printer code into the ROM. Although it was eventually fixed, the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers. On a more positive note, Vickers' work on the manual was received favourably, being described in 1983 as one of the classic texts on BASIC . Max Phillips commented in a What Micro retrospective It does a reasonable job and sensibly provides lots for the reader to do. It's quite honest about the 's shortcomings and provides hints and tips for ways round them ... Best of all, the manual is complete and comprehensive. There's some fairly advanced and often undisclosed information in there. The beginner won't understand it for a long time but if he or she learns some more advanced ideas, the manual is ready for them. The task of designing the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80's wedge shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width , though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months. The ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions though with identical components a pre assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business. This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources to deal with the demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra 20 ROM chip into the circuit board. The reliability of the ZX81 was controversial. W.H. Smith, one of the machine's key distributors, had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale, so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines. Similar problems were reported in the US market, where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked. However, figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2.4 per cent of pre assembled machines were returned, although 13 per cent of kits were returned. Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability We have a lower rate of failure on our computers than anybody else in the world, and the reason for that is that we do everything to keep the quality right. The ZX81 production line is a miracle of efficiency after all, one is made every 10 seconds. They go through the most amazing quality control. Also we have a far lower component count than anyone else. We have only four chips where everyone else has 40. Sinclair attributed the higher failure rate of the kits to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way, though the company admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre assembled ZX81s. The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair's lack of after sales service, which Robin Clarke of New Scientist described as one of the worst after sales performance records of any company ever established. The Financial Times observed that Clive Sinclair's offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired. The company's slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service. The marketing of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair's long standing marketing agency Primary Contact now part of Ogilvy Mather , which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was to continue doing so until 1985. Sinclair's entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the man on the street , who probably had little or no computer literacy. The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O'Reilly of MicroScope magazine described as a single minded user friendly strategy. Chris Fawkes, one of Primary Contact's directors, explained We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn't have to be a whizzkid to use one. As Clive Sinclair put it in a 1982 interview with Your Computer, There are two big markets. There is the hobbyist and the man in the street. The hobbyist was a dead certainty. We knew we could sell to him because we have so much experience of it and we were offering a better product. The much less certain prospect was the man in the street. There the view was that if we offered him a computer plus a self training book at a keen enough price he would buy by mail order which, of course, he has. According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer. Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer. He does, and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly. A New Scientist retrospective published in 1986 commented Sir Clive's marketing achievement was to downgrade the concept of a computer to the point where he could claim to provide one for less than the magical 100 mark. To this end, efficient keyboards and monitors, useful amounts of memory, efficient filing and storage systems and the like were stripped away, to leave an affordable facsimile of a computer . The market image was more important than what the computer could do, but the burgeoning industry in computer games provided an application which adolescents young and old eagerly seized on as the raison d'etre for their new gadget. In the main, it was ignorance of genuine computer technology that fired the success of the ZX range, despite the availability of accessories that, albeit inefficiently, turned the Z80 processor chip at the heart of these up market toys into the core of a useful machine. High profile advertising was central to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long standing policy of using large scale advertisements that stood out in stark contrast to the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye catching drawings and photographs on double page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer the heart of a system that grows with you . The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs. The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed it's still very simple to teach yourself computing and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke the result of the memory saving method of using one byte tokens to represent keywords was presented as eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing . The ZX81's British character was emphasised it was designed by Sinclair and custom built in Britain. Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose For less than 100, the Sinclair ZX81 will get you started in personal computing right now. Your children will gain an understanding of computers that will benefit them for the rest of their lives. And you will be prepared to make informed decisions about using and buying computers, both in your career and in your home. This approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair's reliance on mail order marketing. It came with a high up front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over the counter sales by getting the story across , as Clive Sinclair put it Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops. Sinclair himself became a focal point for the marketing campaign, putting a human face on the business, while Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a plucky British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations. As David O'Reilly noted, by astute use of public relations, particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world, Sinclair has become the best known name in micros. The popular press soon latched onto the image. His Uncle Clive persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for Personal Computer World, while the media praised Sinclair as a visionary genius or even, in the words of The Sun, the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo. As Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy put it, Sinclair outgrew the role of microcomputer manufacturer and accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia. Pricing was central to the marketing strategy, as it had been through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a 70 price point and was launched at a price of 69.95 built or 49.95 kit . One Sinclair brochure presented a side by side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS 80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from 630 in the case of the Apple II Plus to just 70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine. According to Sinclair himself, the 69.95 price was chosen after applying the experience curve developed by the Boston Consulting Group. Sinclair's prior experience in the calculator market had highlighted the fact that a product will be more profitable selling at for instance twice the manufactured cost than at three times. He could have launched the ZX81 at a higher price, marketing it in a more traditional way as a premium product, but chose not to. In effect, he used the lower price to establish an unassailable lead before the competition moved in. An essential part of Sinclair's marketing strategy was to use regular cost cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy comment that Sinclair's approach was to secure and extend market lead and panic the competition. While most companies reduce prices when their products are in steep decline, Sinclair tends to discount shortly after sales have peaked. The advantage of his approach is that vacillating customers are drawn into the fold while the product's promotion retains a commercial urgency, and the costings of the competition are thrown into utter disarray. This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it had sold 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 computers were sold each month, 60 outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. When sales fell in the wake of the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre assembled version to 49.95 in May 1982. It was cut by another 10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold. The ZX81's distribution arrangements were an essential part of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail order retailer the ZX81 was initially available only through mail order but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book and magazine seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range. Smith's had begun selling audio and photographic equipment and calculators at the end of the 1970s, with a modest degree of success. In 1980 its marketing development manager, John Rowland, hit upon the idea of creating Computer Know How sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines. Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer. The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland's interest he approached Sinclair, saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith's on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch. As Rowland put it, what we've done now is bring the computer orientated publications together with an actual computer, to create the Computer Know How section of the store , alongside computer software and blank cassette tapes. The ZX81 would be sold in 112 stores around the UK and would serve as the centrepiece of the Computer Know How sections. Selling the ZX81 over the counter was seen as something of a gamble and Rowland's colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme. Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 1015 units per branch at launch. Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10,000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement, equivalent to one month's mail order sales by Sinclair. In the event, the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith's, it went on sale for 99 making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under 100. The Computer Know How sections were swamped with eager customers, overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines a Financial Times correspondent wrote of being dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W.H. Smith. Within a year, Smith's had sold 350,000 ZX81s, making an estimated net profit of 10 million. Sales of peripherals, software, books and magazines netted even more profit. The British chain stores Boots, John Menzies and Currys began selling the ZX81 as soon as Smith's exclusive distribution deal expired and a number of companies secured overseas distribution rights for the ZX81, which was being sold in 18 countries by March 1982. Sinclair launched the ZX81 in the United States in November 1981 at a price of 149.95 assembled and 99.95 in kit form, initially selling directly to the American market by mail order. To be useful the computer needed an extra 16 KB RAM pack which cost 49.95. Sales reached 15,000 a month by January 1982, while American Express sold thousands more to its own customers. In February 1982 Timex obtained a licence from Sinclair to sell the ZX81 directly through thousands of retail outlets in the US, paying Sinclair Research a 5 per cent royalty on all Sinclair hardware and software sold by Timex. The company was later to produce its own licensed clones and variants of the ZX81. By August 1982 Sinclair had lowered the American mail order price of the assembled ZX81 to 99.95 and kit to 79.95, and its advertisements stated that more than 10,000 are sold every week . In December 1981 Mitsui obtained rights to distribute the ZX81 in Japan, selling it by mail order for 38,700 equivalent to 83 in 1982 prices , and had sold 5,000 units by July 1982. The Japanese market's favourable reaction to the ZX81 led Mitsui to begin selling the ZX81 over the counter in large bookshops from September 1982, with annual sales of 20,000 units predicted. In the Netherlands, the regular Sinclair ZX81 was for sale as well as a Bang Olufsen branded version called Beocomp. The ZX81 was also sold for a while in duty free shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market. Reviews of the ZX81 highlighted the great value for money offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer, the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment . He applauded the improvements that had been made over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 a very good first computer that will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost. However, the built in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was mandatory for any worthwhile use . He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly. New Scientist's Malcolm Peltu commented that it was great technical value for money particularly for computing enthusiasts but thought that others were likely to be bored very quickly by the basic system . He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair's accompanying software, criticising them for a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should and questioned whether it might be more worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore's offerings. Overall, he concluded, the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing, but the Sinclair systems have a long way to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer based information systems among computer unbelievers. While the editor of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a chimpanzee with the machine above the strapline Editor benchtests the ZX81 . The chimp returned in later issues to benchtest all of Sinclair's subsequent computers. The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented absolutely amazing value for money . He described the ZX81 as a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg and concluded If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun. Paul Taylor of the Financial Times found the ZX81 to be a powerful and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun introduction to the mysteries of home computing but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready made software, the keyboard was not easy to use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade style games and its built in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do, it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing. The Age described the ZX81 as not extremely sophisticated, and its memory capability is rather limited. It also has a rather toy like appearance . It concluded that the computer was an ideal toy for youngsters who want to become acquainted with the computer world. It is responsive, cheap, and very easy to use . Billy Garrett of Byte, who already owned a ZX80, complimented the Timex Sinclair 1000's manual although he regretted the removal of the British original's humour , the state of the art circuitry , and the BASIC for being remarkably powerful despite the small ROM size. He concluded that the major use ... will probably be for learning about BASIC or computers in general. has limited expansion capabilities, and the keyboard is too small and cramped for any serious work . David Babsky described the ZX81 as a wonderfully brainy little micro which won't let you waste your time and make a fool of yourself . In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in Which Micro , he commended the ZX81's user friendliness and its on the fly syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro. The success of the ZX81 led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software. Clive Sinclair was amused and gratified by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as a few remarkably poor programs on cassette made little effort to exploit the demand, effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers, a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings. W.H. Smith, for instance, was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX81 owners found that technically obsolete low fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher quality music systems. Smith's purchased cheap shoebox cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W.H. Smiths logo as data recorders . Over 100,000 were sold in 18 months. Sinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16 KB RAM pack actually the same one previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector at the rear of the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of 49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double sided tape or Blu Tack to cure what became known as the RAM pack wobble problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time. Many non Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64 KB of extra memory and promising to fit snugly ... giving a firm connection to the computer, typewriter style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators, and even a hard disk interface, which Clive Sinclair thought was quite overgilding the lily . A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair compatible hardware. The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the Financial Times noted, school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians have set up small operations in their own time . The ZX81's popularity was publicly demonstrated in January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a ZX Microfair at Westminster Central Hall. Seventy exhibitors set up stalls with only a few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people. More than 12,000 people came and the police had to control the crowd. Thousands, many of whom had travelled long distances, queued outside for up to three hours to get into the hall Clarke, who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist, wrote that no one knows how many gave up in despair . The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds' worth of software and hardware as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes , he added. The fair also showed Sinclair Research's relatively unimportant role in the computer's success, with only small crowds at its booth compared to the rugby scrum elsewhere. By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held. Thousands of ZX81 programs were published, either as printed listings that could be typed in or as ready made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape. Many computer magazines featured ZX81 program listings some, such as Sinclair Programs, were dedicated entirely to listings while many individuals became the archetypal bedroom programmers , producing games and applications which they produced, marketed, recorded, and sold from their own homes. Some went on to found their own software houses, employing teams of programmers some of whom were still at school to produce programs for the ZX81 and other computers. Existing companies also sold software Psion produced a series of ZX81 programs in close association with Sinclair, including a flight simulator, while ICL's range of ZX81 programs sold over 100,000 cassettes in less than three months. Psion's success with the ZX81 had a profound effect on the future of the company. Its work on the ZX81 database program Vu File led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants, which resulted in the launch in 1984 of the Psion Organiser, the world's first handheld personal computer. Some of the most popular ZX81 games Psion's Flight Simulation being an example were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine's colour and sound capabilities. Enterprising programmers were able to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text characters and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark in the history of computer and video games. One of the more bizarre software products for the ZX81 came about as a result of music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum. Sinclair's licensing agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 both variants of the ZX81 and the Timex Sinclair 2068 a variant of the ZX Spectrum . The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re branding and the addition of an extra 1 KB of memory, totalling 2 KB. In the five months following the TS1000's launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over 1.2 million in royalties. Timex produced a second version of the ZX81 in the form of the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory. In addition, consumers' attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK. Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June 1981 that our competitors thought that consumers didn't want to learn programming. We think they failed because of this and because of price. Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption. The TS1000 ZX81's price advantage was erased when its main rivals the Texas Instruments TI99 4A and the Commodore VIC 20 had their prices cut to below the all important 100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound. By late 1983 Wayne Green reported a rising chorus of frustrated Timex users who are telling friends not to waste their money. Hard core early adopters, he wrote, became discouraged with the quality of the product, with the poverty of software available and with the almost total lack of information on how to cope with it. Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and, as publishers of programming guides found to their cost, the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming. American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines. Burned by this experience, many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether. Some companies outside the US and UK produced their own pirate versions of the ZX81 and Timex Sinclair computers, aided by weak intellectual property laws in their countries of origin. Several Brazilian companies produced ZX81 clones, notably the TK series such as the TK85 from Microdigital Eletronica of Brazil and Prologica's CP 200. Czerweny Electronica of Argentina produced the CZ1000 and CZ1500, clones of the ZX81 and TS1500 respectively. Lambda Electronics of Hong Kong produced the Lambda 3000, based on the ZX81, which was itself widely copied by other Chinese manufacturers. The machines were not all straight copies of the ZX81 some, such as the CP 200, came with extra memory and a larger case often with a chiclet keyboard in place of the original membrane keyboard . One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper. The ZX81 had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company's profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of 818,000 on a turnover of 4.6 million in 198081 to 8.55 million on a turnover of 27.17 million in 198182. Clive Sinclair became one of the UK's highest profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a 1 million bonus on top of a salary of 13,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983. The machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom, according to Clive Sinclair, purchasers of the ZX81 came from a reasonably broad spectrum that ranged from readers of the upmarket Observer and Sunday Times newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous Sun readers. The largest age group was around 30 years old. The Financial Times reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes, both for adults and children, though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX81 was subtly different from the run of the mill social fad although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties, many were older users often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children. However, the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male dominated. One of the ZX81's key legacies was that it spurred large numbers of people to try programming for the first time. The ZX81 plays a significant part in the plot of William Gibson's 2003 novel Pattern Recognition. One character, an artist using old ZX81s as a sculptural medium, explains the cultural and intellectual impact that the machine had on British society Walking on, he explains to her that Sinclair, the British inventor, had a way of getting things right, but also exactly wrong. Foreseeing the market for affordable personal computers, Sinclair decided that what people would want to do with them was to learn programming. The ZX81, marketed in the United States as the Timex 1000, cost less than the equivalent of a hundred dollars, but required the user to key in programs, tapping away on that little motel keyboard sticker. This had resulted both in the short market life of the product and, in Voytek's opinion, twenty years on, in the relative preponderance of skilled programmers in the United Kingdom. They had their heads turned by these little boxes, he believes, and by the need to program them... ... But if Timex sold it in the United States, she asks him, why didn't we get the programmers You have programmers, but America is different. America wanted Nintendo. Nintendo gives you no programmers. Also, on launch of product in America, RAM expansion unit did not ship for three months. People buy computer, take it home, discover it does almost nothing. A disaster. Among those whose first experience of home computing was provided by the ZX81 are Terry Pratchett who used it for very primitive word processing , Edward de Bono and perhaps proving William Gibson's point many video game developers including Charles Cecil, Raffaele Cecco, Pete Cooke, David Perry whose first published game, a driving game, involved a black blob avoiding other black blobs , Rhianna Pratchett, and Jon Ritman. Even 30 years after launch, the ZX81 has a German user forum, and one in English. New hardware and software continue to be developed for the ZX81, including a ZX81 based webserver the ZXpand, a combined SD card interface, 32K configurable memory expansion, and optional joystick port and AY sound interface and new games on cassette tape by Revival Studios, such as Avalanche, Mayhem, Down, Stairrunner and more.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81
"Zydokomuna , Polish for Judeo Communism related to Jewish Bolshevism is a pejorative antisemitic stereotype suggesting that most Jews collaborated with the Soviet Union in importing Communism into Poland or that there was an exclusively Jewish conspiracy to do so. Some Poles saw communism as part of a wider Jewish led conspiracy to seize power, despite Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's antisemitism and other Communists' view of religious, bourgeois, and Zionist Jews as enemies of communism. The stereotype of Zydokomuna originated as anti Communist propaganda at the time of the Polish Soviet War 191921 and continued through the interwar period, despite only 2 7 of Polish Jews having voted for the Communist Party and its fronts, while most Polish Jews supported the Pisudski government. After Pisudski died in 1935, rising state antisemitism attracted secular, non Zionist Polish Jews to a Soviet alternative in the 1939 1941 Soviet annexation of eastern Poland, the stereotype was reinforced when Moscow initially put local Polish Jewish Communists in positions of authority before replacing them with their own officials. The Jew communism stereotype endured in postwar Poland 194556 because Polish anti communists saw Poland's Soviet controlled Communist government as the fruition of prewar Communist anti Polish agitation and associated it with the Soviets' appointment of Jews to positions of responsibility in the Polish government. The stereotype was again reinforced by the prominent role of a small number of Jews in Poland's Stalinist regime 37.1 of postwar Poland's Security Office and Communist authorities were of Jewish origin, a group that was less than 1 of the total Polish population. It was described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets. Some Polish historians have questioned the loyalty of Jews who returned to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover of Poland, raising concern about potential revival of the Zydokomuna concept. According to some sources, the concept of a Jewish conspiracy threatening Polish social order dates in print to the pamphlet Rok 3333 czyli sen niesychany The Year 3333, or the Incredible Dream by Polish Enlightenment author and political activist Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, written in 1817 and published posthumously in 1858. Called the first Polish work to develop on a large scale the concept of an organized Jewish conspiracy directly threatening the existing social structure, it describes a Warsaw of the future renamed Moszkopolis after its Jewish ruler. See Judeopolonia article for more. At the end of the 19th century, Roman Dmowski's National Democratic party characterized Poland's Jews and other opponents of Dmowski's party as internal enemies who were behind international conspiracies inimical to Poland and who were agents of disorder, disruption and socialism. Historian Antony Polonsky writes that before World War I The National Democrats brought to Poland a new and dangerous ideological fanaticism, dividing society into 'friends' and 'enemies' and resorting constantly to conspiratorial theories Jewish Masonic plot Zydokomuna Jew communism to explain Poland's difficulties. Meanwhile, some Jews played into National Democratic rhetoric by their participation in exclusively Jewish organizations such as the Bund and the Zionist movement, even as other Jews zealously participated in institutions such as the Polish Army and Jozef Pisudski's ideologically multicultural Sanation regime. According to Joanna Michlic, the image of the secularized and radically left wing Jew who aims to take over and undermine the foundations of the Christian world dates back to the first half of the 19th century, to the writings of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Zygmunt Krasinski by the end of the 19th century it has become part of the political discourse in Poland. The term Zydokomuna originated in connection with the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish Communists during the PolishSoviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Zydokomuna came to be seen as a prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia. Accusations of Zydokomuna accompanied the incidents of anti Jewish violence in Poland during PolishSoviet War of 1920, legitimized as self defense against a people who were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anti Communist sentiment was implicated in anti Jewish violence and killings in a number of towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwow pogrom during the PolishUkrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the PolishSoviet War served to heighten anti Jewish sentiment. The concept of Zydokomuna was widely illustrated in Polish interwar politics, including publications by the National Democrats and the Catholic Church that expressed anti Jewish views. During World War II, the term Zydokomuna was made to resemble the Jewish Bolshevism rhetoric of Nazi Germany, wartime Romania and other war torn countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The National Democrats Endeks emerged from the 1930 Polish elections to Sejm as the main opposition party to the Pisudski government. Pisudski had a liberal attitude towards minorities, and was respected by much of the Polish Jewish minority. In the midst of the Great Depression and in a climate of widespread nationalist and antisemitic sentiment, the Endeks expressed anti Jewish sentiment to show their dissatisfaction with the government. The Endeks called for reducing the numbers of Jews in the country and for an economic boycott launched in 1931 subsequently, outbreaks of violence occurred against Jews, particularly at universities. Following the death of Pisudski in 1935, the Endeks moved towards seizing power in Poland, and began to focus more fully on the Jews. While there was a limited audience for Endek rhetoric, it was supplemented by the much larger circulation enjoyed by Catholic Church publications, which increasingly referred to the Communist threat and the alleged Godlessness of the Jews. One such Church publication, the newspaper Samoobrona Narodu Self Defense of the Nation , had a circulation of 25 thousand. In the period between the two world wars, Zydokomuna sentiment grew concurrently in Poland with the notion of the criminal Jew. Statistics from the 1920s had indicated a Jewish crime rate that was well below the percentage of Jews in the population. However, a subsequent reclassification of how crime was recordedwhich now included minor offensessucceeded in reversing the trend, and Jewish criminal statistics showed an increase relative to the Jewish population by the 1930s. These statistics were seen by some Poles, particularly within the right wing press, to confirm the image of the criminal Jew additionally, political crimes by Jews were more closely scrutinized, enhancing fears of a criminal Zydokomuna. Another important factor was the dominance of Jews in the leadership of the Communist Party of Poland KPP . According to multiple sources, Jews were well represented in the Polish Communist Party. Notably, the party had strong Jewish representation at higher levels. Out of fifteen leaders of the KPP central administration in 1936, eight were Jews. Jews constituted 53 of the active members of the KPP, 75 of its publication apparatus, 90 of the international department for help to revolutionaries and 100 of the technical apparatus of the Home Secretariat. In Polish court proceedings against communists between 1927 and 1936, 90 of the accused were Jews. In terms of membership, before its dissolution in 1938, 25 of KPP members were Jews most urban KPP members were Jewsa substantial number, given an 8.7 Jewish minority in prewar Poland. Some historians, including Joseph Marcus, qualify these statistics, alleging that the KPP should not be considered a Jewish party, as it was in fact in opposition to traditional Jewish economic and national interests. The Jews supporting KPP saw themselves as international Communists and rejected much of the Jewish culture and tradition. Nonetheless, the KPP, along with the Polish Socialist Party, was notable for its decisive stand against antisemitism. According to Jaff Schatz's summary of Jewish participation in the prewar Polish Communist movement Throughout the whole interwar period, Jews constituted a very important segment of the Communist movement. According to Polish sources and to Western estimates, the proportion of Jews in the KPP was never lower than 22 percent. In the larger cities, the percentage of Jews in the KPP often exceeded 50 percent and in smaller cities, frequently over 60 percent. Given this background, a respondent's statement that in small cities like ours, almost all Communists were Jews, does not appear to be a gross exaggeration. It was the disproportionately large representation of Jews in the communist leadership that led to Zydokomuna sentiment being widely expressed in contemporary Polish politics. According to some bodies of research, voting patterns in Poland's parliamentary elections in the 1920s revealed that Jewish support for the Communists was proportionally less than their representation in the total population. In this view, most support for Poland's Communist and pro Soviet parties came not from Jews, but rather from Ukrainian and Eastern Orthodox Christian Belarusian voters,. Schatz notes that even if post war claims by Jewish communists that 40 of the 266,528 Communist votes on several lists of front organizations at the 1928 Sejm election came from the Jewish community were true a claim that one source describes as almost certainly an exaggeration , this would amount to no more than 5 of Jewish votes for the communists, indicating the Jewish population at large was far from sympathetic to communism. Even if Jews were prominent in the Communist Party leadership, this prominence did not translate into support at the mass level wrote Jeffrey Kopstein and Jason Wittenberg, who analyzed the communist vote in interwar Poland. Only 7 of Jewish voters supported Communists at the polls in 1928, while 93 of them supported non communists with 49 voting for Pisudski . The pro Soviet communist party received most of its support from Belarusians whose separatism was backed by the Soviet Union and had been radicalized between 1922 and 1928 by a combination of Polish discrimination against them and Soviet interference in Polish politics whereas 7 of Jewish voters supported Communists in 1928, 44 of Eastern Orthodox voters did, including around 25 of Orthodox Ukrainians and a figure likely rather higher than 44 among Belarusians. In Lwow, the CPP received 4 of the vote of which 35 was Jewish , in Warsaw 14 33 Jewish , and in Wilno 0.02 36 Jewish . Among communist voters, Jews were not particularly prominent eitheronly 14 of the communist vote came from Jews, less than the 16 which came from Catholics, and most of the rest coming from Orthodox Christians. While one viewpoint explains the high level of Jewish support for Pilsudski, higher than any other group, as Jews turning to him as a protector, another view holds that when faced with threats of a nationalizing ethnic Polish state, whereas Belarusians tended to turn to pro Soviet exit strategies and Uniate Ukrainians threw their weight behind ethnic interest parties, Jews instead took a different strategy of showing their loyalty to Poland Even in the face of both public and private prejudice... Most Jews were thus politically neither internationalist nor ethnically exclusionary, as a large vote for the minority parties in 1928 would have indicated. Rather they were casting their lot with the Polish state... Our data do not speak to whether Jews were disproportionately represented among the leadership of interwar Poland's communist parties. Yet even if this were true... it means the Jews did not vote communist even when their co ethnics were leading the communist parties. Following the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, resulting in the partition of Polish territory between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union USSR , Jewish communities in eastern Poland welcomed with some relief the Soviet occupation, which they saw as a lesser of two evils than openly antisemitic Nazi Germany. The image of Jews among the Belorussian and Ukrainian minorities waving red flags to welcome Soviet troops had great symbolic meaning in Polish memory of the period. Jan T. Gross noted that there were proportionately more communist sympathizers among Jews than among any other nationality in the local population . Secular and non Zionist young Jews joined or organized communist militias, others organized a new, communist, temporary self government. Such militias often disarmed and arrested Polish soldiers, policemen and other authority figures often, Poles and the Polish states were mocked. In the days and weeks following the events of September 1939, the Soviets engaged in a harsh policy of Sovietization. Polish schools and other institutions were closed, Poles were dismissed from jobs of authority, often arrested and deported, and replaced with non Polish personnel. At the same time, 100,000 Jewish Poles fought to defend Poland against the Nazi Soviet invasion, while at least 434 Polish Jews who had been awarded officer rank by the Polish Army were murdered by the Soviets in the Katyn Massacre because of their loyalty to Poland. Many Poles resented their change of fortunes because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position compared to other ethnic groups of the Second Republic. Then, in the space of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland mainly Ukrainians and Belorussians occupied newly vacant positions in the Soviet occupation government and administrationsuch as teachers, civil servants and engineerspositions that some claimed they had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jewsespecially Polish Communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the undergroundan opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Maa. Such events implanted in the Polish collective memory the image of Jewish crowds greeting the invading Red Army as liberators, and willing collaborators, further strengthening Zydokomuna sentiment that held Jews responsible for collaboration with the Soviet authorities in importing communism into divided Poland. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, widespread notion of Judeo Communism, combined with the German Nazi encouragement for expression of antisemitic attitudes, may have been a principal cause of massacres of Jews by gentile Poles in Poland's northeastern omza province in the summer of 1941, including the massacre at Jedwabne according to Joanna B. Michlic. Though some Jews had initially benefited from the effects of the Soviet invasion, this occupation soon began to strike at the Jewish population as well independent Jewish organizations were abolished and Jewish activists were arrested. Hundreds of thousands of Jews who had fled to the Soviet sector were given a choice of Soviet citizenship or returning to the German occupied zone. The majority chose the latter, and instead found themselves deported to the Soviet Union, where, ironically, 300,000 would escape the Holocaust. While there was Polish Jewish representation in the London based Polish government in exile, relations between the Jews in Poland and Polish resistance in occupied Poland were strained, and Jewish armed groups had difficulty joining the official Polish resistance umbrella organization, the Home Army in Polish, Armia Krajowa or AK . Some Jewish groups such as the Bielski partisans robbed local Polish peasants for food, also performing massacres and crimes like Naliboki massacre in 1943 in turn, the Polish underground often labeled those armed Jewish groups as bandits and robbers. Jewish partisans instead more often joined the Armia Ludowa of the communist Polish Workers' Party and Soviet guerrilla groups, which increasingly clashed with Polish guerillas, contributing to yet another perception of Jews working with the Soviets against the Poles. The Soviet backed Communist government was as harsh towards non Communist Jewish cultural, political and social institutions as they were towards Polish, banning all alternative parties. Thousands of Jews returned from exile in the Soviet Union, but as their number decreased with legalized aliyah to Israel, the PZPR members formed a much larger percentage of the remaining Jewish population. Among them were a number of Jewish communists who played a highly visible role in the unpopular Communist government and its security apparatus. Hilary Minc, the third in command in Bolesaw Bierut's political triumvirate of Stalinist leaders, became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry, Industry and Commerce, and the Economic Affairs. He was personally assigned by Stalin first to Industry and than to Transportation ministries of Poland. His wife, Julia, became the Editor in Chief of the monopolized Polish Press Agency. Minister Jakub Berman Stalin's right hand in Poland until 1953 held the Political propaganda and Ideology portfolios. He was responsible for the largest and most notorious secret police in the history of the People's Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Public Security UB , employing 33,200 permanent security officers, one for every 800 Polish citizens. The new government's hostility to the wartime Polish Government in Exile and its World War II underground resistance accused by the media of being nationalist, reactionary and antisemitic, and persecuted by Berman further strengthened Zydokomuna sentiment to the point where in the popular consciousness Jewish Bolshevism was seen as having conquered Poland. It was in this context, reinforced by the immediate post war lawlessness, that Poland experienced an unprecedented wave of anti Jewish violence of which most notable was the Kielce pogrom . According to Michael C. Steinlauf, the Polish communists who took power in Poland were mainly KPP members who sheltered in Moscow during the war, and included many Jews who thus survived the Holocaust. In addition, since Jews were excluded from the government of the Second Polish Republic, other Jews were attracted by the openness of the communist government to accept them. Some Jews changed their names to Polish sounding name, fueling speculation of hidden Jews in subsequent decades. However, Steinlauf notes that the reality of Jewish representation in government was nowhere near the Zydokomuna stereotype. In parallel, Steinlauf notes that 1,500 to 2,000 Jews were murdered between 1944 and 1947 in the worse spate of anti Jewish violence in the history of Polish Jewish relations. These attacks were accompanied by classic blood libel, brought international notoriety to Poland, and reinforced the notion that the Communist government was the sole force that could protect the Jews. However, most Jews were convinced by the widespread pogroms that Poland held no future for them. By 1951, when the government banned immigration to Israel, only 80,000 Jews remained in Poland and many of them did so since they believed in the Communist government. The combination of the effects of the Holocaust and postwar antisemitism led to a dramatic mass emigration of Polish Jewry in the immediate postwar years. Of the estimated 240,000 Jews in Poland in 1946 of whom 136,000 were refugees from the Soviet Union, most on their way to the West , only 90,000 remained a year later. Regarding this period, Andre Gerrits wrote in his study of Zydokomuna, that even though for the first time in history they had entered the top echelons of power in considerable numbers, The first post war decade was a mixed experience for the Jews of East Central Europe. The new Communist order offered unprecedented opportunities as well as unforeseen dangers. During Stalinism, the preferred Soviet policy was to keep sensitive posts in the hands of non Poles. As a result, all or nearly all of the directors of the widely despised Ministry of Public Security of Poland were Jewish as noted by Polish journalist Teresa Toranska among others. A recent study by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance showed that out of 450 people in director positions in the Ministry between 1944 and 1954, 167 37.1 were of Jewish ethnicity, while Jews made up only 1 of the post war Polish population. While Jews were overrepresented in various Polish Communist organizations, including the security apparatus, relative to their percentage of the general population, the vast majority of Jews did not participate in the Stalinist apparatus, and indeed most were not supportive of Communism. Krzysztof Szwagrzyk has quoted Jan T. Gross, who argued that many Jews who worked for the communist party cut their ties with their culture Jewish, Polish or Russian and tried to represent the interests of international communism only, or at least that of the local communist government. It is difficult to assess when the Polish Jews who had volunteered to serve or remain in the postwar communist security forces began to realize, however, what Soviet Jews had realized earlier, that under Stalin, as Arkady Vaksberg put it if someone named Rabinovich was in charge of a mass execution, he was perceived not simply as a Cheka boss but as a Jew... Among the notable Jewish officials of the Polish secret police and security services were Minister Jakub Berman, Joseph Stalin's right hand in the PRL Vice minister Roman Romkowski head of MBP , Dir. Julia Brystiger 5th Dept. , Dir. Anatol Fejgin 10th Dept. or the notorious Special Bureau , deputy Dir. Jozef Swiato 10th Dept. , Col. Jozef Rozanski among others. Swiato a torture master defected to the West in 1953, while Romkowski and Rozanski would find themselves among the Jewish scapegoats for Polish Stalinism in the political upheavals following Stalin's death, both sentenced to 15 years in prison on 11 November 1957 for gross violations of human rights law and abuse of power, but released 1964. In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist politicians were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries of the security forces were brought to court in the process of de Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomuka were Jews. Wadysaw Gomuka was captured by Swiato, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomuka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization of the security forces as a Jewish institutionas disseminated in the post war anticommunist press at various timeswas rooted in Zydokomuna the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post war view of Jews as agents of the security forces. The Zydokomuna sentiment reappeared at times of severe political and socioeconomic crises in Stalinist Poland. After the death of Polish United Workers' Party leader Bolesaw Bierut in 1956, a de Stalinization and a subsequent battle among rival factions looked to lay blame for the excesses of the Stalin era. According to L.W. Gluchowski Polands Communists had grown accustomed to placing the burden of their own failures to gain sufficient legitimacy among the Polish population during the entire Communist period on the shoulders of Jews in the party. See above. As described in one historical account, the party hardline Natolin faction used anti Semitism as a political weapon and found an echo both in the party apparatus and in society at large, where traditional stereotypes of an insidious Jewish cobweb of political influence and economic gain resurfaced, but now in the context of 'Judeo Communism,' the Zydokomuna. Natolin leader Zenon Nowak entered the concept of Judeo Stalinization and placed the blame for the party's failures, errors and repression on the Jewish apparatchiks. Documents from this period chronicle antisemitic attitudes within Polish society, including beatings of Jews, loss of employment, and persecution. These outbursts of antisemitic sentiment from both Polish society and within the rank and file of the ruling party spurred the exodus of some 40,000 Polish Jews between 1956 and 1958. Zydokomuna sentiment was reignited by Polish state propaganda as part of the 1968 Polish political crisis. Political turmoil of the late 1960sexemplified in the West by increasingly violent protests against the Vietnam Warwas closely associated in Poland with the events of the Prague Spring which began on 5 January 1968, raising hopes of democratic reforms among the intelligentsia. The crisis culminated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on 20 August 1968. The repressive government of Wadysaw Gomuka responded to student protests and strike actions across Poland Warsaw, Krakow with mass arrests, and by launching an anti Zionist campaign within the communist party on the initiative of Interior Minister Mieczysaw Moczar aka Mikoaj Diomko, known for his xenophobic and antisemitic attitude . The officials of Jewish descent were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The campaign, which began in 1967, was a well guided response to the Six Day War and the subsequent break off by the Soviets of all diplomatic relations with Israel. Polish factory workers were forced to publicly denounce Zionism. As the interior minister Mieczysaw Moczar's nationalist Partisan faction became increasingly influential in the Communist party, infighting within the Polish Communist party led one faction to again make scapegoats of the remaining Polish Jews, attempting to redirect public anger at them. After Israel's victory in the war, the Polish government, following the Soviet lead, launched an antisemitic campaign under the guise of anti Zionism, with both Moczar's and Party Secretary Wadysaw Gomuka's factions playing leading roles. However, the campaign did not resonate with the general public, because most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence. Many Poles felt pride in the success of the Israeli military, which was dominated by Polish Jews. The slogan, Our Jews beat the Soviet Arabs was very popular among the Poles, but contrary to the desire of the Communist government. The government's antisemitic policy yielded more successes the next year. In March 1968, a wave of unrest among students and intellectuals, unrelated to the Arab Israeli War, swept Poland the events became known as the March 1968 events . The campaign served multiple purposes, most notably the suppression of protests, which were branded as inspired by a fifth column of Zionists it was also used as a tactic in a political struggle between Gomuka and Moczar, both of whom played the Jewish card in a nationalist appeal. The campaign resulted in an actual expulsion from Poland in two years, of thousands of Jewish professionals, party officials and state security functionaries. Ironically, the Moczar's faction failed to topple Gomuka with their propaganda efforts. As historian Dariusz Stola notes, the anti Jewish campaign combined century old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic claims and classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Zydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested Paradoxically, probably the most powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest as a tool of communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism the Jews were the dark side of communism what was wrong in communism was due to them. The communist elites used the Jews as Zionists allegations to push for a purge of Jews from scientific and cultural institutions, publishing houses, and national television and radio stations. Ultimately, the communist government sponsored an antisemitic campaign that resulted in most remaining Jews being forced to leave Poland. Moczar's Partisan faction promulgated an ideology that has been described as an eerie reincarnation of the views of the pre World War II National Democracy Party, and even at times exploiting Zydokomuna sentiment. Stola also notes that one of the effects of the 1968 antisemitic campaign was to thoroughly discredit the communist government in the eyes of the public. As a result, when the concept of the Jew as a threatening other was employed in the 1970s and 1980s in Poland by the communist government in its attacks on the political opposition, including the Solidarity trade union movement and the Workers' Defence Committee Komitet Obrony Robotnikow, or KOR , it was completely unsuccessful. Historiography of Zydokomuna remains controversial. Works such as those by Jan T. Gross have polarized debate over anti Jewish violence in Poland, with Gross and his supporters characterizing Zydokomuna as an antisemitic cliche while to some of his critics general and widespread Polish Jewish collaboration with communism is a fact of history. According to Gross's supporters, the strength of the Zydokomuna belief stemmed from age old Polish fears of Russia and from anti communist and antisemitic attitudes. Schatz writes that because antisemitism was one of the main forces that drew Jews to the Communist movement, Zydokomuna meant turning the effects of antisemitism into a cause of its further increase. Zydokomuna boosted antisemitism by amplifying ideas about an alleged Jewish world conspiracy. According to this thinking, Bolshevism and communism became the modern means to the long attempted Jewish political conquest of Poland the Zydokomuna conspirators would finally succeed in establishing a 'Judeo Polonia.' Subscribers to this theory maintain that there was a strong tradition of antisemitism which provided a base for Zydokomuna to feed upon. These sources claim that many Poles likely exaggerated Jewish participation in the Soviet occupation because a Jewish presence in the government apparatus was a novel phenomenon in pre war Poland. Critics of these sources, such as Niall Ferguson, claim that much of the anti Jewish sentiment was justified due to the disproportionate influence of Jewish communists in carrying out Soviet policies. According to Ferguson, The entire Polish population adopted a negative attitude towards the Jews because of their blatant cooperation with the Bolsheviks and their hostility against non Jews. Historian Omer Bartov has written that recent writings and pronouncements seem to indicate that the myth of the Zydokomuna Jews as communists has not gone away as evidenced by the writings of younger Polish scholars such as Marek Chodakiewicz, contending Jewish disloyalty to Poland during the Soviet occupation. Historians Joanna B. Michlic and Laurence Weinbaum charge that post 1989 Polish historiography has seen a revival of an ethnonationalist historical approach . According to Michlic, among some Polish historians, served the purpose of rationalizing and explaining the participation of ethnic Poles in killing their Jewish neighbors and, thus, in minimizing the criminal nature of the murder.

"Attus sexpunctatus Hentz, 1845 Zygoballus sexpunctatus is a species of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States where it can be found in a variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5 mm in length. The cephalothorax and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae the mouthparts used for grasping prey and front femora the third, and typically largest, leg segments . Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior. The specific name is derived from the Latin sex meaning six and punctum meaning spot . This is a reference to the six spots typically occurring on the abdomen of the male. The species was first described by entomologist Nicholas Marcellus Hentz in 1845 in the Boston Journal of Natural History. Hentz named the species Attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows Black cephalothorax with the two posterior eyes near the base, which is wide and suddenly inclined at nearly a right angle with the upper surface, cheliceres with a strong inner tooth, and a long, curved fang abdomen with six dots, and a line in front, white feet, 1. 4. 2. 3., first pair with enlarged thighs and quite long. Hentz classified A. sexpunctatus in the subgeneric group Pugnatoriae, which consisted of jumping spiders whose first pair of legs were the longest, followed by the fourth pair. Later entomologists abandoned this classification, which Hentz himself admitted was somewhat artificial . In 1888, with the recognition of Zygoballus as an independent genus, American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham renamed the spider Zygoballus sexpunctatus. Specimens of Z. sexpunctatus are housed at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the British Museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle. No type specimens are known. The genus Zygoballus contains approximately twenty species distributed from the United States to Argentina. Zygoballus is classified in the subfamily Dendryphantinae of the family Salticidae jumping spiders . According to arachnologist B. J. Kaston, adult females are 3.5 to 4.5 mm in body length, while males are 3 to 3.5 mm. The Peckhams' earlier description, however, gives a length of 3 mm for females and 3 to 4.5 mm for males. The cephalothorax of Z. sexpunctatus is bronze to black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus face and chelicerae. This covering extends around the sides of the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang. The legs are reddish brown, or sometimes yellowish, with the femora of the anterior first pair being darker and enlarged, especially in the male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair 3.7 mm, 2.2 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually. The abdomen is bronze to black with a white basal band and two white transverse bands. The transverse bands are often broken to form six spots. Some or all of these spots may be lacking, however. Zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z. rufipes by the large spot of white scales at the beginning of the thoracic slope which is lacking in Z. rufipes , and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp Z. rufipes has a transverse division . The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne the external genital structure . The range of the species extends from New Jersey to Florida and west to Texas, although it is most commonly found in the southern states. Hentz collected his original specimen in North Carolina. In 1909, the Peckhams reported that the species had been collected from North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. A seven year survey of spider species in western Mississippi reported the abundance of Z. sexpunctatus as uncommon . A one year survey in Alachua County, Florida, reported the species as rare . Specimens have been collected from several ecosystems, including old fields, river terrace forests, flatwoods, Florida Sand Pine scrub, Slash Pine forests, Appalachian grass balds, and rice fields. Robert and Betty Barnes reported the species as occurring in broomsedge fields throughout the southeastern Piedmont. The species is typically found in the herb stratum among grasses and other short plants and may be collected with a sweep net. Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders are known to exhibit elaborate courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals. Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic behavior when encountering other males of the same species. This behavior may include many of the same elements as courtship, such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however. Like most spiders, Zygoballus sexpunctatus is an opportunistic feeder, feeding on a wide range of invertebrate prey. The spider's diet typically includes small insects such as aphids and young caterpillars. They have also been known to eat mosquitoes and numerous kinds of small spiders. Mud dauber wasps, which capture and paralyze spiders as a source of food for their larvae, have been shown to prey on both male and female Z. sexpunctatus spiders. In a study of spider populations in western Tennessee, Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were reported to hatch from egg sacs in mid summer. The spiders hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late April.

"Zygophyseter varolai is an extinct sperm whale that lived during the Tortonian Age of the Late Miocene 11.2 to 7.6 million years ago. It is known from a single specimen from the Pietra Leccese Formation in Italy. It was a member of a stem group of fossil macroraptorial sperm whales often shortened to raptorial also including Brygmophyseter, Acrophyseter, and Livyatan. It probably grew to be around 6.5 to 7 meters 21 to 23 ft in length and shared some characteristics with other raptorials, such as large teeth with tooth enamel that were functional in both the upper and lower jaws which the modern sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus lacks. It also had a beak, the ability to echolocate prey, and could have probably swum faster than the modern day sperm whale which goes 4 kilometers per hour 2.5 mph . These were probably used in the capture of large prey, such as large fish, seals, and whales. In fact, its common name, the killer sperm whale, refers to its feeding habits that would have had a resemblance to the modern day killer whale Orcinus orca . Eudelphis Zygophyseter Brygmophyseter Acrophyseter Livyatan Aulophyseter Orycterocetus Idiorophus Physeterula Idiophyseter Physeter Aulophyseter Placoziphius Diaphorocetus Aprixokogia Kogia Praekogia Scaphokogia Thalassocetus The type and only specimen, labelled MAUL 229 1, is of an almost complete skeleton discovered in southern Italy by geologist Angelo Varola in the marine lime mudstone of the Pietra Leccese Formation near the city of Lecce. It was described in 2006 by geologists Giovanni Bianucci and Walter Landini from the University of Pisa. The genus name Zygophyseter comes from the Latin word zygomaticus, which emphasizes the elongation of the zygomatic process of the only known species Z. varolai, and the term physeter refers to the modern day sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus of the family Physeteridae. The species name honors the discoverer. Zygophyseter is part of a fossil stem group of hyper predatory macroraptorial sperm whales often shortened to raptorial which also includes Brygmophyseter, Acrophyseter, and Livyatan. This group is characterized by having large, functional teeth on both the upper and lower jaw with an enamel coating whereas the modern sperm whale lacks enamel, teeth in the upper jaws, and functionality in the teeth for catching prey. Zygophyseter is more closely related to Brygmophyseter and Acrophyseter than to Livyatan, and the enlarged teeth of this group are thought to have evolved either from a common basilosaurid like ancestor, or independently once or twice within the group. Some fossil remains, mostly teeth, of the genus Scaldicetus were reassigned to these raptorials, including Z. varolai. Scaldicetus is now considered to be a grade taxon with reported specimens probably united only by similar physical characteristics rather than a shared ancestry as a clade. It has been proposed that these raptorials be placed into the extinct, possibly paraphyletic which would make it invalid subfamily Hoplocetinae, alongside Scaldicetus, Diaphorocetus, Idiorophus, and Hoplocetus. A characteristic of related raptorials, Zygophyseter had buccal exostoses, bony outgrowths in the alveolar ridge in the mouth, which are thought to have increased their bite force. Like other raptorials, it had large temporal fossae, probably for supporting strong temporal and masseter muscles, the strongest muscles between the skull and the jaw, meaning this adaptation allowed it to shut its jaws harder. The zygomatic bone cheekbone projects outward anteriorly , indicating it had a beak, which featured an abrupt narrowing this may have allowed it to clamp down on prey more effectively. The head probably took up 2123 of the total body size, compared to that of the modern sperm whale which takes up around one fourth to one third of the total body size. Like in other sperm whales, the blowhole was slanted towards the left side of the animal, and it may have lacked a right nasal passage. The falciform process on the squamosal bone was large and ventrally facing as opposed to the ones in the Kogiidae Kogia and Praekogia which are either reduced or absent. These may have been reduced in kogiids due to adaptations to deep sea diving. Like in modern sperm whales, Zygophyseter had a very large basin above the braincase, known as the supracranial basin, which probably housed the spermaceti organ and the melon. These are used in the generation and focusing of sound for biosonar in the modern sperm whale, indicating Zygophyseter had some mechanisms for biosonar that is to say this animal could have used echolocation. The zygomatic processes of the temporal bone on the cheeks were elongated probably because they supported the spermaceti organ. The skull features a pronounced slope into the supracranial basin. It probably had an echolocation system similar to that of the modern sperm whale, and Zygophyseter may have, in comparison to the echolocative abilities of other modern toothed whales, produced smaller bandwidths and lower center frequencies. This would have made it inept at detecting anything that did not have a diameter of at least 1 meter 3 ft 3 in . Zygophyseter had 28 teeth in the lower jaws and 26 in the upper jaws. The curvature of the teeth increased medially, that is, the teeth in the front of the mouth were straighter than the teeth in the back of the mouth. The back teeth featured more wear than the front teeth. Like Brygmophyseter, it had a relatively small crown, making up only 18 of the tooth. Killer whales Orcinus orca , in comparison, have crowns that make up 2025 of the tooth. Other characteristics include the presence of the gumline below the crown root boundary meaning that part of the root was exposed , and longitudinal grooves on the root. In the type specimen, the teeth ranged in height from 150 to 250 millimeters 5.9 to 9.8 in with an average height of 175.6 mm 6.91 in , and ranged in diameter from 47 to 56 mm 1.9 to 2.2 in with an average of 52.4 mm 2.06 in . Like in other raptorials, and unlike in the modern sperm whale, Zygophyseter had tooth enamel. Like in Acrophyseter, the mandibular foramen takes up about 40 of the lower jawbone. The teeth of the upper jaw form an angle of nearly 120 between the crown and the root, which is possibly a characteristic shared by all raptorials. Zygophyseter could reach an estimated length of 6.5 to 7 meters 21 to 23 ft , compared to the 12.5 to 18.5 metre 41 to 61 ft modern sperm whale. It is thought that this whale had twelve thoracic vertebrae and at least ten lumbar vertebrae. The type specimen had only 8 thoracic vertebrae preserved, and only the atlas of the neck vertebrae. Like in the modern sperm whales, the neck vertebrae were probably not fused. The centrum of the thoracic vertebrae formed a large and almost pear shaped central canal which transports nutrients to the spinal cord. The width between the transverse processes the diagonal projections from a vertebral centrum of the thoracic vertebrae were 235 millimeters 9.3 in and the neural spine, the part of the spine that projects away from the centrum, is missing in the type specimen, but it was probably short and thin. The lumbar vertebrae were elongated and may have supported large multifidus and longissimus muscles in the back, likely larger than the modern sperm whale, and so it probably swam faster than the modern sperm whale the modern sperm whale typically travels horizontally at 4 kilometers per hour 2.5 mph , comparable to other large open ocean animals. The type specimen had eight caudal vertebrae in the tail. The animal probably had 12 ribs. The length of the ribs increased from the first to the fifth, then decreased from the fifth to the twelfth and the width of the ribs decreased from the first to the twelfth, similar to other cetaceans. Since the teeth of Zygophyseter are large, exhibit wearing not unlike the teeth of modern day killer whales, and had functionality in both the upper and lower jaws, it was likely a macropredator that fed on large fish, cephalopods, seals, and small cetaceans. The position of the condyloid processes between the jaw and the skull, like in the modern sperm whale, allowed it to open its jaw wider in order to grab large prey. Its apparent similarity to the feeding habits of the killer whale gave it its nickname killer sperm whale. The conical front teeth may have functioned as a means for gripping onto prey, and the back teeth were used for cutting. However, neither stomach contents nor cut marks on the bones of prey species have been discovered, and thus its diet is speculative. The Z. varolai specimen from the Pietra Leccese Formation dates back to the Tortonian Age of the Late Miocene Epoch, around 11.6 to 7.2 million years ago mya , and most likely inhabited the Paratethys Sea. This formation has also unearthed the remains of several other large vertebrate species. Ancient sirenians of the genus Metaxytherium were apparently common throughout the ancient Mediterranean sea. Many fish remains of teleost fish, rays, and at least twenty species of sharks have been discovered, such as the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier and the extinct Carcharocles megalodon. Three species of turtles have been identified Trachyaspis lardyi, Procolpochelys melii, which are both ancient marine turtles, and Psephophorus polygonus, an ancient leatherback sea turtle. Aside from Zygophyseter, two other cetacean species have been described from this formation the oldest known gray whale Archaeschrichtius ruggieroi, and a species of beaked whale Messapicetus longirostris.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygophyseter
"Zyklon B German listen translated Cyclone B was the trade name of a cyanide based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It consisted of hydrogen cyanide prussic acid , as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately one million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps. Hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration, was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s. Research at Degesch of Germany led to the development of Zyklon later known as Zyklon A , a pesticide which released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a chemical weapon. Degussa purchased Degesech in 1922. Their team of chemists, which included Walter Heerdt and Bruno Tesch, devised a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included delousing clothing and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains. The Nazis began using Zyklon B in extermination camps in early 1942 to murder prisoners during the Holocaust. Around a million people were killed using this method, mostly at Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but it still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974. Hydrogen cyanide is a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate ATP by binding to one of the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal to ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound thus, the heme group no longer accepts them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. Death occurs in a human being weighing 68 kilograms 150 lb within two minutes of inhaling 70 mg of hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide, discovered in the late 18th century, was used in the 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Schadlingsbekampfung mbH Degesch , a state controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon cyclone . As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned. Deutsche Gold und Silber Scheideanstalt German Gold and Silver Refinery Degussa became sole owners of Degesch in 1922. There, beginning in 1922, Walter Heerdt , Bruno Tesch, and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application number DE 438818 dated 20 June 1922. The Deutsches Patent und Markenamt awarded the patent on 27 December 1926. Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. Customs facilities along the Mexican border to fumigate the clothing of border crossers. In 1930, Degussa ceded 42.5 percent ownership of Degesch to IG Farben and 15 percent to Th. Goldschmidt AG, in exchange for the right to market pesticide products of those two companies through Degesch. Degussa retained managerial control. While Degesch owned the rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the packaging system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 percent owned by Degussa, owned the rights to a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors Heerdt Linger GmbH Heli of Frankfurt and Tesch Stabenow Testa of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east. Degesch owned 51 percent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 percent of Testa. Prior to World War II Degesch derived most of its Zyklon B profits from overseas sales, particularly in the United States, where it was produced under license by Roessler Hasslacher prior to 1931 and by American Cyanamid from 1931 to 1943. From 1929, the United States Public Health Service used Zyklon B to fumigate freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants entering the United States. Uses in Germany included delousing clothing often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains. By 1943, sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 percent of Degesch's sales revenue and 70 percent of its gross profits. In early 1942, the Nazis began using Zyklon B as the preferred killing tool in extermination camps during the Holocaust. They used it to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers at Auschwitz Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most of the victims were Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Distributor Heli supplied Zyklon B to Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald, and Testa supplied it to Auschwitz and Majdanek camps also occasionally bought it directly from the manufacturers. Some 56 tonnes of the 729 tonnes sold in Germany in 194244 were sold to concentration camps, amounting to about 8 percent of domestic sales. Auschwitz received 23.8 tonnes, of which 6 tonnes were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage the product had a stated shelf life of only three months . Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, which meant they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight. Rudolf Hoss, commandant of Auschwitz, said that the use of Zyklon B to kill prisoners came about on the initiative of one of his subordinates, SS Hauptsturmfuhrer captain Karl Fritzsch, who had used it to kill some Russian POWs in late August 1941 in the basement of Block 11 in the main camp. They repeated the experiment on more Russian POWs in September, with Hoss watching. Block 11 proved unsuitable for mass killings, as the basement was difficult to air out afterwards and the crematorium Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942 was some distance away. The site of the killings was moved to Crematorium I, where more than 700 victims could be killed at once. By the middle of 1942, the operation was moved to Auschwitz IIBirkenau, a nearby satellite camp which had been under construction since October 1941. The first gas chamber at Auschwitz IIBirkenau was the red house called Bunker 1 by SS staff , a brick cottage converted to a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows. It was operational by March 1942. A second brick cottage, called the white house or Bunker 2, was converted some weeks later. According to Hoss, Bunker 1 held 800 victims and Bunker 2 held 1,200 victims. These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943. At that point, the Nazis decided to greatly increase the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II was originally designed as a mortuary with morgues in the basement and ground level incinerators they converted it into a killing factory by installing gas tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas afterwards. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the beginning as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures. The Nazis began shipping large numbers of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz in the middle of 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. Those selected to die generally comprised about three quarters of the total and included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told that they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber. A special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute delivered the Zyklon B to the crematoria by ambulance. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Johann Kremer, an SS doctor who oversaw gassings, testified that the shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives . Sonderkommandos special work crews forced to work at the gas chambers wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, artificial limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some foaming at the mouth or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease throughout the Reich. After World War II ended in 1945, Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher of Tesch Stabenow were tried in a British military court and executed for knowingly providing Zyklon B to the SS for use on humans. Gerhard Peters, who served as principal operating officer of Degesch and Heli and also held posts in the Nazi government, served two years eight months in prison as an accessory before being released due to amendments to the penal code. Use of hydrogen cyanide as a pesticide or cleaner has been banned or restricted in some countries. Most hydrogen cyanide is used in industrial processes, made by companies in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the US. Degesch resumed production of Zyklon B after the war. The product was sold as Cyanosil in Germany and Zyklon in other countries. It was still produced as of 2008. Degussa sold Degesch to Detia Freyberg GmbH in 1986. The company is now called Detia Degesch. Up until around 2015, a fumigation product similar to Zyklon B was in production by Lucebni zavody Draslovka of the Czech Republic, under the trade name Uragan D2. Uragan means hurricane or cyclone in Czech. Subsequent use of the word Zyklon in trade names has prompted angry reactions in English speaking countries. The name Zyklon on portable roller coasters made since 1965 by Pinfari provoked protests among Jewish groups in the U.S. in 1993, and 1999. In 2002, British sportswear and football equipment supplier Umbro issued an apology and stopped using the name Zyklon , which had appeared since 1999 on the box for one of its trainers, after receiving complaints from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre. Also in 2002, Siemens withdrew its application for an American trademark of the word Zyklon , which their subsidiary BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgerate had proposed to use for a new line of home appliances in the United States.

A rabbi said the name was horrible ignorance at best, and a Guinness record in evil and cynicism if the company did know the history of the name of its product. Holocaust deniers claim that Zyklon B gas was not used in the gas chambers, relying for evidence on the discredited research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that had been exposed to the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Krakow re examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers as positive controls and living quarters as negative controls . They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters. Green, Richard J. McCarthy, Jamie.

"The Zytglogge Bernese German is a landmark medieval tower in Bern, Switzerland. Built in the early 13th century, it has served the city as guard tower, prison, clock tower, centre of urban life and civic memorial. Despite the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800 years of existence, the Zytglogge is one of Bern's most recognisable symbols and the oldest monument of the city, and with its 15th century astronomical clock, a major tourist attraction. It is a heritage site of national significance, and part of the Old City of Bern, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. When it was built around 121820, the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern's western fortifications. These were erected after the city's first westward expansion following its de facto independence from the Empire. At that time, the Zytglogge was a squat building of only 16 metres 52 ft in height. When the rapid growth of the city and the further expansion of the fortifications up to the Kafigturm relegated the tower to second line status at around 127075, it was heightened by 7 metres 23 ft to overlook the surrounding houses. Only after the city's western defences were extended again in 134446 up to the now destroyed Christoffelturm, the Zytglogge was converted to a women's prison, notably housing Pfaffendirnen priests' whores , women convicted of sexual relations with clerics. At this time, the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof. In the great fire of 1405, the tower burnt out completely. It suffered severe structural damage that required thorough repairs, which were not complete until after the last restoration in 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was first installed above the gate in the early 15th century, probably including a simple astronomical clock and musical mechanism. This clock, together with the great bell cast in 1405, gave the Zytglogge its name, which in Bernese German means time bell . In the late 15th century, the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern including the metal bellman visible today , four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 152730, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery. The Zytglogge's exterior was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 160710, who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west facades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 177071, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline. Both facades were again repainted in the Rococo style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890. The idealising historicism of the design came to be disliked in the 20th century, and a 1929 competition produced the facade designs visible today on the west facade, Victor Surbek's fresco Beginning of Time and on the east facade, a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt Indermuhle. In 198183, the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance. In the advent season and from Easter until the end of October, it is illuminated after dusk. The Bernese German Zytglogge translates to Zeitglocke in Standard German and to time bell in English 'Glocke' is German for 'bell', as in the related term 'glockenspiel'. A time bell was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour. Such a device was installed in the Wendelstein in Bern the tower of the Leutkirche church which the Munster later replaced in 1383 at the latest it alerted the bell ringer to ring the tower bells. The name of Zytglogge was first recorded in 1413. Previously, the tower was referred to as the kebie cage , i.e., prison and after its post 1405 reconstruction, the nuwer turm new tower . The Zytglogge has an overall height of 54.5 metres 179 ft , and a height of 24 metres 79 ft up to the roof edge. Its rectangular floor plan measures 11.2 by 10.75 metres 36.7 by 35.3 ft . The wall strengths vary widely, ranging from 260 centimetres 100 in in the west, where the tower formed part of the city walls, to 65 centimetres 26 in in the east. The outward appearance of the Zytglogge is determined by the 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history. The main body of the tower is divided into the two storey plinth, whose exterior is made of alpine limestone, and the three storey tower shaft sheathed in sandstone. The shaft's seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks. Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two story attic is covered by the sweeping, red tiled, late Gothic spire, in which two spire lights are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th century drawings. From atop the spire, the wooden pinnacle, copper sheathed since 1930, rises an additional 15 metres 49 ft into the skies, crowned with a gilded knob and a weather vane displaying a cut out coat of arms of Bern. The tower's two namesake bronze bells hang in the cupola at its very top. The great hour bell, cast by Johann Reber, has remained unchanged since the tower's reconstruction in 1405. It has a diameter of 127 centimetres 50 in , a weight of 1,400 kilograms 3,100 lb and rings with a nominal tone of e'. The inscription on the bell reads, in Latin In the October month of the year 1405 I was cast by Master John called Reber of Aarau. I am vessel and wax, and to all I tell the hours of the day. When the great bell rings out every full hour, struck by a large clockwork operated hammer, passers by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger than life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek personification of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nurnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770. Below the hour bell hangs the smaller quarter hour bell, also rung by a clockwork hammer. It was cast in 1887 to replace the cracked 1486 original. Both principal facades, East and West, are dominated by massive clockfaces. The Zytglogge's first clockface was likely located on the plinth, but was moved up to the center of the shaft during the tower's 15th century reconfiguration. The eastern clock face features an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals, on which the larger hand indicates the hour, and an inner ring on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes. The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zahringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current post 1983 layout is generally that of 1770. The western clock face has similar hands, but is an integral part of Victor Surbek's 1929 fresco Beginning of Time . The painting depicts Chronos swooping down with cape fluttering, and, below the clockface, Adam and Eve's eviction from Paradise by an angel. The dial of the Zytglogge's astronomical clock is built in the form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically projected planisphere divided into three zones the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year. Around the planisphere moves the rete, a web like metal cutout representing the zodiac, which also features a Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates the day of the week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the rete's calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset. The painted frieze above the astronomical clock shows five deities from classical antiquity, each representing both a day of the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint. The clock dial has been dated to either the building phases of 1405 or 1467 83, or to the installation of the Brunner clockwork in 1527 30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th century astronomical clocks all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467 83 renovations. A clock is documented in this tower since 1405, when a new bell was installed. The Zytglogge's internal layout has changed over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth century guard tower was not much more than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted. The rooms above the clockwork mechanism were used by the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance and in the course of regular guided tours.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zytglogge
