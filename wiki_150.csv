"WrestleMania sequentially known as WrestleMania I was the inaugural WrestleMania and inaugural professional wrestling pay per view PPV event only in selected areas , produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . It took place on March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The attendance for the event was 19,121. The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed circuit television, making it the largest pay per view showing of a wrestling event on closed circuit television in the United States at the time. The show consisted of nine professional wrestling matches. In the main event, Hulk Hogan and Mr. T defeated Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper. Also, Wendi Richter accompanied by manager Cyndi Lauper defeated Leilani Kai to win the WWF Women's Championship, and Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik defeated The U.S. Express Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Celebrity guests included former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali as referee, baseball player manager Billy Martin as ring announcer, and musician actor Liberace as timekeeper. The attendance at the event was 19,121. In addition, the event was seen by over one million viewers through closed circuit television, making it the largest wrestling event on closed circuit television in the United States at the time. A technical glitch ended the closed circuit broadcast early into the showing at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To appease angry fans who pelted the screen with garbage, WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on local ABC affiliate WTAE TV two weeks later. WWF announcer Gene Okerlund sang the national anthem, and Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura performed on commentary. Okerlund also did interviews backstage, and Alfred Hayes did interviews near the entrance to the locker room, right outside the ring. Howard Finkel was the ring announcer. The opening theme for the event was the instrumental portion of the Phil Collins and Philip Bailey hit Easy Lover , while the closing theme for the credits was Axel F by Harold Faltermeyer. Celebrity guests in attendance included Billy Martin, Cyndi Lauper, Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Liberace accompanied by The Rockettes. During the 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation WWF 's main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade annual events, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. For the first WrestleMania, Vince McMahon began cross promoting with MTV, which aired two wrestling specials. The first one was The Brawl to End It All, aired on July 23, 1984, in which a match from a live Madison Square Garden broadcast was shown on MTV. Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the WWF Women's Championship on the card, with Cyndi Lauper on her side. At The War to Settle the Score, which aired on February 18, 1985, Leilani Kai, accompanied by Moolah, defeated Richter, again accompanied by Lauper, to win the Women's Championship. Aside from Lauper, other celebrities also appeared during the buildup to and at the event most notably Muhammad Ali, Liberace with The Rockettes and Major League Baseball manager Billy Martin all appeared during the main event. The card consisted of nine matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWF's writers. Three championships were defended at WrestleMania the WWF Women's Championship, WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Prior to the event, Greg Valentine had feuded with Tito Santana over the Intercontinental belt. Valentine defeated Santana on September 24, 1984 for the championship. Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham won the WWF Tag Team Championship three months before WrestleMania from the team of Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch. In the months leading up to the first WrestleMania, Rowdy Roddy Piper began a talk show segment on WWF television entitled Piper's Pit . On one episode of the show, he hit Jimmy Snuka over the head with a coconut, leading to a feud between the two men. As part of the storyline, Piper recruited Bob Orton to be his bodyguard. On another episode of Piper's Pit, Piper spoke out against the burgeoning Rock 'n' Wrestling connection, which led to a confrontation with Hulk Hogan. In February 1985, the two men faced each other at The War to Settle the Score, where Hogan won by disqualification after interference by Paul Orndorff and Mr. T. Their on going feud led to their match at WrestleMania. As part of the promotion for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock a move that cuts off the flow of blood to the brain. Belzer, however, fell to the floor unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for 5 million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event. Gene Okerlund opened the event by singing the national anthem. The originally intended singer, a celebrity guest that Okerlund and Vince McMahon refused to name, failed to appear. The first match was between Tito Santana and The Executioner Buddy Rose . Santana won the match after applying a figure four leglock on The Executioner. Following the match, King Kong Bundy accompanied by Jimmy Hart and Special Delivery Jones made their way to the ring. After crushing his opponent against the turnbuckle and landing on him stomach first, Bundy pinned Jones. The WWF's official time for the match is a then record time of nine seconds a record since surpassed by The Rock defeating Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32 , although the match actually lasted 17 seconds. The next match was between Ricky Steamboat and Matt Borne. Steamboat took the early advantage in the match up, until Borne flipped him over and slammed him to the mat using a belly to belly suplex. After performing a flying crossbody Steamboat pinned Borne for the win. After the match ended, David Sammartino, accompanied by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, made their way to the ring. The action favoured both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no contest. The first championship defense of WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied to the ring by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with his feet on the ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count out as Valentine failed to re enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count out. The following match was for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik, accompanied to the ring by Freddie Blassie, challenged the reigning champions, The U.S. Express Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham , who were accompanied by Lou Albano. The U.S. Express dominated the early part of the match until Volkoff and The Sheik began to gain the offensive advantage over Rotundo. Rotundo then tagged in Windham, who performed a bulldog on The Sheik. After nearly being pinned, The Sheik hit Windham in the head with Blassie's cane as the referee had his back turned. After Volkoff got the pin, Volkoff and The Sheik were crowned as the new tag champions. The next match on the card was a 15,000 Body Slam Challenge between Andre the Giant and Big John Studd, who was accompanied by Bobby Heenan. The stipulation of the match was that Andre the Giant had to body slam Studd to win 15,000, and if he failed, he would be forced to retire. After beginning the match in the defensive position, Andre countered with chops and a headbutt. From then on Andre controlled the match and after weakening Studd's knees with multiple kicks, Andre was able to lift Studd over his shoulders and execute a body slam to win the match. After Andre collected his prize money, he started throwing the money out to the audience. Heenan, however, grabbed the bag holding the remainder of the winnings and ran from ringside. As a result of the match, Andre was able to continue his career and his WWF undefeated streak was unscathed. After all the men had left ringside, it was time for the WWF Women's Championship match between Wendi Richter, managed by singer Cyndi Lauper , and Leilani Kai, managed by former champion The Fabulous Moolah. Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she was outside on the floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai's momentum to roll up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women's Champion. The main event and last match of the night pitted Hulk Hogan, the reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion, and Mr. T, accompanied by Jimmy Snuka, against Rowdy Roddy Piper and Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff, accompanied by Cowboy Bob Orton. Professional boxer Muhammad Ali was the special guest referee on the outside of the ring , New York Yankees manager Billy Martin was the guest ring announcer while Liberace accompanied by The Rockettes was the guest time keeper. First, Piper, Orndorff, and Orton made their way to the ring as drums and bagpipes played, causing the crowd to boo. Crowd favorites Hogan, Mr. T, and Snuka made their way to the ring next. The match began with Mr. T and Piper in the ring and the two traded blows. Midway through the match, all four men began brawling in the ring, and Muhammad Ali punched Piper in an attempt to restore order. After the match's order was restored, Orndorff and Piper had the offensive advantage. As Orndorff locked Hogan into a full nelson, Orton climbed the top rope to attempt to knock out Hogan. Instead, Orton mistakenly hit Orndorff, and Hogan pinned him to win the match. In frustration, Piper knocked out the in ring official, Pat Patterson before he and Orton retreated backstage leaving Orndorff alone in the ring with Hogan, Mr. T, and Snuka. Approximately three months after WrestleMania, on July 6, 1985, Greg Valentine lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Tito Santana in a cage match. At about the same time, Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik lost the WWF Tag Team Championship back to The U.S. Express. They held the title until August, when the team of Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine, later known as the Dream Team, became the new champions. On July 8, 1985, Don Muraco won the inaugural King of The Ring tournament by defeating the Iron Sheik in the finals. After Andre the Giant defeated Big John Studd at the event, Studd formed a tag team with King Kong Bundy, and the duo faced Andre and Hulk Hogan on a number of occasions. Later, the team of Studd and Bundy teamed up in Handicap matchesa two against one wrestling matchagainst Andre, which renewed the feud between Andre and Studd. In late 1985, Wendi Richter lost her WWF Women's Championship in controversial fashion. She wrestled a masked female wrestler known as The Spider Lady, who pinned Richter to win the title. After the match, the Spider Lady was revealed as the Fabulous Moolah. This finish was a screwjob, i.e. one participant in this case Richter was unaware of the planned title change. Richter left the WWF shortly after, and Moolah held the title for approximately two years. In a new storyline after WrestleMania, Roddy Piper began training Bob Orton as a boxer. Hulk Hogan accepted a challenge on the behalf of Mr. T to face Orton in a match on the February 15, 1986 Saturday Night's Main Event V. After Mr. T won the match, Orton and Piper attacked him, leading to a boxing match at WrestleMania 2 between Piper and Mr. T. At the second annual WrestleMania, Piper was disqualified in the Fourth round. John Powell of Slam Wrestling rated the event as average, citing that it wasn't the greatest... . Despite his overall rating, he praised several moments, including Orton hitting Orndorff with his cast, King Kong Bundy's win, and Andre the Giant throwing the money into the crowd. Powell, however, listed Mr. T wrestling as his least favorite moment of the pay per view. He claimed the main event match, in which Mr. T took part, was humorous despite its lack of technical wrestling. In contrast, Pro Wrestling Illustrated awarded the main event match its annual PWI Match of the Year honor. The event was also included in a July 2007 special that aired on the MSG Network titled The 50 Greatest Moments at Madison Square Garden , ranking at 30. In the December 2002 issue of Wrestling Digest, the main event match up was listed as number five in the most memorable twenty five matches of the past twenty five years. Echoing John Powell's thoughts, Kevin Eck of Wrestling Digest stated, The match itself was far from a technical wrestling classic, but it delivered in terms of entertaining the crowd. In another Wrestling Digest article, written by Keith Loria, the main event was ranked third in the top ten matches in WrestleMania history. In contrast to Powell, Loria believed that Mr. T proved to be an adequate grappler .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20I
"WrestleMania 2 was the second annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . The event took place on Monday, April 7, 1986, making it the only WrestleMania that was not held on the traditional Sunday.

The card featured 12 matches, which resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by the WWF. Building to the event, storylines between characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, Championship Wrestling, All Star Wrestling, Saturday Night's Main Event and Prime Time Wrestling. Three of the main event feuds were set up on the March 1, 1986, Saturday Night's Main Event V. The main feud heading into WrestleMania 2 was between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy, with the two battling over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although they had wrestled occasionally before, their first nationally televised encounter was on the November 2, 1985, Saturday Night's Main Event III where Hogan teamed up with Andre the Giant against Andre's rivals Bundy and Big John Studd. Hogan and Andre won the match. On March 1, Hogan defended his WWF title against The Magnificent Muraco. Just as Hogan was about to pin Muraco, Bundy ran into the ring andwith Muraco's helpinitiated a 2 on 1 assault on Hogan, repeatedly crushing him with his body weight with a move called the Avalanche to break his ribs. Hogan had a very serious scripted injury, while Bundy gloating over his actions challenged Hogan for the title. With revenge on his mind, Hogan decided not to heed his doctor's advice and accepted the challenge a match was then booked between the two in a steel cage for the WWF title. The second feud heading into the event was between Mr. T and Rowdy Roddy Piper. Piper established himself as the top heel in the WWF in 1984. A year later he joined Paul Orndorff and Bob Orton to feud with Hulk Hogan and Mr. T who defeated them in the main event of the first ever WrestleMania. The Piper Mr. T feud restarted in 1986 after their real life hatred for each other became known, prompting the WWF to turn their animosity for one another into a feud. Piper and others disliked Mr. T because he was an actor and had no wrestling skills. In response, Mr. T became a special WWF boxer and began competing in boxing matches. On the March 1 Saturday Night's Main Event V, Mr. T defeated Orton in a boxing match. After the match, Piper distracted Mr. T, allowing Orton to attack from behind and start a 2 on 1 assault. Mr. T then demanded revenge, leading to his boxing match against Piper. The third main feud heading into WrestleMania was between The Dream Team Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake and The British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid over the WWF Tag Team Championship. On August 24, 1985, Beefcake and Valentine won the tag titles from The U.S. Express Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo . The British Bulldogs challenged Beefcake and Valentine for their titles immediately after their win. They retained their titles against the Bulldogs at a house show on September 11 by getting disqualified. They again defended the titles against the Bulldogs Saturday Night's Main Event V, where they emerged victorious against them. After the Bulldogs twice failed to win the titles, Dream Team agreed to defend their titles against them for a final time with a title match set at WrestleMania. The other major feud heading into WrestleMania 2 was Randy Macho Man Savage and George the Animal Steele. Its genesis came after Steele, who used a Neanderthal, missing link type gimmick, became smitten with Savage's manager, the beautiful Miss Elizabeth Savage's real life wife, although unacknowledged on television . Their first meeting took place on a Saturday Night's Main Event IV aired shortly before Savage won the Intercontinental Championship. Steele would frequently be distracted by Elizabeth, which Savage used to his advantage. Along with former champion Tito Santana who was on the Los Angeles segment of the event Steele became one of Savage's top challengers for the title. WrestleMania 2 emanated from three arenas Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, the Rosemont Horizon in Rosemont, Illinois and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles. In the first match of the show in the New York arena, Paul Orndorff faced The Magnificent Muraco. In the early part of the match, Orndorff body slams Muraco. As the crowd reacts and Orndorff celebrates, he turns towards Mr. Fuji and makes a racist slanty eyed gesture followed by an Italian salute. This controversial moment is edited out of most home video versions of the match and is edited out of the version shown on the WWE Network. Both men fought to a double countout. Next was a WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between Macho Man Randy Savage and George The Animal Steele, where Savage was seconded by his real life wife Miss Elizabeth. Late in the match, Steele became the first man to ever kick out of Savage's signature elbow from the top turnbuckle. Savage pinned Steele with a roll up and put both of his feet on the ropes for leverage. As a result, Savage retained the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. The third match from the Coliseum was between Jake Roberts and George Wells. Roberts hit a DDT on Wells and pinned him to win the match. After the match, Roberts allowed his snake Damian to slither over Wells, who foamed from the mouth. The last match was a boxing match between Mr. T and Rowdy Roddy Piper. T was seconded by boxer Joe Frazier while Piper was seconded by boxing trainer Lou Duva. Piper was disqualified for bodyslamming T at 1 15 in the fourth round. The first match from the Chicago portion of WrestleMania 2 was a WWF Women's Championship match between The Fabulous Moolah and Velvet McIntyre. McIntyre attempted a splash on Moolah from the second turnbuckle, but Moolah sidestepped and McIntyre missed the move. Moolah took advantage and pinned McIntyre to retain her title. The second match was a flag match between Corporal Kirchner and Nikolai Volkoff. Freddie Blassie seconded Volkoff. He threw his cane to Volkoff, but Kirchner caught it and hit Volkoff with it and then successfully pinned him for the victory. The third match was a 20 man battle royal involving WWF wrestlers and National Football League players including Jimbo Covert, Bill Fralic, Russ Francis, Ernie Holmes, Harvey Martin and William The Refrigerator Perry. The WWF stars included Andre the Giant, Ted Arcidi, Tony Atlas, The Hart Foundation Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart , The Killer Bees B. Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell , Hillbilly Jim, The Iron Sheik, King Tonga, Pedro Morales, Bruno Sammartino, Danny Spivey and Big John Studd. In the end of the match, Andre the Giant and both members of the Hart Foundation were the final three participants. Andre first eliminated Neidhart and then Hart to win the battle royal. The last match was a WWF Tag Team Championship match between The British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid and The Dream Team Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake . Ex Black Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne and Lou Albano seconded the Bulldogs. Smith pushed Valentine into the corner where Valentine knocked heads with Dynamite Kid. Kid fell to the floor while Smith pinned Valentine to win the tag titles and end Dream Team's seven month reign. In Los Angeles, there were four more matches. Ricky Steamboat faced Hercules in the first match. Hercules tried to hit a flying bodypress but missed it. Steamboat followed by hitting a flying bodypress of his own for a successful pinfall victory. Adrian Adonis, seconded by Jimmy Hart, defeated Uncle Elmer after a diving headbutt. The Funk Brothers faced Junkyard Dog and Tito Santana in a tag team match. Jimmy Hart accompanied the Funk brothers. Hoss Funk distracted the referee. Hart took advantage and gave his megaphone to Terry Funk, who hit Junkyard Dog and then pinned him to get the win. Finally, the main event of WrestleMania 2 a WWF World Heavyweight Championship steel cage match in which Hulk Hogan defended his title against King Kong Bundy. Hogan's ribs were heavily taped due to an assault by Bundy on the March 1, 1986, edition of Saturday Night's Main Event V where Bobby Heenan seconded Bundy. At the start, Bundy removed the tape from Hogan's ribs. However, Hogan fought back and rammed Bundy's head into the steel cage. He tried to hit a scoop slam on Bundy but missed it. Bundy hit an avalanche and a big splash on Hogan. However, Hogan Hulked up and hit a power slam on Bundy followed by a leg drop. He climbed the steel cage, but Bundy caught his legs. Hogan kicked Bundy and climbed over the top of the steel cage and down to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Hogan caught Heenan inside the cage as Bundy was reeling from the match, Hogan rammed Heenan's head into the cage before atomic dropping him outside. Macho Man Randy Savage and George The Animal Steele continued their feud with each other throughout 1986. This led to two rematches for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on Saturday Night's Main Event IX in early 1987, both times with the Intercontinental title on the line and the second time with the management services of Elizabeth on the line Steele lost both times. Savage also feuded intensely with Hogan, but was unsuccessful in winning the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from him. The new WWF Tag Team Champions The British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid prepared to face challenging tag teams. On the October 4, 1986, Saturday Night's Main Event VII, they defeated former champions Dream Team Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake in a two out of three falls match to retain the titles. Hulk Hogan continued his WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign. In addition to Savage, his top competition during 1986 included Adorable Adrian Adonis, Hercules Hernandez and, in his biggest feud of the year, Paul Orndorff. A storyline was developed focusing on the friendship between Hogan and Orndorff with Adrian Adonis eventually starting trouble between the two causing Orndorff to turn against Hogan. Bundy, meanwhile, would team with Big John Studd on occasion and begin his feud with The Machines . He would also challenge Hogan on and off for the World Heavyweight Championship during the next year and a half, until leaving the WWF in early 1988. Following his battle royal win, Andre the Giant's career was at a crossroads. Not yet evident to fans, he was beginning to suffer the health effects of his terminal illness known as acromegaly, a syndrome resulting from an excessive production of growth hormone that led to his gigantic size. Because of his health, a planned tour of Japan and accepting a starring role in the movie The Princess Bride, Andre took a brief hiatus from the ring. To explain his absence, a storyline was devised to have Andre no show for a tag team match pitting him and a partner of his choosing against long time rivals Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. Andre would then be suspended at the insistence of manager Bobby Heenan. Andre would return but compete under a mask as part of a new team called The Machines. Studd and Bundy insistedbut were never able to provethat Andre and The Giant Machine were the same person. WrestleMania 2 marked the last major pay per view appearance for Roddy Piper during his initial heel run. Shortly before the event, he taped four weeks worth of Piper's Pit segments that would air on the WWF's syndicated programs in April, and then took a four month hiatus from the ring. When Piper returned to the WWF in August, he became a face and began a violent feud with Adonis, who had in the meantime started his own Piper's Pit type talk show called The Flower Shop. Jesse the Body Ventura also took a leave of absence after WrestleMania 2 like Piper, he filmed several weeks worth of his talk show segment, The Body Shop, to air in the coming weeks. Afterward, The Magnificent Muraco would be the fill in host of the segment until the final installment, aired August 30, 1986. In late August, Ventura returned for television tapings of the first WWF Superstars of Wrestling, continuing his role as a heel favoring color commentator. Critical response to the show was poor, with the decision to host the show in three different locations being highly criticized. John Canton, of TJR Retro website said I'm sure that the idea of doing this show from three different venues sounded like a good idea on paper to Vince McMahon, but it was not effective in terms of producing a quality program. Voices of Wrestling's Bryan Rose commented that he could see why WWE went with just one arena from this point forward . Jason Powell of prowrestling.net was also happy to learn that subsequent WrestleManias would not be held in three separate arenas, saying Overall, WrestleMania 2 was excessive. The idea of running the show in three separate markets was an ill conceived cash grab and I'm happy they never went down that road again. Rob McNew of 411mania John Canton, of TJR Retro was also very critical of the show's promoted main events. He commented that every one of the big matches on the show was a disappointment from the Hogan Bundy cage match, the battle royal and the Piper Mr. T boxing match. If the big matches are that poor it hurts the whole show. 411Mania.com's Rob McNew also had a negative opinion of the three main matches. McNew gave the boxing match 1 star out of 5 stars, saying Big pull apart brawl afterward. Absolute crap that took way too long and ended in a non finish. He gave the steel cage match between Hogan and Bundy 2 stars, saying it felt more like a Saturday Night Main Event match than a WrestleMania main event . McNew awarded the entire event a score of 2 out of 10 and said It lacks the historical significance of WrestleMania I to even watch it for that purpose. This was three hours of pain I'd love to have back. Thankfully the WWF would redeem themselves in a huge way the next year, but for this show, huge disappointment. However, of the WWF Tag Team Championship match, McNew said Tremendous match that breaks the streak of suck that had been this show thus far. One of the things that I really liked about this match was it seemed to break from the traditional tag team formula. There was no extended face in peril sequence nor was there a hot tag at any point. Easily the match of the night. He awarded it three and a half stars out of five. Despite general poor reviews for WrestleMania 2, Brandon Stroud from Uproxx, called the event superior to WrestleMania I, commenting WrestleMania 2 is believe it or not a gigantic improvement over WrestleMania I... It's not the best show everit's nowhere near as important as III, and we wouldn't get a great in total WrestleMania until Xbut it's the kind of thing that kicks your ass when you're a kid, and that's important.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%202
"WrestleMania III was the third annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . The event was held on March 29, 1987, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. There were twelve matches, with the main event featuring WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan successfully defending his title against Andre the Giant. WrestleMania III is particularly notable due to the WWF record attendance of 93,173 and the largest recorded attendance of a live indoor event in North America at the time. The event is considered to be the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom, with almost one million fans watching the event at 160 closed circuit locations in North America and the number of people watching via pay per view estimated at several million. The WWF generated 1.6 million in ticket sales, and pay per view revenues were estimated at 10.3 million, setting a record for the time. The only WWF E event with an official higher attendance was WrestleMania 32, held at AT T Stadium in 2016. The record for the largest indoor event stood until January 27, 1999, when it was surpassed by the papal mass with Pope John Paul II at the TWA Dome in St. Louis, MO, which drew an audience of 104,000 people. Like all other WrestleMania events, WrestleMania III was promoted for several months in advance. The main feud stemmed from Andre the Giant's heel turn and betrayal of his friend, the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, which began on an episode of Piper's Pit when WWF President Jack Tunney presented Hogan with a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years, and Andre, his good friend, came out to congratulate him but cryptically remarked Three years to be a champion, it's a long time . A week later on another episode of Piper's Pit, Tunney presented Andre with a visibly smaller trophy for being undefeated in the WWF for 15 years and Hogan came out to congratulate Andre, but before The Giant could speak, Hogan ended up being the focal point of the interview. Annoyed by this, Andre walked out during Hogan's congratulation speech. A week later on yet another Piper's Pit segment, Jesse Ventura hinted he knew something about Andre but wasnt telling. This infuriated Piper and the two nearly came to blows before Jesse challenged that he could produce Andre next week, asking Piper can you produce Hogan Piper agreed and nervously asked Hogan later on who agreed. The following week Hogan was on Pipers Pit first when Andre walked out with Bobby The Brain Heenan, a long time adversary of Hogan and Andre, He announced himself to be Andre's new manager. Andre then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III and attacked Hogan, ripping off Hogan's T shirt and crucifix necklace. Another main feud leading up to the event was between Ricky The Dragon Steamboat and the Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Macho Man Randy Savage. The feud began during a title match between the two when Savage attacked Steamboat as he greeted fans at ringside. Savage then pushed Steamboat over the security rail and delivered an elbow shot that thrust Steamboat's throat into the rail and dropped the ring bell onto his throat from the top rope, injuring his larynx and sending him to the hospital. This resulted in a long, bitter feud that lasted for six months, included several bloody match ups and finally culminated at WrestleMania. George The Animal Steele was in Steamboat's corner, having developed a crush on Savage's valet, Miss Elizabeth. Billy Jack Haynes and Hercules' feud started when Bobby Heenan continuously taunted Haynes, telling him that Hercules was the real master of Haynes' finishing move, the full nelson which came to a boiling point when Hercules attacked Haynes on an edition of Superstars of Wrestling, which led to their match at WrestleMania. This battle was advertised as the Full Nelson Challenge. Another heated feud leading up to this event was between The King Harley Race and the Junkyard Dog. When The WWF Wrestling Classic became the King of the Ring tournament, Harley Race went on to win the tournament and began referring to himself as King Harley Race, and coming to the ring in a royal crown and cape to the ceremonial accompaniment of the classical music piece Great Gates of Kiev by Modest Mussorgsky. After each of his victories, Race forced his defeated opponent to bow and kneel before him. Usually, Race's manager, Bobby Heenan, forced the defeated opponent to bow and kneel by grabbing his hair. Junkyard Dog protested Race's self proclaimed monarchy in the WWF and stated there would never be a complete ruler in the WWF, which led to a match on Saturday Night's Main Event IX, in which the King and his manager both tried to make Junkyard Dog bow for them. This set the stage for the WrestleMania match, which included the stipulation that the loser had to bow to the winner. On January 26, 1987, The British Bulldogs lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to The Hart Foundation in a match that saw the Dynamite Kid so debilitated with a back injury that he was virtually carried to the ring by Davey Boy Smith and did not see any physical action after being knocked out by the Hart's manager The Mouth of the South Jimmy Hart who had hit him with his megaphone as the match began. Danny Davis was the referee and allowed The Hart Foundation to use illegal double team maneuvers. After being given some time off for Dynamite to recuperate, the Bulldogs continued their rivalry with The Hart Foundation when they teamed up with Tito Santana against the Foundation and the referee turned wrestler Danny Davis in a six man tag team match at WrestleMania III. The match was billed as a revenge match with Santana's inclusion due to Davis being the referee in the Boston Garden in early 1986 when he had lost the Intercontinental title to the Macho Man who used a foreign object to get the win. Rock singer and Detroit native Alice Cooper was in Jake The Snake Roberts' corner during his match with The Honky Tonk Man managed by Colonel Jimmy Hart. The Honky Tonk Man had attacked Roberts with a guitar on Roberts' interview segment The Snake Pit, which legitimately injured Roberts' neck. This event began Roberts' turn into a babyface as well as the feud between the wrestlers, which culminated in their WrestleMania match. The feud between Adorable Adrian Adonis and Rowdy Roddy Piper began when, following a leave of absence from the WWF in mid 1986, Piper returned to find his Piper's Pit segment replaced by The Flower Shop, a segment hosted by then effeminate wrestler Adrian Adonis. Piper, who returned as a face, spent weeks crashing Adonis' show and trading insults, leading to a showdown between the two segments that ended with Piper being assaulted and humiliated by Adonis, Piper's former bodyguard Bob Orton, and Don Muraco. The trio left Piper with his face covered in red lipstick, lying in the middle of the remnants of the destroyed Piper's Pit set. In response, Piper stormed the set of Adonis' show and destroyed it with a baseball bat. This led to their Hair vs. Hair match at WrestleMania III, which was billed as Piper's retirement match from wrestling before becoming a full time actor. WWF owner Vince McMahon claims that as he was about to announce Welcome to WrestleMania III, he felt the spirit of his father Vincent J. McMahon, who had died three years earlier. After McMahon welcomed the audience, he introduced Aretha Franklin, who opened the show singing a rendition of America the Beautiful. The first match of the night was The Can Am Connection Rick Martel and Tom Zenk versus Bob Orton Jr. and The Magnificent Muraco with Mr. Fuji . This match ended when Martel gave Muraco a high cross body with Zenk on his hands and knees giving Muraco what Gorilla Monsoon called A little schoolboy trip from behind allowing Martel to get the win for his team. The next match that aired was Hercules with Bobby The Brain Heenan in his corner against Billy Jack Haynes in the Full Nelson Challenge. The match ended when Haynes locked Hercules in the full nelson outside the ring and both were counted out. After the match, Heenan assaulted Haynes by kneeing him in the back after Haynes had applied the full nelson to Hercules outside the ring. Haynes then chased Heenan into the ring, where Hercules then blindsided Haynes with his chain, hitting him a number of times with it before locking a bloodied Haynes into his own full nelson. The Mixed Tag Team Match between King Kong Bundy and his professional wrestling team of Lord Littlebrook and Little Tokyo against Hillbilly Jim and his own team of The Haiti Kid and Little Beaver was next. The rules were that only midgets could fight midgets and that neither Bundy nor Hillbilly was allowed to attack the midgets, though at one point Bundy tagged in and Little Beaver refused to tag out immediately, even hitting the 458 lb 208 kg Walking condominium with a drop kick to no effect before bailing with a tag to Hillbilly Jim. King Kong Bundy's team was disqualified when Bundy attacked Little Beaver, because Bundy was not supposed to be in the ring with the midgets. After Beaver had attacked Bundy on occasion during the match, he finally got caught and Bundy attacked Little Beaver, hitting him with a body slam before dropping an elbow across his chest. The Loser Must Bow match between the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race with Bobby Heenan and The Queen of Wrestling The Fabulous Moolah followed. Prior to the match Mean Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah predicted that Junkyard Dog would have to bow to the King as he is supposed to do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her to put it on the King's head after the match, As only the Queen of Wrestling can do . Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation. The next match was The Dream Team Brutus Beefcake and Greg The Hammer Valentine , with Luscious Johnny V and Canadian strong man Dino Bravo in their corner, against The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, Jacques and Raymond. Ray Rougeau started off the match by locking up with Beefcake. The two men later tagged out, and Valentine brawled with Jacques Rougeau as Bravo looked on from the outside of the ring. Raymond performed a sleeper hold on Valentine and was followed by Beefcake jumping off the ropes and accidentally hitting The Hammer with a double axe handle. The Rougeau Brothers gave Valentine a double team move, but the referee was arguing with Beefcake. The match ended when Dino Bravo jumped off the top rope and hit Raymond while he was pinning Valentine, then rolling Valentine on top of him for the win. The Dream Team argued for most of the match, which led to Valentine, Bravo and Luscious Johnny departing together, without Beefcake. Footage of an interview with Rowdy Roddy Piper was aired as Piper made his way to the ring to face Adorable Adrian Adonis, who was accompanied by The Mouth of the South Jimmy Hart, in Piper's retirement match. Piper and Adonis began the match by attacking each other with Piper's belt. Adonis put a sleeper hold on Piper in the middle of the ring and released the hold prior to Piper's arm going down for a 3rd time, thinking that he won the match. When Jimmy Hart got in the ring to celebrate with Adonis, Brutus Beefcake came to the ring to help Piper recover, and Piper attacked Adonis and performed a sleeper hold of his own. Piper got the victory, and after the match was over, Brutus got in the ring and cut Adrian Adonis' hair as Piper held Jimmy Hart down. After being woken by Beefcake and seeing himself in the mirror he had brought to the ring that Piper was holding, Adonis hit the mirror and chased Piper around the ring before leaving the ring in embarrassment with Hart using his jacket to cover Adonis' head. Up next was a six man tag team match featuring former referee Danny Davis in his debut as a WWF wrestler and the WWF Tag Team Champions, The Hart Foundation Bret Hitman Hart and Jim The Anvil Neidhart , against The British Bulldogs Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith and Tito Santana with Matilda the Bulldog in their corner. As a referee Davis' bias towards heel wrestlers had led to the Bulldogs losing the tag titles to the Harts and also led to Santana losing the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Macho Man Randy Savage. The Bulldogs had many near falls, yet Neidhart broke up most of them. After all three members of the Bulldogs Santana team had got a measure of revenge on Davis, all six wrestlers ended up brawling in the ring. Danny Davis recovered and hit Davey Boy with Jimmy Hart's megaphone and pinned him for the win. The Natural Butch Reed's making his pay per view debut against Koko B. Ware, was the following match. Reed won the match with a rollup and a handful of tights after a high cross body from Koko. After the contest, Reed's manager Slick got in the ring and attacked Koko B. Ware with his cane, but Tito Santana quickly rushed to the ring and stopped Slick, and ripped some of his clothes off. Slick retreated as Reed got back in the ring, only for Reed to get a double drop kick from Koko and Santana. The next contest was a title match involving reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Randy Macho Man Savage with Miss Elizabeth and Ricky The Dragon Steamboat with George The Animal Steele . The match itself lasted for nearly fifteen minutes At one point, Savage was about to use the ring bell as a weapon but was stopped by Steele who knocked him off of the top rope. When Savage attempted to give Steamboat a scoop slam, Steamboat reversed it into a small package to get the win and become the new WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, marking the first time in WrestleMania history that the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship changed hands. This match is considered by many to be one of the greatest matches in WWE history. The tenth match of the night was between The Honky Tonk Man with Colonel Jimmy Hart and Jake The Snake Roberts, who along with his pet Python Damien , had Detroit native Alice Cooper in his corner. When Jake went for the DDT, Honky Tonk Man's manager Jimmy Hart pulled Roberts' legs, and the Honky Tonk Man rolled up Roberts from behind, held on to the ropes, and pinned him for the win. After the match Roberts narrowly missed hitting Honky with his own guitar, smashing it against a ring post and causing Honky to run off down the aisle, leaving Hart alone in the ring. Alice Cooper got in the ring and with Roberts' holding Hart in a Full Nelson, attacked him with Roberts' python Damien. Ring announcer Howard Finkel then introduced Mean Gene Okerlund to the crowd. Okerlund then announced the indoor attendance record of 93,173. The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff with Slick were in action next, against The Killer Bees Jumping Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair . Slick asked all of the fans to rise to respect Nikolai Volkoff's singing of the Soviet National Anthem, and when Volkoff began singing, Hacksaw Jim Duggan came to the ring with his two by four, which had a tiny American flag attached to it, got on the microphone and said that Volkoff was not going to sing because America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. While the match ensued, Duggan stayed at ringside. When The Iron Sheik locked a camel clutch on Brunzell, Duggan, who was chasing Volkoff around the ring and finally into it, stopped and hit an unsuspecting Sheik across the back with his 2x4 in front of the referee, resulting in The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff winning the bout by disqualification. In what was billed as the biggest main event in sports entertainment, the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defending the title against Andre the Giant with Bobby Heenan . Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest time keeper, Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed Andre heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam Andre, but he was unable to lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, Andre gave Hogan an Irish whip to the far side of the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give Andre a clothesline to take him off his feet for the first time in the match. Hogan then Hulked up and scoop slammed the 525 lb 238 kg Giant before hitting the ropes and executing his patented leg drop pin to get the win and retain the championship. Roddy Piper went on to film Hell Comes to Frogtown and They Live and made sporadic appearances on television before finally returning to host a Piper's Pit segment at WrestleMania V. Piper continued to be active in professional wrestling at various points for more than two decades. The first televised match between Andre and Hogan after WrestleMania III was on The Main Event I on NBC on February 5, 1988, drawing a record 33 million viewers, making it the most watched match in North American professional wrestling history. The angle surrounding this match was that after winning the match, Andre ended Hogan's four year reign as WWF champion with the help of a worked screwjob finish involving twin referees Earl and Dave Hebner. Their feud culminated in a rematch at WrestleMania IV as part of a tournament to crown a new champion both ended up being disqualified during the match for using a steel chair in front of referee Joey Marella . The Hogan Andre match at WrestleMania IV was the first ever WrestleMania rematch. Randy Savage continued to challenge Ricky Steamboat for the Intercontinental title in rematches at house shows across the country. Steamboat eventually lost the title to The Honky Tonk Man, and not long after, Savage became a face and feuded with Honky Tonk over the title. On September 4th, 1987 Randy Savage won the King of The Ring by defeating King Kong Bundy. Twenty years later, WrestleMania 23 celebrated WrestleMania III by returning to the Detroit metropolitan area, showing footage from WrestleMania III, having Aretha Franklin Who's Zoomin' Who by Franklin was the theme song to WrestleMania III sing America the Beautiful, and having Kane scoop slam The Great Khali. WrestleMania 23 had the highest buyrate of any WrestleMania in history, before getting beaten by WrestleMania XXVIII. Also in 2007, WrestleMania III was re released on DVD. The DVD included pre WrestleMania interviews and matches, including the battle royal from Saturday Night's Main Event X that Hercules won, and optional pop up trivia facts about the event. WrestleMania III was re released on DVD on March 12, 2013. The event has received positive reviews. In the years after WrestleMania III, the Savage vs. Steamboat match has been ranked by critics and other wrestlers as one of the greatest matches in professional wrestling. Pro Wrestling Illustrated and Wrestling Observer Newsletter named it 1987's Match of the Year. IGN ranked it at number 6 in their Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History. Steamboat described the match as the moment in time that defined me as a wrestler. Thomas Golianopoulos of Complex Sports ranked it at number two in his list of the 50 Greatest Matches in WrestleMania History, citing that Both guys worked lightning fast and everything from Steamboat's aggressiveness to the involvement of George The Animal Steele played off their part. David Otunga picked it as WWE.com's Five Star Match of the Week in December 19, 2012. Incidentally, the Hogan vs. Andre match received a negative four star rating from Dave Meltzer and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter named it the Worst Worked Match of the Year. There have been numerous claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173 which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. This is based on claims by Dave Meltzer upon receiving information from the events promoter Zane Bresloff, and that wrestling promoters including Vince McMahon were known to regularly inflate attendance figures to make things look better. While the WWE and Silverdome management have always maintained that the 93,173 figure is correct, debate continues among wrestling fans as to what the true attendance was on the day. Also, Meltzer claimed that the 1992 SummerSlam at Wembley did 79,127, more than WrestleMania III. The record would be decisively broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016. Officially WrestleMania III ranks as the second highest attended event in WWE history behind WrestleMania 32 at the AT T Stadium in Arlington, Texas in 2016 with an alleged over 101,000 in attendance, although Meltzer claims the actual number was between 93 94,000. In 2014, Mad Magazine published an article about WrestleMania's 29 year history which made joking reference to the disputed claims When the immortal Hulk Hogan become the first man ever to bodyslam the 7 foot 4, 520 pound Andre the Giant before 93,173 fans to hand the big man the first loss of his career, it set the all time record for the most lies in a single sentence.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20III
"WrestleMania IV was the fourth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . It took place on March 27, 1988, at the Historic Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The announced attendance of the event was 19,199, drawing a 6.5 buyrate on PPV. The main event featured as the finals of a one night fourteen man single elimination tournament for the Undisputed WWF Heavyweight Championship, in which Randy Savage defeated Ted DiBiase to win the vacant title. The main matches on the undercard were a twenty man battle royal won by Bad News Brown, Demolition Ax and Smash versus Strike Force Tito Santana and Rick Martel for the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Brutus Beefcake versus The Honky Tonk Man for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. WrestleMania IV was a professional wrestling event held by the World Wrestling Federation, and was the fourth iteration of WrestleMania, first held in 1985. The event was held March 27, 1988, at the Historic Atlantic City Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey. This event along with WrestleMania V would be advertised as being held at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, with both events taking place across the road at Convention Hall, but sponsored by Donald Trump. The two events would be the only time that WrestleMania would be held at the same venue in consecutive years. The attendance for the event was announced as 19,199, who paid a total of 1,400,000 in admission fees. This total was significantly reduced from that of the previous year's event, which sat at 93,173, and would stay similar to the following year's 20,369. Much of the promotion of the event featured the continued rivalry of Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who had faced off in the previous edition's main event. This would take place inside of a single elimination ten man tournament for the vacant world championship. The event was broadcast across closed circuit television to 175,000 homes, and also on pay per view PPV drawing a 6.5 buyrate, which was reduced from 8.0 the previous year. WrestleMania IV featured a card, which contained matches that involved wrestlers from pre existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character. As a narrative, events are usually pre planned in order to promote a show, or match. The main plotline for the event featured a ten man tournament, including a rematch of WrestleMania III's main event. The most heavily promoted feud heading into the event was between Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, similar to the year before when the two met at WrestleMania III. In January 1987, Hogan was awarded a trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion, while Hogan's on screen friend Andre was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's for being undefeated in the WWF for the previous fifteen years. Hogan congratulated Andre over winning the award, but Andre exited the arena before Hogan's speech was finished. In February, on an episode of Piper's Pit, Andre announced his new manager, Bobby Heenan, Hogan's longtime on screen rival. Hogan asked Andre to leave Heenan, to which Andre refused. Andre then challenged Hogan to a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania III, before ripping off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden cross necklace, turning from an on screen hero to villan heel . At WrestleMania III Hogan defeated Andre to retain the title. At the first Survivor Series in November 1987, Andre along with team members One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude defeated Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow in a traditional Survivor Series match. Shortly after Survivor Series, during Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship defense against Bundy, Andre sneak attacked Hogan, applying a choke hold. Heel character Ted DiBiase was portrayed as The Million Dollar Man , an evil millionaire, offered Hogan a large sum of money to sell DiBiase the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, to which Hogan refused. At the first Royal Rumble in January 1988, Hogan and Andre had an official contract signing for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship rematch. Their rematch took place on The Main Event I in February, where Andre defeated Hogan with a dusty finish. Andre won the match when referee Dave Hebner's identical twin Earl Hebner made the decision. Shortly after being awarded the championship, Andre would kayfabe sell the title to DiBiase. Whilst Andre's championship reign is recognised by the WWF, DiBiase would be stripped of the title. Plotwise, WWF President Jack Tunney vacated the title due to it having not been won in a sanctioned match and ordered it to be decided in a single elimination 14 man tournament at WrestleMania IV. As previous champions, Andre and Hogan would get a bye to the second round of the tournament, but would face each other in their second round matchup. Hogan would form an unlikely alliance with former enemy and top challenger to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Randy Macho Man Savage which was later known as the Mega Powers . Savage had been portrayed as an egomaniacal heel during most of his first two years in the WWF, but in the late summer of 1987 began to slowly turn face. Their on screen friendship, then, was formed when Hogan at the persuasion of Savage's valet, Miss Elizabeth intervened when Savage was being attacked by The Honky Tonk Man and the Hart Foundation in an angle. Although Hogan and Savage teamed together at un televised house shows, nothing more was made of it on national television until shortly before WrestleMania IV, when Hogan rescued Savage a similar angle featuring Andre, DiBiase and Virgil. Lower on the card, Brutus Beefcake was challenging for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, held by The Honky Tonk Man. Beefcake who had the gimmick of a haircutter who would regularly cut wrestler's hair after matches had previous experience of Honky having tagged previously had vowed to cut his ducktail hair. Honky, meanwhile, was portrayed as a cowardly champion, frequently relying on outside interference from manager Jimmy Hart or on screen girlfriend Peggy Sue to win matches, or intentionally getting himself counted out or disqualified to retain his championship with the champions advantage. Having debuted the year previously, in his first major feud, The Ultimate Warrior began battling with Hercules over which character was the stronger, gladiatorial style superstar was in the WWF. During a match on WWF television, Hercules attacked Warrior with his steel chain after a chain match in an angle. The British Bulldogs and The Islanders had feuded since the late fall of 1987. The Islanders would take the Bulldogs' mascot, Matilda the bulldog, from ringside. Bobby Heenan, manager of the Islanders commented on the legality of having animals at ringside rather than official managers. This included a remark on Koko B. Ware's macaw who accompanied him to ringside. This would lead to a Six man tag team match with manager Heenan tagging with the Islanders against the Bulldogs and Ware. WrestleMania IV's coverage began with Gladys Knight singing a rendition of America the Beautiful . The first match of the pay per view event was a twenty man over the top rope battle royal. The winner of the match would receive a trophy. After fourteen eliminations, the final six participants were Bad News Brown, Bret Hart, Paul Roma, Harley Race, Jacques Rougeau, and Junkyard Dog. Race hit a back body drop on Rougeau sending him over the top rope before Junkyard Dog punched him over the top rope. Brown eliminated Roma as Junkyard Dog was left to battle Hart and Brown. The duo double teamed Dog before Brown attempted a clothesline on Dog but hit Hart instead. Junkyard Dog hit both men with several headbutts before they both decided to cooperate and they eliminated Junkyard Dog. After eliminating Dog, Hart indicated that he and Brown would share the trophy however, Brown caught Hart with his Ghetto Blaster before eliminating him over the top rope to win the battle royal. Brown was presented with the trophy, but Hart interrupted and hit Brown with the trophy. Hart and partner Jim Neidhart would later turn babyface over the next few months. Before the fourteen man tournament for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship began, Robin Leach from the TV show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous outlined the background for the tournament, and how the championship was vacated. In the first round, The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase with bodyguard Virgil and Andre the Giant defeated Hacksaw Jim Duggan by pinfall. The Rock Don Muraco with Superstar Billy Graham defeated Dino Bravo with Frenchy Martin by disqualification after Bravo pulled the referee in front of him, causing the referee to be hit by a flying forearm from Muraco. Macho Man Randy Savage with Miss Elizabeth defeated The Natural Butch Reed with Slick , Greg The Hammer Valentine with The Mouth of the South Jimmy Hart defeated Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, the One Man Gang with Slick defeated Bam Bam Bigelow with Oliver Humperdink , and Ravishing Rick Rude with Bobby The Brain Heenan fought Jake The Snake Roberts to a time limit draw. The winners of these matches advanced to the quarterfinals. As Rude and Roberts tied, they were both eliminated from the tournament, thereby giving the One Man Gang a bye into the semifinals. As former champions, Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan were given a bye and had directly qualified for the next round. In his PPV debut, The Ultimate Warrior faced Hercules. The pair locked up with Warrior chopping Hercules in the corner. Hercules fought back as he hit two clotheslines on Warrior, who no sold them before a third from Hercules took Warrior off his feet. Warrior then countered a Hercules clothesline and hit a clothesline of his own. In the corner, Warrior hit him with ten punches, but while Warrior was looking at the referee, Hercules hit an inverted atomic drop. He then tried to apply his finishing move, a full nelson but could not lock his fingers behind Warriors head. Warrior then pushed his feet off the top turnbuckle and both men fell to the mat with both men being pinned. Warrior lifted a shoulder before the end of the count, awarding Warrior the win. The first of three quarterfinals saw Hulk Hogan take on Andre the Giant. During the match, Hogan hit Andre with a chair in front of referee Joey Marella. Andre would retaliate, grabbing the chair and hitting Hogan. After both men hit each other with the chair, they both were disqualified by Marella and, as a result, they both were eliminated from the tournament. The second quarterfinal saw Ted DiBiase without either Andre or Virgil after Virgil had been Suplexed in the aisle by Hulk Hogan defeated Don Muraco by pinfall. With both of Andre and Hogan disqualified, DiBiase would get a bye to the final. The third quarterfinal saw Randy Savage defeat Greg Valentine also by pinfall. As One Man Gang had received a bye in the quarter finals due to Rick Rude and Jake Roberts having wrestled to a time limit draw in the first round Gang would face Savage in the semi finals. Brutus The Barber Beefcake fought WWF Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental championship. Early in the match, Beefcake connected with an atomic drop at the outset of the matchup. Beefcake then hit Honky with a high knee, before missing an elbow drop on Honky, who took control with a second turnbuckle fist drop. Honky went for his Swinging neckbreaker called Shake, Rattle Roll on Beefcake but instead Beefcake kneed him in the face. Beefcake would put Honky in a sleeper hold. With Beefcake in charge of the match, Honky's manager Jimmy Hart hit the referee with his megaphone. The bell didn't ring but it was announced that Beefcake won by disqualification, which meant that Honky was still the champion. Post match, with Honky Tonk apparently knocked out in the ring, Beefcake cut the hair of Hart with his barber shears. The Islanders Haku and Tama and manager Bobby Heenan took on The British Bulldogs Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid and Koko B. Ware in a six man tag team match. Dynamite and Tama started the match with Dynamite catapulting Tama over the top rope. Smith tagged in but missed an elbow drop on Tama, allowing Tama to tag Haku. Smith hit a flying crossbody on Haku for a near fall. Haku hit an arm wrench and tagged Tama. Tama grabbed Smith's arm and came out of it with a military press slam. Tama tagged in Haku who put Davey in a backbreaker but Smith flipped out of it and tagged in Koko. He hit Haku with a missile dropkick and a Frankensteiner. Dynamite tagged in and clotheslined Haku before ran into Haku's boot. As a cowardly manager, Heenan tagged and stomped Dynamite before quickly tagging out to Tama. Tama hit a back body drop on Dynamite but missed a big splash to allow Dynamite to tag Koko whilst Tama tagged Haku. Both members of the Islanders would square up to Koko prompting the Bulldogs to enter the ring. All six men brawled in the ring before being separated by the referee, who ordered the Bulldogs into their corner. The Islanders used this distraction to pick up Heenan and throw him onto Koko, leading to a pinfall victory. Next, Randy Savage faced One Man Gang for a place in the final of the tournament. Ted DiBiase had already receiving a bye in the semi finals due to the double disqualification of Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, and would meet the victor. Savage hit a hotshot on the One Man Gang, but Gang quickly took control of the match. Gang would attempt a 747 splash, but miss after Savage dodged and later fell to the outside as Savage connected with a diving double axe handle. Savage then went for a scoop slam which failed. One Man Gang's manager Slick jumped on the apron and handed One Man Gang a cane which he hit Savage with and attempted to jab him as he lay on the mat but Savage kept rolling away. The referee caught Gang using his cane and disqualified him awarding the match to Savage. Before the final round, Strike Force Tito Santana and Rick Martel defended the WWF World Tag Team Championship against Demolition Ax and Smash with their manager Mr. Fuji in their corner. The match started with Strike Force hitting Smash with a double back elbow for a near fall. Santana applied an armbar on Ax before Martel tagged in and applied an armbar but Ax headbutted him and tagged out to Smash. Santana tagged in but was caught in a bear hug and was clotheslined by Ax, before a scoop slam and suplex on Santana. Santana hit a flying forearm smash on an interfering Smash and tagged in Martel who dropkicked both Ax and Smash a number of times and applied a Boston crab on Smash. Santana grabbed Mr. Fuji up onto the apron, allowing Ax to get his manager's cane. He nailed Martel with it as Smash covered Martel with a pin. As a result, Demolition won the match, and the WWF Tag Team Champions. The main event of WrestleMania IV was the tournament final for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship between Macho Man Randy Savage and The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase. DiBiase was accompanied to the ring by Andre The Giant, whilst Savage his regular valet Miss Elizabeth. Savage had wrestled three prior matches, whilst DiBiase had wrestled one less, received a bye from the quarterfinals. DiBiase controlled much of the match, before a fightback from Savage, and attempted a top rope elbow drop on DiBiase but DiBiase moved out of the way. DiBiase applied a Million Dollar Dream submission on Savage. To aid Savage, Elizabeth would go backstage and bring Hulk Hogan to ringside to neutralize Andre being at ringside. Andre the Giant would interfere in the match on behalf of DiBiase, and whilst the referee was distracted, Hogan would attack DiBiase with a steel chair. Savage climbed up the top rope for a second elbow drop attempt and hit the Savage Elbow. He followed it up with a pinfall victory. He won the tournament and the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Hogan, Elizabeth and Savage celebrated Savage's WWF Championship win. Rob McNew of 411Mania.com WrestleMania IV received mixed to poor reviews from critics. Most reviews criticized the show's length as well as the number of matches. Rob McNew from 411Mania.com gave the show a 3.5 10 rating when reviewing the show, claiming the show was bad . McNew was frustrated by the number of matches on the show, and the size of the tournament, saying This show could have been so much better had they trimmed the tournament down to eight guys from fourteen. Instead we got a bunch of short matches, none of which ended up being memorable. The show had its moments, and isn't all terrible. Just way too long. Savage Dibiase provides a great moment, but the rest of the show is a pass. Retoprowrestling.com were also highly critical of the show's length, calling it a chore to watch , and that there's probably nothing wrong with a wrestling pay per view running nigh on four hours, but when about three and a half of those hours don't actually feature much in the way of entertainment, it often feels like you've spent your entire weekend just watching this one show. John Canton of TJR wrestling called the event a below average show , citing the event being a 16 match card. Thats too many matches. Canton also commented on the length of these matches, and primary usage of rest holds , and bad finishes. Bryan Rose from Voices of Wrestling called the show a dud , before stating there was a lot of nothing for 3 1 2 hours. Rose also suggested similarities that the event's length had to watching two Godfather films. Mike Powell of prowrestling.net called the event really bad , and commented that had the show been less than three hours in length, rather than 4, it would have been an allround better show. However, John Powell, from SLAM Wrestling called the event excellent , saying that the show's greatness comes from its unpredictability. Powell, says that the show was another tricky venture for Vince McMahon and he hits the jackpot again. Powell was very positive about the show's tournament, stating that it and Savage's title win was the highlights of the night. Bret Mix from Wrestling DVD Network commented on the structure of the event, before calling the event average , but underrated for its high quality of matches throughout the show, despite the number of matches. As an event in the annual WrestleMania series of events, WrestleMania IV is considered to be one of the weaker events with reviews commenting that the event was mostly notable for a year long feud between Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan that preceded the event, with the two facing off a year later at WrestleMania V. Scott Keith of SmarK rant gave the event a recommendation to avoid , and commented it was long, boring and dull , and that the event was simply to serve as a prelude to WrestleMania V In the months that followed the event, Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on multiple occasions, primarily against DiBiase but also granted title shots to others such as the One Man Gang and Bad News Brown. Hogan, meanwhile, took a leave of absence from the WWF during the late spring and part of the summer to film the movie No Holds Barred. Andre the Giant was shortly placed in a feud with Hacksaw Jim Duggan, however, the DiBiase Andre alliance was renewed when the two attacked Savage during a television taping for the WWF's syndicated show Superstars of Wrestling. DiBiase and Andre would offer a tag team match to Savage at the inaugural SummerSlam, where Savage would chose to partner Hogan and create the The Mega Powers . The team of Hogan and Savage won the match before Savage would turn heel against Hogan at The Main Event II. Hogan would challenge Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V, with Hogan winning the title. Having interfered in Duggan's match at the event, Hacksaw confronted Andre, and attacked him with his 2x4. This storyline would come to an end before Superstars of Wrestling. Having wrestled to a time limit draw in the championship tournament, Jake Roberts and Rick Rude were placed into a feud regarding Rude making kayfabe advances over Robert's real life wife, Cheryl. The Honky Tonk Man continued to feud with Brutus Beefcake over the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship during the spring and summer of 1988, with Honky retaining the championship by being intentionally counted out or disqualified on multiple occasions. Beefcake was granted a final match at SummerSlam, but was sneak attacked by Ron Bass one week before the event. Honky would then lose his championship at Summerslam to a returning Ultimate Warrior. Demolition would defend the tag team championships against both Strike Force and The British Bulldogs. The Demolition Strike Force feud came to an end in June 1988 when, during a televised match, Ax and Smash kayfabe injured Rick Martel by repeatedly using their finishing move, the Demolition Decapitation on him. Following this, The British Bulldogs and The Young Stallions, and later another power team, The Powers of Pain The Barbarian and The Warlord , became Demolition's primary challengers. Following Bret Hart's elimination from the battle royal, he returned to the ring to challenge Bad News Brown. Bret would see a face turn, alongside partner Jim Neidhart. The pair would also engage in a new feud with The Fabulous Rougeaus. WrestleMania IV was later released on VHS, and would become the only WrestleMania event to be released over two VHS tapes. The event would later be released in 2014 on the WWE Network. Pin Pinfall CO Countout DQ Disqualification DDQ Double disqualification",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20IV
"WrestleMania IX was the ninth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . The event took place at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada, on April 4, 1993, and was the first WrestleMania event held outdoors. WrestleMania IX was built around two main storylines. The first was the seemingly unstoppable Yokozuna challenging Bret Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event, a right he earned by winning the 1993 Royal Rumble. The other major storyline was the return of Hulk Hogan, who had departed the WWF following WrestleMania VIII but returned to team with Brutus Beefcake against the WWF Tag Team Champions, Money Inc. Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster . Hogan and Beefcake lost the tag team match, but Hogan later faced Yokozuna for the title in an impromptu, unadvertised 22 second match after Yokozuna defeated Hart to win the championship. In addition, Shawn Michaels retained the Intercontinental Championship, though he lost his match against Tatanka. Several reviewers have been critical of the event. The most frequent criticism has been related to the match between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, Hulk Hogan's title win, and the Roman togas worn by announcers. Both the pay per view buyrate and the attendance for the event dropped from the previous year's WrestleMania. Early TV promos for WrestleMania IX ticket sales, airing in December 1992, focused on shots of Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart, with quick shots of Doink the Clown, Razor Ramon, Crush, Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, and Randy Savage also shown. Hogan had noteably not appeared on WWF TV since April of that year. Flair would not be on the roster at the time of the event. This was the first WrestleMania held entirely outdoors, a concept the company did not use again until WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Because WrestleMania IX was held in Caesars Palace, the WWF promoted the event as the World's Largest Toga Party . The arena was made to look like a Roman coliseum, and the event featured guards, trumpeters, and several live animals. The company built on this theme by having the commentators, including debuting announcer Jim Ross, wear togas. Ring announcer Howard Finkel was also renamed Finkus Maximus for the day. Randy Savage came to the broadcast booth accompanied by women throwing flower petals and feeding him grapes while he rode on a couch carried by guards. Bobby Heenan made his entrance wearing a toga and riding a camel backwards. Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was explained in the storyline as the result of Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married the couple divorced in September 1992 . WWF officials claimed that the injury was the result of a Jet Ski accident. A match was scheduled between Bam Bam Bigelow and Kamala, but it was canceled due to time constraints before the event began. The buildup to the pay per view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and the matches that took place at the event had pre determined outcomes that had been decided by the promotion. One of the feuds heading into the event was between Tatanka and Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Tatanka was in the midst of an undefeated streak and had wrestled Michaels twice in the months leading up to WrestleMania IX. Tatanka pinned Michaels in a singles match on the February 13, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling and later teamed with The Nasty Boys in a six man match against Michaels and the Beverly Brothers Tatanka pinned Michaels to win this match as well. Michaels was also feuding with Sensational Sherri, who stood in Tatanka's corner during the match. Sherri had been Michaels' valet. When Marty Jannetty tried to hit Michaels with a mirror, however, Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself. Sherri's anger at getting hit over the head with a mirror caused her to turn on him at Royal Rumble 1993. The match between The Steiner Brothers Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner and The Headshrinkers Samu and Fatu had little background, although Afa, who managed The Headshrinkers, claimed that his team would tear the Steiners' heads off . Doink the Clown and Crush had been feuding since the January 2, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. After Crush's match on that show, he confronted Doink, who had thrown a ball at a child in the audience. Crush grabbed Doink by the arm and warned him not to play any more pranks on children. Doink, wearing a cast on the arm that Crush had supposedly injured by grabbing, came to ringside during Crush's match on the January 18 episode of WWF Monday Night Raw. He apologized to Crush and gave him a flower when Crush walked away, Doink removed a prosthetic arm from his cast and attacked Crush, who was later taken away in an ambulance due to kayfabe storyline injuries. For storyline purposes, Crush was said to be too injured to compete in the 1993 Royal Rumble match. Doink continued his pranks by squirting Crush with a water pistol and recording video messages to Crush, which showed two Doinks on the screen. The feud between The Mega Maniacs Brutus Beefcake and Hulk Hogan and WWF Tag Team Champions Money Inc. Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster stemmed from a legitimate parasailing accident in 1990 that forced Beefcake to undergo reconstructive surgery to his face. He was unable to wrestle again until the February 15, 1993, episode of Raw. He faced DiBiase in his return match, after which DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart, who managed Money Inc., repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. Schyster then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart later claimed that he felt the need to step up and do the right thing and that he had a change of heart , and his intervention led to him becoming a babyface, or crowd favorite. Shortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to the WWF and joined with Beefcake, and manager Jimmy Hart, to form The Mega Maniacs and challenge Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Mr. Perfect's rivalry with Bobby Heenan dated back to Survivor Series 1992 . Perfect and Ric Flair were managed by Heenan, but Perfect turned on Flair and Heenan by agreeing to face them as part of a tag team match at Survivor Series. Flair feuded briefly with Perfect but left the company to return to World Championship Wrestling. Lex Luger had joined Vince McMahon's World Bodybuilding Federation, but he signed with McMahon's WWF when the bodybuilding company failed. He made his debut at Royal Rumble 1993, where he was unveiled as Heenan's latest wrestler, Narcissus although the ring name was changed to The Narcissist Lex Luger . The Undertaker's feud with Giant Gonzalez was an offshoot of The Undertaker's feud with manager Harvey Wippleman. The Undertaker defeated Kamala, who was managed by Wippleman, at SummerSlam 1992. A rematch was held at Survivor Series 1992, and The Undertaker beat Kamala in a coffin match. Wippleman vowed revenge, and he introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993 and instructed him to attack The Undertaker. The Undertaker was eliminated from the Royal Rumble match as a result of the interference, and a match was scheduled between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez for WrestleMania IX. Beginning with his debut with the company in 1992, Yokozuna was pushed by the WWF as an unstoppable monster heel. Weighing over 500 pounds, he used the Banzai Drop, a move in which he jumped from the second rope and sat on his opponent's chest, to defeat several of the WWF's biggest stars. In a notable match on the February 6, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Yokozuna attacked Hacksaw Jim Duggan and performed the Banzai Drop four times. Due to the kayfabe injuries from the attack, Duggan was unable to wrestle for over two months. Yokozuna earned a title shot against WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart by winning the 1993 Royal Rumble match. During the contract signing, Yokozuna attacked Hart and performed the Banzai Drop on him. Before the televised broadcast began, Tito Santana defeated Papa Shango in a dark match, which became available for viewing on April 4 2019 in the Hidden Gems section on WWE Network and is also notable as the WWE debut of Jim Ross on commentary . Actress and Singer Diahann Carroll sang a rendition of America the Beautiful before the show. In the first match of the pay per view event, WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels was accompanied to the ring by a new valet, Luna Vachon. Sensational Sherri followed Tatanka to the ring to prevent Vachon from getting involved in the match. During the match, Vachon approached Tatanka twice outside the ring, but Sherri was able to intervene and stop Vachon from interfering. Tatanka spent much of the match trying to injure Michaels with an armbar hold. Michaels gained the advantage and almost pinned Tatanka with a victory roll, but Tatanka escaped the pin attempt and performed a war dance to channel his energy. Michaels threw Tatanka out of the ring and tried to jump at him to attack, but Tatanka moved. Michaels was unable to return to the ring within ten seconds he pulled the referee out of the ring. Tatanka was awarded the victory by countout but did not win the championship because titles can only change hands as a result of pinfall or submission. Vachon attacked Sherri after the match, and Tatanka had to help Sherri make it back to the dressing rooms. In the next match, the Steiner Brothers Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner faced The Headshrinkers Samu and Fatu . The advantage switched back and forth several times, as the Steiners threw The Headshrinkers with several suplex variations and used their aerial abilities to attack their opponents from the ring ropes. The Headshrinkers relied mainly on using their power to wear down the Steiners. At one point, Fatu picked Rick Steiner up on his shoulders so that Samu could attack Rick from the top rope. Rick caught Samu instead and performed a bodyslam on Samu from Fatu's shoulders. The match ended when Scott Steiner performed a Frankensteiner to pin Samu and win the match. Crush attacked Doink the Clown outside the ring prior to the next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious as a result of this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown portrayed by Steve Keirn was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness. Razor Ramon faced Bob Backlund next. Ramon used his power to dominate the majority of the match, but Backlund used hip tosses to attempt a comeback. Ramon won the match in under four minutes by pinning Backlund with a small package. In the following match, Money Inc. Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against The Mega Maniacs Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake . Beefcake wore a protective titanium facemask because of his injured face, and Hulk Hogan came to the ring with a black eye, which led the announcers to speculate about the cause. Money Inc. gained the early advantage, but DiBiase soon injured himself by hitting Beefcake's mask. Hogan and Beefcake brawled with their enemies and controlled the match until Money Inc. was counted out. Referee Earl Hebner announced, however, that he would strip them of their title if they did not return to the ring and continue the match. DiBiase returned to the ring and rendered Hogan unconscious with the Million Dollar Dream chokehold. Beefcake attacked DiBiase by applying a sleeper hold and then turned his attention to Schyster, but DiBiase hit him in the back with Schyster's briefcase. Money Inc. attacked Beefcake and removed his facemask, but Beefcake fought back and applied a sleeper hold to Schyster. The referee was accidentally knocked unconscious, and Hogan recovered and attacked both members of Money Inc. with Beefcake's facemask. He tried to make the cover for a pinfall, but the referee still unconscious. Manager Jimmy Hart turned his jacket inside out to reveal a striped referee jacket he made the three count and declared The Mega Maniacs the winners of the match. Referee Danny Davis came to the ring and disqualified Hogan for using the facemask as a weapon. Money Inc. won the match and retained their championship, but The Mega Maniacs threw them out of the ring and opened Schyster's briefcase to reveal stacks of cash. They celebrated in the ring and threw the money into the crowd. Lex Luger was accompanied to the ring by four women dressed in bikinis as he prepared to face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate as the result of a legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage. In the next match, The Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. Both men tried to use their size and power to control the match. Gonzalez used a reverse chinlock to wear The Undertaker down and attacked him outside the ring. The Undertaker regained control of the match and knocked Gonzalez onto his knees. Harvey Wippleman threw Gonzalez a rag soaked with chloroform, which Gonzalez used to knock The Undertaker unconscious. The referee disqualified Gonzalez for using a foreign object and awarded the match to The Undertaker. After the match, The Undertaker recovered and attacked Giant Gonzalez. In the main event and final scheduled match on the card, Bret Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Yokozuna. Hart tried to use his technical wrestling abilities against Yokozuna, while Yokozuna relied on his size advantage in the match. Hart gained control at the beginning, but Yokozuna came back with a clothesline, leg drop, and nerve hold. Hart regained the advantage when Yokozuna missed a running splash. Yokozuna applied another nerve hold but missed a running splash again. He recovered and carried Hart to the middle of the ring, but Hart removed the protective padding on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring. He threw Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle and applied the Sharpshooter, his signature submission hold that stretches the opponent's legs and back. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, which enabled Yokozuna to pin Hart and win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Hulk Hogan came to ring to check on Hart's condition. Hogan had stated during an interview earlier in the broadcast that he wanted to face the winner of the match, and Fuji challenged Hogan to face Yokozuna immediately in an impromptu bout. Hogan agreed and entered the ring. Fuji tried to throw salt in Hogan's eyes, but he missed and the salt hit Yokozuna. Hogan performed a leg drop and pinned Yokozuna to win the title in 22 seconds. The event was attended by 16,891 fans, who paid a total of 1,100,000 in admission fees. This represents less than one third of the number of fans at WrestleMania VIII, which had an attendance of 62,167. The pay per view drew a 2.3 buyrate, which was lower than the previous year's 2.8 buyrate. It was higher, however, than the buyrates for any of the following four WrestleManias. WrestleMania IX received overwhelmingly negative reviews. The event has received criticism for what some reviewers have perceived as a poorly booked event. Writing for SLAM Wrestling, John Powell states that, aside from the Intercontinental and Tag Team Championship matches and the scantily clad women that accompanied Lex Luger to the ring, the rest of the broadcast was poor. He is also critical of some of the outfits worn for the event, notably Jim Ross's toga and Giant Gonzalez's spray painted suit. Reviewing the event for Online Onslaught, Adam Gutschmidt claims that several of the matches flowed poorly and had ill conceived conclusions. He also claims that the match between Giant Gonzalez and The Undertaker was a dud and that Hulk Hogan's ego made the conclusion the worst WrestleMania ending ever . RD Reynolds, owner of the website WrestleCrap, has inducted the event into the site's list of the very worst in pro wrestling . He cites Giant Gonzalez, Papa Shango, Luger's narcissist gimmick, and Jim Ross wearing a toga as his reasons for including the event in the list. WWE places two events from WrestleMania IX in its top 50 WrestleMania moments Bobby Heenan's entrance on the camel, which the company calls one of the most hilarious moments in WWE history , and Hulk Hogan's title victory. Matt Anoa'i, who wrestled for WWE as Rosey, and was the cousin of Yokozuna, Samu and Fatu, has identified The Headshrinkers performing a double splash on Scott Steiner at this event as his favorite moment at WrestleMania. WrestleMania IX was released on VHS by Coliseum Video. It was then released as part of the WWF's WrestleMania The Collection 19851997 box set in 1997. The video was re released six years later in March 1999. That month, it was also released as part of the WWF's WrestleMania The Legacy box set. It was also released on DVD for WWE's History of WrestleMania I IX box set on September 14, 2004. In the United Kingdom, the event was released on VHS on July 5, 1993. Packaged together with WrestleMania X, it was released on DVD for the WWE Tagged Classics series on May 8, 2006. A feud began between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect after WrestleMania IX as a result of Michaels attacking Perfect. They faced each other at SummerSlam 1993, and Michaels won by countout after his new bodyguard, Diesel attacked Perfect. Perfect then feuded with Diesel until leaving the WWF. Money Inc. lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to the Steiner Brothers on June 14, 1993. Money Inc. won the belts back in a rematch on June 16, but the Steiners won them again three days later. Money Inc. received several rematches but were unable to regain the title they soon focused on singles competition, and DiBiase retired at the end of August. The Undertaker continued to feud with Harvey Wippleman. On the June 12, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Wippleman, Giant Gonzalez, and Mr. Hughes attacked The Undertaker, and his manager Paul Bearer, and stole the urn that was said to be the source of his power. The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez faced each other one final time at SummerSlam 1993 in a Rest in Peace match, in which neither wrestler could be disqualified. The Undertaker won the match to end the feud. After the match, a frustrated Gonzalez chokeslammed Wippleman to the delight of the fans and turned face in the process. Bret Hart later claimed that during a conversation with Vince McMahon, he was told that Hulk Hogan refused to drop the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to him. However, Hulk Hogan stated that, during a conversation with Vince McMahon, a deal was made for Hogan to drop the belt to the top heel at the time, Yokozuna, at the following King of The Ring. All three men eventually wound up in a meeting, where McMahon outlined the plan to have Hogan drop the belt to Yokozuna and denied telling Bret that Hogan refused to drop the championship to him. After regaining the title, Yokozuna challenged any American athlete to bodyslam him on the deck of the USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his gimmick to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993 he won the match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20IX
"WrestleMania X was the 10th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF . It took place at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York on March 20, 1994. The central focus of the pay per view was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which was defended in two matches. Lex Luger challenged champion Yokozuna first but was disqualified for pushing the referee. Bret Hart faced Yokozuna later in the evening and won the championship by pinning Yokozuna. This led to a lengthy worked feud between Bret and his brother Owen, who had defeated Bret in the opening match of the pay per view. Several other major feuds were also highlighted at this event. Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match to resolve an angle in which the two had argued over the rightful holder of the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Bam Bam Bigelow gained revenge against Doink the Clown, with whom he had been feuding, by teaming with Luna Vachon to defeat Doink and his partner Dink. Randy Savage also settled his feud with Crush by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match. WrestleMania X was the first edition of the event not to include Hulk Hogan, who had been seen as the public face of the WWF following Hogan's 1993 departure, that role had shifted to Bret Hart. The card also marked Randy Savage's last televised match for the company. The storyline surrounding the WWF World Heavyweight Championship began at the 1994 Royal Rumble when the final two wrestlers, Lex Luger and Bret Hart, simultaneously eliminated each other. After a disagreement between two referees, Jack Tunney, the WWF President, declared Luger and Hart co winners. Tunney announced that both wrestlers would get a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania, the prize given to the winner of the Royal Rumble match, and both wrestlers would have to wrestle two matches for the pay per view. Tunney announced that a coin toss would be used to decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first. If Luger won, he would face Yokozuna first. Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger Yokozuna match. If Hart won the coin toss, he would get the first title shot, and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card. On the January 31, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first. Bret Hart was booked to face his brother Owen, with whom he was in the middle of a feud. The storyline between the Hart brothers began at Survivor Series 1993, where they were competing on the same side of an elimination match. As Owen was fighting in the ring, Bret, who had sustained a kayfabe injury, was staggering along the ring apron. Owen ran into Bret, causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret. In the following weeks, Owen demanded a match with Bret, but Bret refused to accept the challenge. Eventually, the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret sustained another kayfabe injury, causing the referee to end the match. In a planned turn, Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud. Luger's feud with Yokozuna began on July 4, 1993, at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge. In June, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, challenged all American athletes to attempt to bodyslam Yokozuna on the deck of the USS Intrepid. After several athletes failed, the storyline saw Luger arrive by helicopter and successfully bodyslam Yokozuna. This began a strong push for Luger, who was then scheduled to challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993. Luger won the match by countout but did not win the title. The WWF claimed that the match stipulations did not allow Luger a rematch. The storyline saw Luger campaigning for entry into the 1994 Royal Rumble, as he wanted the title shot that would be given to the winner. Luger was eventually entered into the match, although The Great Kabuki and Genichiro Tenryu were also entered, on Mr. Fuji's behalf, to attempt to prevent Luger from winning. Kabuki and Tenryu were unsuccessful, however, as Luger won the match and gained a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The storyline leading to the match between Macho Man Randy Savage and Crush focused on the supposedly strained friendship between the two wrestlers. On the July 12, 1993, episode of Monday Night Raw, Crush challenged Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. At the end of the match, Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop to win the match. After the match, he performed three more Banzai Drops while various wrestlers ran to the ring to stop the attack. Savage eventually came to the ring to help Crush. Following the match, Crush was not seen on televised matches for several months, although he continued to appear at house shows. On October 18, Crush appeared on Monday Night Raw accompanied by Yokozuna and Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji. Crush criticized Savage for not intervening sooner during the July 12 match. In a worked promo, Crush announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States in order to align himself with Yokozuna and Fuji. He then attacked Savage by dropping him on the ringside guard rail. Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop on Savage before a group of referees came to the ring to break up the fight. During the November 8, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw, Savage left his position as commentator to attack Crush. The following week, Jack Tunney announced that Savage was suspended from commentating as a result of the previous week's attack. The feud intensified at Survivor Series 1993 when Savage and Crush caused each other to be eliminated from their respective matches. Bam Bam Bigelow and Doink the Clown were engaged in a feud that began in the fall of 1993. Doink annoyed Bigelow with a series of pranks, such as throwing water and confetti on him and tripping him with a broom. Bigelow retaliated against Doink and Doink's midget sidekick Dink. A match was booked for Survivor Series 1993, but Bigelow was unable to get revenge because Doink did not compete. Instead, the WWF prolonged the feud by having Bigelow's team face was The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission dressed as Doinks. The feud eventually culminated in a match scheduled for WrestleMania X. In the match, Bigelow and his storyline girlfriend Luna Vachon competed against Doink and Dink in a Mixed tag team match. The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to the fall of 1993. Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains. In a dark match before the pay per view aired, The Heavenly Bodies faced The Bushwhackers. Near the end of the match, The Bushwhackers gained control when they performed the Battering Ram on Jimmy Del Ray. Tom Prichard, Del Ray's partner, attacked Bushwhacker Butch before he was able to pin Del Ray. This allowed Del Ray to recover and pin Butch to win the match. As the broadcast began, Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler were introduced as commentators for the event and Little Richard sang America the Beautiful . The first televised match was between Bret and Owen Hart. The beginning of the match went back and forth with neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage. The tension between the two was demonstrated by Owen's bragging and Bret's refusal to let Owen leave the ring. Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver. When Owen stood outside the ring to recuperate, Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him. Bret landed awkwardly, however, and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee. Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret's sore leg. Bret was able to recover, and he kicked Owen in the back of the head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen. Owen regained the advantage, however, and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret. Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen. Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll, but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match. Sy Sperling, the president of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men, appeared in the ring before the next match. He announced that he was at WrestleMania to introduce one of his latest clients, ring announcer Howard Finkel. Finkel came to the ring wearing a toupee, showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded. The match then began, as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink. Bigelow attacked Doink at the beginning of the match with a dropkick and a powerslam. When Dink entered the match, the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match. Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon, but she eventually caught him. She kicked him and powerslammed him, but she then missed a moonsault attempt. Doink and Bigelow re entered the match, and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow. Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink. Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match, and he and Vachon then attacked Dink. The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he then had to make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush reversed the attack. He used a tilt a whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner. Alundra Blayze defended her WWF Women's Championship against Leilani Kai in the next match. Blayze began the match by using a leg sweep and two sunset flips. Kai came back with a powerslam and a suplex. Blayze got the win, however, by pinning Kai after performing a German suplex. In the next match, Men on a Mission challenged The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but did not get a pinfall. Men on a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring. Men on a Mission won the match by countout, but they did not win the belts. The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger challenged Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect was revealed to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After getting back into the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from a corner of the ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel. Adam Bomb and his manager Harvey Wippleman entered the ring for the next match, and Wippleman criticized Finkel's new hair and tore the pocket off Finkel's suit. Earthquake came to the ring and attacked Bomb from behind. He powerslammed Bomb and performed the Earthquake splash to get the pinfall victory in thirty five seconds. For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts belonging to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, and the first wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel to return to the dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up in the corner of the ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental Championship. A ten man tag team match was supposed to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett could not agree on who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 123 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly Sparky Plugg , stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match. The final match of the night and main event was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart. The guest referee for the match was Rowdy Roddy Piper, while the guest ring announcer was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth. Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell, and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain. Eventually, Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat. Cornette tried to distract Piper, but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt. Bret maintained the advantage for a little while, but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex. When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop, however, he lost his balance and fell to the mat. Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title. He celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Razor Ramon, Tatanka, The 123 Kid, Sparky Plugg and Macho Man Randy Savage. Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds, Rhonda Shear, Donnie Wahlberg, and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon. Owen Hart stood in the aisle, glaring at Bret, then quickly left. The event was attended by 18,065 people, who paid a total of 960,000 in admission fees. The buyrate for this pay per view was 1.68, down from the 2.0 buyrate that the previous WrestleMania had achieved. The event received positive reviews from various websites and wrestling publications. In 2010, Rob McNew of 411mania gave the event an overall score of 9.0 out of 10.0 and noted that WrestleMania X may lack a lot of historical significance due to being during a relatively down time for business, but this show kicked all kinds of ass. He further noted that Bret Owen and Razor Shawn were both coin flip choices for not only match of the year, but match of the decade as well. He concluded the review citing how WrestleMania X was easily one of the top five Wrestlemanias ever. Much of the praise towards the event was aimed at the ladder match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon. McNew of 411mania cited the match as downright groundbreaking for the time and an amazing match that put the ladder match on the map. It was one of the few matches in North America to receive a five star rating from Dave Meltzer and also to be voted Match of the Year 1994 by readers of his Wrestling Observer Newsletter publication. Pro Wrestling Illustrated readers also named that match PWI Match of the Year 1994 . It was placed 3 on IGN's Top 20 Matches in Wrestlemania History and described as one of the most ground breaking matches in wrestling history . The opening match between Owen Hart and Bret Hart has also garnered acclaim. McNew described as the best opening match in professional wrestling history . It was also 4 on the list of IGN's Top 20 Matches in Wrestlemania History writer Jon Robinson described it as the best opening match in pay per view history. Multi time world champion Chris Jericho stated For me, the best match on was always Bret vs. Owen, and it kicked off the show and it was hard to follow...the story was amazing, it was kind of Owen's coronation it was a great moment . Men on a Mission continued to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts. Men on a Mission won the title on March 29, 1994. This is said to have been an unplanned title change, as Mabel accidentally fell on Pierre to get the pinfall. This title reign lasted only two days, however, as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch. Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect were scheduled to face each other in a series of matches on the WrestleMania Revenge Tour. Mr. Perfect was replaced by Crush, however, and Mr. Perfect did not appear again in the WWF until Survivor Series 1995. Adam Bomb and Earthquake had a rematch on the April 4, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, which Earthquake won. The feud did not progress any further, as Earthquake left the WWF for World Championship Wrestling WCW in May 1994. Wippleman and Finkel wrestled a series of Tuxedo matches in 1994 that culminated in a match on the January 9, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw. Finkel defeated Wippleman in a final Tuxedo match to end the feud. A few weeks after the match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon, Diesel begin to challenge Ramon for the Intercontinental championship. Michaels helped Diesel defeat Ramon for the title on April 13, 1994. This win began a push for Diesel that saw him win the WWF's Triple Crown Championship in one calendar year. The ten man tag team match took place on the April 4, 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw. The heel team won, as Irwin R. Schyster pinned the 123 Kid to win the match. Bret and Owen Hart continued their feud throughout 1994. At King of the Ring, their real life brother in law and Bret's former tag team partner Jim Neidhart became involved in the angle by helping Owen win the tournament. During the coronation ceremony, Owen announced that he wanted to be referred to as the King of Harts . At SummerSlam, Bret successfully defended his title against Owen in a Steel cage match but was attacked after the match by Owen and Neidhart, prompting another brother in law, Davey Boy Smith, to get involved on Bret's side. At Survivor Series, the storyline saw Owen partially responsible for costing Bret the WWF Championship. Bret faced Bob Backlund in a match with the stipulation that the winner would be declared when a competitor's cornerman threw a towel into the ring to signify a submission. After Owen caused Smith to knock himself unconscious, Owen pretended to feel sympathy for Bret. While Backlund had Bret in a crossface Chickenwing, the angle had Owen convince his mother Helen to throw in Bret's towel, enabling Backlund to win the match and the title. After the match, Owen celebrated with Backlund and showed that he was faking the concern for his brother.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20X
"WrestleMania XI was the 11th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event, produced by the World Wrestling Federation WWF at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut on April 2, 1995. The main event was a match between NFL linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who faced Bam Bam Bigelow as the result of an argument that took place between the two at the 1995 Royal Rumble. Taylor won the match, which led to Bigelow being kicked out of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. Shawn Michaels faced WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel in a title match but was unable to win the championship. Jeff Jarrett retained his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Razor Ramon. Owen Hart and his mystery partner, Yokozuna, challenged The Smoking Gunns for the WWF Tag Team Championship and won the title belts. The match between Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF mainstream press coverage. The reactions to the match were mixed some people thought that Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF. Special Olympian Kathy Huey sang a rendition of America the Beautiful during the event, replacing the previously advertised band, Fishbone. Prior to Lawrence Taylor's match against Bam Bam Bigelow, Salt n Pepa sang Whatta Man. Several other celebrities also had roles at WrestleMania. Nicholas Turturro, one of the stars of NYPD Blue, conducted interviews and served as a guest ring announcer. Jonathan Taylor Thomas of Home Improvement was a guest timekeeper for the match between Diesel and Shawn Michaels. On September 30, 1995, a one hour special including the Diesel vs. Shawn Michaels match and the Lawrence Taylor vs. Bam Bam Bigelow match was broadcast on the FOX Network. At the WrestleMania weekend, the WWF also held its Fan Fest, a promotional event during which wrestlers interacted with fans and signed autographs. The WWF released the event on VHS in North America in 1995. The VHS version was then re released on March 2, 1999. The event was also released on DVD in North America as part of the WrestleMania Complete Anthology boxed set on November 1, 2005. In the United Kingdom, the event was released on VHS on July 10, 1995. Packaged together with WrestleMania XII, it was then released on DVD in the United Kingdom as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line on August 7, 2006. The most heavily promoted feud going into the event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. At Royal Rumble 1995, Bigelow teamed with Tatanka in the final round of a tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bigelow was pinned at the end of the match, which led to the crowd heckling him. He responded by pushing NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was sitting at ringside. Bigelow refused to apologize and instead challenged Taylor to a wrestling match. Taylor agreed and trained with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel to prepare for the match. The storyline between Bigelow and Taylor brought the WWF much mainstream exposure, as the match was discussed by several news outlets. The other main event at WrestleMania was a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship between Diesel and Shawn Michaels. Diesel had originally entered the WWF as Michaels's bodyguard but later began wrestling and forming a tag team with Michaels. The pair held the WWF Tag Team Championship together in 1994. At Survivor Series 1994, however, Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel in the face. This led to an argument during which Diesel dissolved the tag team and vacated the championship. Three days later, Diesel defeated Bob Backlund to become the new WWF Champion. At Royal Rumble 1995, Michaels won the battle royal main event, which earned him a match against Diesel for the title belt at WrestleMania. The WWF Intercontinental Championship was also defended at WrestleMania. Jeff Jarrett, the champion, had been feuding with Razor Ramon, the challenger, for several months. At Royal Rumble 1995, Jarrett was accompanied by The Roadie, who interfered on Jarrett's behalf and helped Jarrett win the championship. To even the sides in the rematch at WrestleMania, Ramon was accompanied by his friend, the 123 Kid. In a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, The Smoking Gunns defended their title. Their opponents were Owen Hart and a mystery partner. Hart refused to tell anyone the name of his partner, which left the Gunns uncertain who they would be facing and led to much speculation about the identity of the mystery partner. Bret Hart faced Bob Backlund in an I Quit match at WrestleMania. The feud began the previous summer, when Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Backlund. Backlund mistakenly thought he won the match and began celebrating, but Hart pinned him to retain the title. After the match, Backlund turned heel by attacking Hart. This led to a title match at Survivor Series 1994, in which Backlund won the title from Hart. Although Backlund soon lost the belt, the feud continued and Backlund attacked Hart during Hart's match at Royal Rumble 1995. Also at Royal Rumble 1995, The Undertaker faced Irwin R. Schyster as part of The Undertaker's feud with Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During the match, King Kong Bundy, another Corporation member, interfered and enabled the Corporation to steal The Undertaker's urn, which was said to be the source of his power. In the opening match, The Allied Powers Davey Boy Smith and Lex Luger faced the Blu Brothers Eli Blu and Jacob Blu . Smith started out on the offensive, but Jacob gained control with a running bulldog throw. The Blus capitalized on the fact that they are identical twins by switching places while the referee was not looking. Luger came into the match near the end and performed a running forearm smash on Eli. Jacob tried to throw Luger with a powerbomb, but Luger tagged in Smith, who performed a sunset flip to pin Jacob and win the match. The second match pitted Razor Ramon, with the 123 Kid in his corner, against WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett, who had The Roadie in his corner. Ramon took control at the beginning of the match by using power moves against Jarrett. Jarrett tried to leave the match, but the 123 Kid forced him back into the ring. Jarrett took advantage of one of Ramon's mistakes to gain the advantage. He applied a sleeper hold on Ramon, who used his strength advantage to escape the move. After Ramon threw Jarrett, the Kid attempted to interfere but was kicked by Jarrett. Ramon jumped off the ropes to attack Jarrett, but Jarrett avoided the move and applied a figure four leglock on Ramon. Ramon reversed the move to place the pressure on Jarrett's legs. He then threw Jarrett to the mat with a suplex from the second rope and prepared to execute the Razor's Edge, his finishing move. The Roadie entered the ring and attacked Ramon, prompting the referee to disqualify Jarrett because titles cannot change hands on a disqualification, Jarrett retained his championship. In the next match, The Undertaker faced King Kong Bundy. Ted DiBiase was at ringside holding the urn that his wrestlers had stolen from The Undertaker. Larry Young, a legit American League umpire, was the special referee for the match. Young's storyline was as an out of work sports official because of the recently ended MLB Players Association strike and a lockout of the Major League Umpires Association umpires which led to the eventual dissolution of the MLUA in 2000 prior to the new union, umpires were split by league . The Undertaker took control at the beginning of the match by jumping off the top rope and hitting Bundy. He then performed several clothesline attacks on Bundy. Bundy responded with a clothesline that knocked The Undertaker out of the ring. Seeing DiBiase close, The Undertaker took back his urn. After The Undertaker returned to the ring, DiBiase called Kama, another Corporation member, to the ring. Kama stole the urn, and Bundy attacked The Undertaker in order to let Kama escape backstage. Bundy picked The Undertaker up and powerslammed him to the mat. He then performed an Avalanche splash to squish The Undertaker against the corner of the ring. The Undertaker was unharmed, however, and performed a powerslam and a clothesline on Bundy before pinning him to win the match. The Smoking Gunns defended their WWF Tag Team Championship in the next match against Owen Hart and his mystery partner, who was revealed to be Yokozuna. The Gunns worked together to control the match at the beginning, but Yokozuna gained control by performing a leg drop on Billy Gunn. Hart attempted to perform a dropkick from the top rope but accidentally hit Yokozuna. The Gunns briefly took control until Yokozuna performed a belly to belly suplex and landed on Billy. He then performed a Banzai Drop, jumping from the second rope and sitting on Billy's chest. Hart tagged in and considered performing the Sharpshooter submission hold instead, he pinned Billy Gunn to win the title belts for his team. The next match, an I Quit match, took place between Bret Hart and Bob Backlund, with Roddy Piper as the guest referee. It was explained that, in order to win the match, a wrestler must force his opponent to say I quit into a microphone held by Piper. Hart attempted to perform the Sharpshooter early in the match when Backlund blocked it, Hart executed a figure four leglock instead. Backlund escaped the hold and began trying to injure Hart's arm with an armbar hold. Hart then tried to attack Backlund in the corner of the ring, but Backlund moved and Hart hit his shoulder against the ring post. Backlund tried to perform the crossface chickenwing, his signature submission hold. Hart blocked him and performed the same hold on Backlund instead. Backlund made an unintelligible sound into the microphone, and Piper determined that he had submitted. As a result, the win was awarded to Bret Hart. In the next match, which was for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, challenger Shawn Michaels was accompanied to the ring by Jenny McCarthy and Diesel, the champion, was escorted by Pamela Anderson. Michaels relied on his quickness in the opening stages, while Diesel used his strength advantage against Michaels. Diesel threw Michaels out of the ring and onto the arena floor, but Michaels later performed a clothesline that knocked Diesel out of the ring. Michaels capitalized on his advantage by performing several aerial moves, including a flying crossbody, flying bulldog throw, and a diving elbow drop. He was unable to pin Diesel, however, so he performed a sleeper hold to wear Diesel down. They brawled outside the ring, after which Michaels performed a superkick, his finishing move, but Sid, Michaels's bodyguard, had the referee distracted and unable to count the pinfall. Diesel recovered and controlled the remainder of the match with power moves before throwing Michaels to the mat with a botched Jackknife powerbomb and getting the pinfall victory. The final bout of the event was the main event match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. Bigelow was accompanied by the members of DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation King Kong Bundy, Tatanka, Irwin R. Schyster, Kama, and Nikolai Volkoff. To prevent the Corporation members from interfering, Taylor brought several football players Ken Norton Jr., Chris Spielman, Rickey Jackson, Carl Banks, Reggie White, and Steve McMichael. Taylor gained the advantage early and performed a clothesline that knocked Bigelow out of the ring. Once he returned to the ring, Bigelow took control of the match by kicking Taylor repeatedly and performing a Boston crab submission hold to hurt Taylor's back. Taylor got out of the hold and threw Bigelow with a suplex. Bigelow recovered and performed several headbutts on Taylor before executing a moonsault flip to knock Taylor down to the mat. Taylor began to take control of the match again, but Bigelow kicked him in the back of the head and then performed a headbutt from the top rope. Bigelow was unable to pin Taylor, however. Taylor climbed to the second rope, jumped off, and used his forearm to hit Bigelow. He then covered Bigelow to win the match. The event was attended by 15,000 fans, who paid a total of 750,000 in admission fees. This was down from the previous year's attendance of 18,065, but the decline could be attributed to the smaller size of the venue for WrestleMania XI. The attendance figure was also lower than the following year's figure of 18,852 fans at WrestleMania XII. The pay per view buyrate for WrestleMania XI was 1.3, which was lower than the 1.68 buyrate for WrestleMania X but higher than the 1.2 buyrate for WrestleMania XII. Writing for 411mania, columnist Dustin James rated the event as the seventeenth best of the first twenty three WrestleManias. He stated that the event did not have any truly amazing matches but that Lawrence Taylor put on a solid performance. John Powell of SLAM Wrestling rated the event as the worst WrestleMania of all time. The specific concerns he mentioned in his review are Diesel's championship reign and WWF allowing a football player to defeat a wrestler in what he describes as a sham of a match . In contrast, Pro Wrestling Illustrated columnist Dave Rosenbaum stated that WrestleMania saved the WWF in its feud with rival World Championship Wrestling. He argued that Taylor looked like a pro and contributed to an incredible match. He also observed that the tag team matches helped rejuvenate an area of wrestling that had been suffering in the WWF and that the match between Michaels and Diesel was a candidate for match of the year. Bret Hart was critical about his match against Bob Backlund, claiming it was probably my worst pay per view match I ever had . Shortly after WrestleMania, Diesel offered Shawn Michaels a rematch. Michaels blamed Sid for the loss and informed him that he would not be needed during the match. Sid got angry and attacked Michaels until Diesel saved him. Diesel and Michaels became allies once again, and they teamed up to win the WWF Tag Team Championship later that year. Diesel feuded with Sid and defeated him at the In Your House 1 and In Your House 2 pay per view events. The animosity lingered between Michaels and Sid, but they did not face each other to settle the feud until the September 11, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw. Bam Bam Bigelow was embarrassed after losing to Lawrence Taylor. To redeem himself, he challenged Diesel to a match for the WWF Championship. During the match, Tatanka turned on Bigelow and caused him to get pinned. Bigelow was kicked out of the Million Dollar Corporation and attacked by DiBiase's wrestlers. Diesel saved Bigelow from the attack, which led to a friendship being formed between the two. Bigelow defeated Tatanka in a dark match at In Your House 2. At King of the Ring 1995, Sid, DiBiase's latest addition to the Corporation, teamed with Tatanka in a loss to the team of Diesel and Bigelow. Razor Ramon and the 123 Kid were scheduled to face Jeff Jarrett and The Roadie at In Your House 1 the month after WrestleMania. The Kid sustained a legit injury, however, and was unable to compete. As a result, Ramon wrestled a two on one handicap match against Jarrett and The Roadie instead. Ramon won the bout, but the feud continued. At In Your House 2, The Roadie faced the 123 Kid and defeated him. Ramon and Jarrett wrestled several times, and Ramon regained the Intercontinental Championship on May 19, 1995. He held the belt for three days before dropping it back to Jarrett. After WrestleMania, Kama melted down The Undertaker's urn and made it into a necklace. The Undertaker defeated Kama in a dark match at In Your House 1, and again in a casket match at In Your House 2. He then won another casket match against Kama at SummerSlam 1995 to end the feud. The Smoking Gunns were given a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship at In Your House 1. Hart pinned Bart Gunn to retain the championship for his team. Hart and Yokozuna then moved on to face other competition, and the Gunns did not become serious contenders for the title again until late in 1995, when they defeated Hart and Yokozuna to regain the championship. Steve McMichael, who accompanied Lawrence Taylor, joined World Championship Wrestling later in 1995 as a color commentator then eventually as an in ring performer, joining the famous Four Horseman when he turned on and betrayed his tag team partner and former NFL star Kevin Greene at The Great American Bash '96 near the end of their tag team match against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson. Going by the name Mongo McMichael, he eventually went on to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20XI
"WrestleMania XXIV was the 24th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view PPV event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment WWE . The event took place on March 30, 2008, at the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida and was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Florida. WrestleMania XXIV was the second WrestleMania to be held outdoors, with the first being WrestleMania IX, held in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nine professional wrestling matches were scheduled for the event, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The first of these matches was a singles match from the ECW brand, in which Kane defeated ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW title. The second was a Triple threat match from the Raw brand, in which WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated challengers Triple H and John Cena to retain the championship. In the final match of the event, The Undertaker defeated SmackDown's World Heavyweight Champion Edge to win the title. From the six scheduled bouts on the undercard, three received more promotion than the others. In a No Disqualification match, boxing champion Floyd Money Mayweather defeated Big Show. The other featured undercard matches saw CM Punk win an interpromotional Money in the Bank ladder match and a retirement match in which Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair, leading to Flair's departure from the WWE and a period of retirement from active wrestling. Tickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 3, 2007. WWE and the City of Orlando hosted festivities that spanned a five day period within the central Florida region. For the second consecutive year, WrestleMania broke the record for the highest grossing pay per view in WWE history. It also set a gate record for the Citrus Bowl, grossing US 5.85 million in ticket sales. According to a study by Enigma Research Corporation of Toronto, the Citrus Bowl's record breaking attendance brought an estimated 51.5 million surpassing the projected 25 million into the local economy and generated 1.8 million in local tax revenue. The Central Florida Sports Commission reported that the event created jobs and brought approximately 60,000 visitors to the city. Over one million people ordered the event on pay per view, grossing 23.8 million in revenue. On March 21, 2007, a press conference was held at City Hall in Orlando, Florida, formally announcing the event for Orlando at the Citrus Bowl. According to an interview with The Daytona Beach News Journal at the press conference, WWE chairman Vince McMahon mentioned Orlando being one of three front runners to host the event, the other two being Las Vegas and Paris. McMahon explained that Orlando was chosen as geographically, a WrestleMania was never held in the southeast before. As the second WrestleMania to be held entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also announced that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, as well as the sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show. The set design for the entrance stage was at the north end of the stadium and consisted of another steel structure with various video screens hanging from it. The steel beams for the structure were custom built in Belgium and shipped over to Orlando. According to WWE Magazine, the amount of pyrotechnics used would be ten times that of the amount used on Raw. Without the restriction of a roof, the pyrotechnics for the show shot as high as 2,000 feet 610 m as compared to WrestleMania 23's height of 150 feet 46 m . The fireworks were set off from boats on one of the lakes nearby the stadium. WWE has been said to have spent an estimated 300,000 on the fireworks alone. With the Citrus Bowl's locker rooms on the south side and the entrance set on the north side, a tented 40,000 square feet 3,700 m2 mini city outside the north end served as the show's backstage area and included air conditioning, trailers, VIP areas, showers and restrooms. As a consequence, the road next to the north end zone, W. Church Street, was closed down until a day after the event. Numerous other roads were also closed to allow trucks and fork lifts to move in mega equipment for the event. The ring itself was built on the 50 yard line of the Citrus Bowl to give the best view for fans. Heavy duty plastic flooring had been put over the field, to protect the turf, provide seating, and serve as the steel structures' foundation. Development on the set design began in the middle of 2007. The building of the actual set began in the middle of March 2008. 100 people worked 16 hours a day to construct the set for the event. The construction finished on March 29. WrestleMania XXIV was the first WrestleMania event to be filmed in high definition. It was also the first WWE show and sports related title to be released on the Blu ray Disc format by WWE Home Video. WrestleMania also led to an increase in sales for musical artists related to the event, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers' album Stadium Arcadium, John Legend's album Live from Philadelphia, Rev Theory's single Light It Up , and Fuel's single Leave the Memories Alone , which was used as part of a tribute to Ric Flair. WrestleMania XXIV featured nine professional wrestling matches with wrestlers involved in pre existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to either the Raw, SmackDown, or ECW brand storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs. The predominant rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay per view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy at the same event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided to challenge him at No Way Out. In the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would be added to the WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton. The predominant rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge and The Undertaker, over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 1 episode of SmackDown, Assistant General Manager Theodore Long announced that at No Way Out, an Elimination Chamber match would be held to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. The Undertaker won the match by last eliminating Batista. On the following episode of SmackDown, Edge predicted that The Undertaker's 150 undefeated streak at WrestleMania would come to an end once he defeated him. Two weeks later, on the March 7 episode of SmackDown, the team of Edge and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap match, in which one wrestler faces a team of two or more wrestlers, after Edge pinned The Undertaker following a takedown variation called the spear. The following week, Edge, Hawkins, Ryder, and Chavo Guerrero, a group of aligned wrestlers, defeated Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels in a Steel Cage match, where the ring was surrounded by walls of steel. During the match, Undertaker interfered and attacked Hawkins, Ryder, and Guerrero. The Undertaker used a Double chokeslam on Hawkins and Ryder and a Tombstone Piledriver on Guerrero. As Undertaker was attacking Guerrero, however, Edge escaped the cage and won the match for his team. The next week on SmackDown, Edge, along with Vickie Guerrero, Hawkins, and Ryder, held a mock burial, entitled Burial of The Undertaker's WrestleMania Undefeated Streak , to celebrate Edge's early victory over The Undertaker. During the burial , however, The Undertaker emerged from a casket, which was inside the ring, and attacked Edge, Hawkins, and Ryder, knocking Hawkins and Ryder outside the ring and chokeslamming Edge through the casket. At No Way Out, Big Show made a return to the company after taking time off for injuries beginning in December 2006. In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd Money Mayweather, who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show dropped to his knees, Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on Raw, Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Show that at WrestleMania, I'm going to break your jaw . At their weigh in for their WrestleMania match, Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size. On the February 25 episode of Raw, 2008 WWE Hall of Fame Inductee Ric Flair challenged Shawn Michaels to a match at WrestleMania. Michaels accepted after some reluctance, knowing that due to a previous announcement from WWE chairman Mr. McMahon the next match Flair lost would result in his forced retirement. Flair said that it would be an honor for to retire at the hands of Shawn Michaels. On February 18, WWE announced via its website that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match would take place at WrestleMania XXIV, a match where the objective is to retrieve a briefcase suspended in the air using a ladder. The match involved wrestlers from all three WWE brands. The winner would earn a contract to challenge for any of the three WWE World Championships the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship of ECW at any time and any place over a one year period. Qualifying matches occurred to determine the participants in the match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's Raw with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of SmackDown. During the next two weeks on Raw, Chris Jericho defeated Jeff Hardy, and Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify. At a non televised SmackDown ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble. On the March 11 episode of ECW, CM Punk became the seventh entrant when he defeated Big Daddy V. John Morrison was the final person to qualify when he beat The Miz on the March 14 episode of SmackDown. Jeff Hardy was later removed from the match after a legitimate suspension by WWE for a drug violation of the company's Wellness Policy. WWE decided not to add another superstar in his place, making that year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to have seven participants. Before the show aired live on pay per view, Kane won a 24 man Interpromotional Battle Royal, an elimination style match where the last person remaining was the winner, to win an ECW Championship match against Chavo Guerrero later that night. The event officially began with John Legend singing a rendition of America the Beautiful . The first match was a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and John Bradshaw Layfield JBL , a match in which there were no disqualifications or countouts and the match outcomes could have occurred anywhere. Finlay was accompanied to the ring by his storyline son, Hornswoggle, who was returning from a scripted injury suffered at the hands of JBL. During the match, JBL hit Finlay with a trash can lid when the latter was about to perform a suicide dive on him through the ropes on the outside. Later on, Finlay tossed JBL through a table that he had set up earlier on the turnbuckle. Hornswoggle also got involved during the match by hitting JBL with a kendo stick, while later on JBL threw a trash can at him. Attacking Finlay's knee with a kendo stick, JBL delivered a Clothesline from Hell to Finlay to score a successful pinfall. This was an interpromotional match. The next match of the evening was the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no disqualifications or countouts, and the only way to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand and Montel Vontavious Porter M.V.P. from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury , entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the ladder, and delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring ropes groin first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match. Next after that match, Howard Finkel introduced the 2008 WWE Hall of Fame class Jack and Gerald Brisco, Gordon Solie represented by his family , Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia represented by his wife Lia and daughter Ata , Eddie Graham represented by his son Mike , Mae Young, and Ric Flair represented by his family . The next match, which was billed as a Battle for Brand Supremacy , was between SmackDown's Batista and Raw's Umaga. Early in the match, both Batista and Umaga exchanged blows and Batista knocked Umaga outside with a shoulder block. Umaga later kicked Batista in the face, which caused him to fall back first outside the ring from the ring apron. As a result, Umaga started targeting Batista's injured back. In the end, however, when Umaga tried to perform his Samoan Spike, Batista countered the attempt and gave him a spinebuster. Batista won the match by pinning Umaga after a Batista Bomb. The fourth match for the event featured Chavo Guerrero defending his ECW Championship against Kane. Kane surprised Chavo by emerging from underneath the ring instead of from the entrance stage during his ring entrance. Kane instantly pinned Chavo after a chokeslam and won the ECW Championship in eleven seconds. This was the only ECW match on the show. Ric Flair's Career Threatening match against Shawn Michaels was next, which stipulated that Flair would have to retire from wrestling if he had lost. At the start of the match, both superstars engaged in a series of counters, and then Flair shoved Michaels in a corner, making Old Yeller comments to him. In retaliation, Michaels slapped Flair in the face, which caused him to start bleeding from the mouth. Later, Michaels attempted Sweet Chin Music, but stopped in the process and Flair capitalized by trapping him in his figure four leglock. Afterward, Michaels finally delivered the Sweet Chin Music to Flair for a near fall. Michaels then trapped Flair in his modified figure four leglock, but Flair delivered a thumb to the eye to Michaels to break the submission. As Flair was delivering chops to Michaels' chest, Michaels executed a second Sweet Chin Music. After getting up on his feet with a worried face, Michaels said to Flair I'm sorry, I love you , before nailing a final Sweet Chin Music and thus pinning Flair to end his 35 year long wrestling career. After the match, Michaels left quickly and Flair got a standing ovation from the crowd. An emotional Flair embraced his family at ringside and then, as he proceeded to go backstage, he thanked the crowd for their support. The sixth match was the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match, in which Maria and Ashley faced Beth Phoenix and Melina, who were accompanied to the ring by Santino Marella. Rapper Snoop Dogg served as the official Master of Ceremonies for the match. In the match, several WWE Divas surrounded the ring and were able to interfere in the match without disqualifications. Due to some technical difficulties, the lights at Citrus Bowl temporarily went out during the match. Near the end, a pin attempt by Maria was prevented when Marella pulled Maria's leg. In response, Raw commentator Jerry Lawler approached and knocked Marella down with a punch. Phoenix executed a Fisherman Suplex and pinned Maria to win the match. After the match, Snoop Dogg executed a Clothesline on Marella and kissed Maria, before leaving with her and Ashley. Next was Randy Orton defending his WWE Championship against Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match, which is a standard match involving three wrestlers with no disqualifications. For his entrance, Cena had the Jones High School Marching Tigers marching band perform an instrumental version of his theme song The Time Is Now live. During the match, when Triple H had held Orton in a sleeper hold, Cena picked up both Orton and Triple H for an FU, but Triple H dropped down and low blowed him. Orton then dominated the match for some time one highlight of the match featured Orton performing a crossbody from the top rope on Cena, while the latter was held on Triple H's shoulders in a seating position. Orton also performed an DDT to both Cena and Triple H simultaneously. Orton then tried to perform an RKO on Cena, but he countered and threw Orton onto Triple H. Triple H then started targeting Orton's legs and using some submissions on him. The match came to an end when Cena had Triple H on his shoulders for the FU, but was countered into a Pedigree. As Triple H was in the pin, Orton punted Triple H and pinned Cena to win the match and retain the WWE Championship. The next match was the No Disqualification match between Big Show and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Early in the match, Mayweather repeatedly escaped Big Show's grasp and delivered body shots to him. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to walk out of the match, but Big Show walked up the ramp and brought Mayweather back in the ring. As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times on the head with it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and put on a pair of brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. As a result, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner. The main event of the night saw Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against The Undertaker. The early going of the match was slow paced, in which both superstars countered each other's maneuvers. During the match, Undertaker ran and leapt over the top rope from the ring onto Edge on the outside. Then throughout the match, Edge was able to counter Undertaker's numerous signature moves, including the Chokeslam, Old School and the Last Ride, a variation of the powerbomb. Near the end, Edge hit Undertaker with a television camera while the referee was knocked down. When he proceeded to deliver a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker, Undertaker countered it into his own version and successfully delivered it to Edge for a two count. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came to the ring for Edge's aid, but Undertaker took them out. Because of their distraction, Edge was able to execute a spear on Undertaker, but was unable to pin him. When Edge delivered another spear to Undertaker, Undertaker applied Hell's Gate and forced Edge to submit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, improving his WrestleMania record to 160. After the show, WWE was criticized for a malfunction in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but the results of the investigation were never released. On the following episode of Raw, Ric Flair made his farewell speech, which led to Triple H introducing various people from Flair's past, such as the Four Horsemen, Ricky Steamboat, and others, each coming out to give an emotional farewell. Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out to say thank you to Flair Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance . Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protege Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' selfishness at WrestleMania for not lying down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, WWE's next scheduled pay per view event, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick. The feud between Randy Orton, John Cena and Triple H continued after WrestleMania with the added involvement of John Bradshaw Layfield leading to a Fatal Four Way Elimination match between all four at Backlash, an elimination style match where the last person remaining is the winner. At the event, Triple H won his seventh WWE Championship by last pinning Orton. With Matt Hardy's return at WrestleMania, his feud with Montel Vontavious Porter over the WWE United States Championship, that had started in July 2007, was revived with a match booked at Backlash, which Hardy won. The rivalries between The Undertaker and Edge and the one between Kane and Chavo Guerrero both continued with successful title defenses at Backlash. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, General Manager Vickie Guerrero stripped The Undertaker of the World Heavyweight Championship because of his continued use of his illegal chokehold, claiming she did it to protect the other wrestlers. Approximately 1,058,000 people ordered WrestleMania XXIV, grossing 23.8 million in revenue. This number was fewer than the 1,188,000 buys that WrestleMania 23 achieved.

"WrestleMania XXX also written as WrestleMania 30 was the 30th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view event and WWE Network event produced by WWE. It took place on April 6, 2014, at the Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the first WWE event simultaneously broadcast live on pay per view television and WWE's new streaming media service, the WWE Network. Seven professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card and one pre show match was streamed on the WWE Network. Daniel Bryan defeated Triple H in the first match on the main show to qualify for the triple threat main event match, where he defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton to become the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion. The event was also notable for The Undertaker's 210 undefeated streak at WrestleMania coming to an end with a loss to Brock Lesnar. The WWE Divas Championship was the other title defended on the main show, its only defense at WrestleMania, while the WWE Tag Team Championship was defended on the pre show. WWE claimed 10.9 million in ticket revenue for WrestleMania XXX and estimated a 142.2 million economic impact on New Orleans. The event has received highly positive reviews. SLAM Wrestling rated the show a 4.5 out of 5, while the Pro Wrestling Torch rated the event 8.75 out of 10 and The Times Picayune described it as spectacular . WrestleMania is considered WWE's flagship event, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. On February 18, 2013, WWE announced that WrestleMania XXX would be held at the Mercedes Benz Superdome in the city of New Orleans on April 6, 2014. The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30. On August 12, travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale, which included tickets to WrestleMania, hotel room accommodation, and other activities including WrestleMania Axxess, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, and the next Raw the cheapest package cost 795 per person. On November 16, individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster, with prices ranging from 25 to 850. While ordering WrestleMania through pay per view television costs between 55 70, WWE has also made WrestleMania XXX available live through its new WWE Network online streaming service, which costs 9.99 per month with a six month contract WrestleMania was the first event available simultaneously on pay per view and on the WWE Network. The event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana. There are three official theme songs for the event, Celebrate by Kid Rock, Legacy by Eminem, and In Time by Mark Collie. A promotional poster for the event was released through pay per view providers such as In Demand, with the tagline laissez les bons temps rouler. The WrestleMania set was built by a crew of roughly 400 workers over two weeks, assembling equipment carried by 85 semi trailer trucks. After the Royal Rumble event in late January 2014, CM Punk reportedly legitimately walked out on WWE while still under contract and WWE stopped promoting him for future events which Pro Wrestling Torch editor Wade Keller analysed as playing a part in Daniel Bryan's WrestleMania journey. In May 2014, Bryan revealed in an interview that he also believed that WWE decided to give him the big WrestleMania spotlight only after Punk quit. Daniel Bryan entered the event as the bookmakers' favorite to walk out of WrestleMania as champion, while the biggest favorite to earn a victory was the Undertaker, which Forbes endorsed as as close to a sure thing as you're going to find . The card consisted of eight matches, including one on the preshow, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers. Storylines between the characters played out on WWE's primary television programs, Raw and SmackDown. Dave Scherer of PWInsider.com's analysis of Daniel Bryan's feud with the Authority Daniel Bryan's eight month road to WrestleMania began at SummerSlam in August 2013, when he started feuding with Triple H and Randy Orton. Since June, Bryan had been praised as one of the top performers in WWE by critics and veterans of the professional wrestling industry, as his rise in status led him to a title shot at SummerSlam. At the event, Bryan defeated John Cena to win his first WWE Championship with Triple H as the special guest referee. After the match, Triple H turned heel by attacking Bryan, which directly led to Orton using his Money in the Bank title opportunity for an immediate title shot. Orton pinned a downed Bryan to capture the WWE Championship. After SummerSlam, Triple H claimed that it was a business decision to sabotage Bryan because Bryan did not fit the type of wrestler that the company was looking for as its champion therefore, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon later known as the Authority instead endorsed Orton as the face of the WWE . Over the next few months, Bryan was constantly sabotaged in his attempts to gain and hold on to the WWE Championship. Bryan defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship at Night of Champions, but due to referee Scott Armstrong making a fast count, Triple H stripped Bryan of the title the next night on Raw. At Battleground, a match between Bryan and Orton for the vacant title ended in a no contest when Big Show who had been manipulated by the Authority in the weeks prior attacked both men. Bryan once again challenged Orton for the vacant championship at Hell in a Cell Triple H interfered in the match and was attacked by Bryan, resulting in special guest referee Shawn Michaels attacking Bryan, which led to Orton capturing the WWE Championship again. At TLC, WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena to unify the two titles into the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In January 2014, Batista returned to WWE after having left in May 2010, and promptly won the 2014 Royal Rumble match for a slot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Batista's win and Daniel Bryan's lack of participation in the Royal Rumble match was heavily booed by the live crowd at the event. At Elimination Chamber, Randy Orton successfully defended his championship in the Elimination Chamber match to set up Orton versus Batista who still received a negative fan reaction at Elimination Chamber when he defeated Alberto Del Rio for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXX. Daniel Bryan also participated in the Elimination Chamber match, but was the last wrestler eliminated due to interference by Director of Operations Kane, who was affiliated with the Authority. Frustrated over being constantly cost the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority, Bryan challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania XXX. When Triple H refused Bryan's challenge, Bryan brought a large group of fans on the March 10 episode of Raw to occupy the ring and refused to leave. An irate Triple H agreed to Bryan's demand for a WrestleMania match with the stipulation that if Bryan won, he would be inserted into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the event. On the March 17 episode of Raw, Triple H voiced his frustrations over Orton and Batista, then changed the stipulation of his own match, guaranteeing that the winner between him and Bryan would be added to the WWE World Heavyweight championship match, thus assuring a triple threat match for the title. On the February 24 episode of Raw, Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their complaints about Lesnar not being in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker's 210 undefeated streak at WrestleMania. At the Royal Rumble event, The Wyatt Family, led by Bray Wyatt, cost John Cena his match against Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At the Elimination Chamber event, the Wyatt Family attacked Cena during his Elimination Chamber match for the same championship, which directly led to Cena's elimination from the match. Wyatt was motivated by a desire to end this era of lies , beginning with Cena, because he wanted to expose to the world that Cena being an upholder of all that is moral and good and right was merely a hollow illusion. Proving that Cena was a fraud would ruin his legacy, but Wyatt wanted to take it one step further by turning Cena into a monster. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Cena issued Wyatt a challenge for a match at WrestleMania, which Wyatt accepted. The WrestleMania Kickoff pre show was split into two segments, each an hour long the first half could be watched for free on WWE.com, YouTube, and other social media outlets, while the second half which had the pre show match was only available on the WWE Network. Analysis was provided by a panel of Josh Mathews, Mick Foley, Booker T and Shawn Michaels joining midway were retired National Football League linebacker Shawne Merriman, Jimmy Hart, Alex Riley and Trish Stratus. Renee Young directed social media discussion, while Byron Saxton and Tom Phillips conducted backstage interviews. The pre show match was a fatal four way elimination tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso , RybAxel Ryback and Curtis Axel , Los Matadores Diego and Fernando , accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans Jack Swagger and Cesaro , accompanied by Zeb Colter. The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway. Five minutes into the match, Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature Neutralizer to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven minute mark. Later, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock. Colter demanded that they put their differences aside, but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off. The English commentators for the event were Michael Cole, John Bradshaw Layfield, and Jerry The King Lawler, while there were also Spanish and French commentators at ringside. Justin Roberts and Lilian Garcia acted as ring announcers. Charles Robinson and John Cone were noted to have refereed Triple H's and John Cena's matches respectively. During the event, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame inductees Jake The Snake Roberts, Mr. T, Paul Bearer represented by his real life sons , Carlos Colon, Lita, Razor Ramon and The Ultimate Warrior appeared before the live audience after being introduced by Howard Finkel. Two backstage segments included WWE veterans the first consisted of Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Sgt. Slaughter, Ricky Steamboat, The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase and Ron Simmons. The second consisted of the stars from WrestleMania I, with Hulk Hogan, Mr. T, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, Pat Patterson, and Mean Gene Okerlund appearing. Meanwhile, WWE Hall of Famers Bruno Sammartino, Harley Race, Bob Backlund, Dusty Rhodes, and Bret Hart were shown at ringside. The pay per view event started when host Hulk Hogan came down to the ring for a segment, at one point accidentally calling the Superdome the Silverdome . A few moments later, Stone Cold Steve Austin joined him in the ring, teasing a confrontation between the two. After that, The Rock also came down to the ring. The three reminisced about past WrestleManias and led the crowd in their signature chants and catchphrases. They then shared a number of beers together before departing the ring. In the first match on the pay per view portion of the show, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the apron. Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly to back suplex on the apron. Bryan refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes Lock , but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but Bryan kicked out at two. After another series of counters, Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped Bryan, distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage. Next, The New Age Outlaws Road Dogg and Billy Gunn and Kane faced The Shield Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns . The pace of the match was quick the end of the match saw Kane being hit by Reigns' signature spear, and Reigns then hit both Outlaws simultaneously with another spear. The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws for a decisive victory. After that, the battle royal for the Andre the Giant Memorial Trophy was next. Brodus Clay was eliminated by The Great Khali, followed by Khali himself by the three members of 3MB, who were all eliminated by Mark Henry, who was in turn eliminated by Big Show. Fandango eliminated WWE Intercontinental Champion Big E and showboated on the ring apron, so Sheamus delivered over 20 forearm clubs to Fandango's chest and eliminated him. Cesaro, an unannounced entrant who had wrestled on the pre show, eliminated Rey Mysterio with a European uppercut and then threw Kofi Kingston out of the ring, but Kingston survived because his feet landed on the ring steps. Kingston returned to the match but Sheamus later eliminated him. Alberto Del Rio, who had earlier eliminated Goldust and Cody Rhodes, eliminated Dolph Ziggler to leave himself, Sheamus, Cesaro and Big Show as the final four men. Del Rio and Sheamus eliminated each other, leaving Cesaro and Show to fight back and forth until Cesaro lifted Show and body slammed him out of the ring to become the victor, mirroring Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III. The next match was between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's entrance was voodoo themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena to be the monster that he is and to finish him off Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, but it was not enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing He's Got the Whole World in His Hands , so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan who had gotten on the ring apron with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win. In the next match, Brock Lesnar faced The Undertaker with Undertaker's streak of victories at WrestleMania on the line. The match was a slow one with Undertaker looking exhausted throughout. Lesnar survived a chokeslam while Undertaker did not succumb to Lesnar's signature F5 maneuver. Undertaker twice trapped Lesnar in his Hell's Gate submission, but both times Lesnar broke the hold by lifting Undertaker up and powerbombing him. Lesnar and Undertaker then traded locking each other in the kimura submission, but neither submitted. Lesnar then countered an Old School attempt by Undertaker into another F5, but Undertaker kicked out. With the Streak slipping away, a panicking Undertaker desperately responded with Last Ride powerbomb and a Tombstone Piledriver, but was left horrified when Lesnar kicked out at two. As Undertaker attempted a second Tombstone Piledriver, Lesnar countered into a third F5 and pinned Undertaker for the victory, ending the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania as Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman freaked out at the result. WWE did not play Lesnar's theme music immediately after his victory, highlighting the reaction of a shocked and stunned crowd, just before Justin Roberts announced Lesnar as the winner. Instead, WWE showed a graphic displaying the Undertaker's WrestleMania record of 21 1 . The crowd eventually booed Lesnar as he left. Undertaker was left in the ring, where he gathered himself. As he slowly walked up the entrance ramp, WWE's announcers gave him a standing ovation and the crowd chanted his name and various thank you chants. The penultimate match was the 14 Diva single fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship this marked the only time the title was defended at WrestleMania. The match started with the other wrestlers attacking champion AJ Lee and her bodyguard, Tamina Snuka. As the match progressed, Aksana met Naomi at the top rope and Natalya slipped under Aksana to perform a powerbomb superplex combination. Tamina pulled Aksana out of the ring to prevent Natalya from winning, so Natalya clotheslined Tamina on the outside but was prevented from re entering the ring due to AJ kicking her. AJ applied her signature Black Widow hold on Naomi and won the match, thus retaining her title. WWE reported that AJ won by moving Naomi's hand unto the mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted. In the main event of the night, Daniel Bryan, Batista and Randy Orton faced off in a triple threat match for Orton's WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Orton's entrance included a live performance by Rev Theory. Orton started by targeting Bryan's injured arm to momentarily neutralize him. With no count outs in a triple threat match, Batista and Orton battled at ringside Batista tried for his signature Batista Bomb onto the steel ring steps, but Orton countered with a back body drop onto the steps. After Orton and Batista returned to the ring, Bryan made a comeback with a missile dropkick to both men, then peppered his opponents' chests with roundhouse kicks. Bryan then served consecutive corner dropkicks to Orton and Batista, but then was suplexed from the ring to the outside by Batista. Batista and Orton fought again with Orton executing a superplex, but then Bryan immediately returned with a diving headbutt and applied his signature Yes Lock on Orton. With Orton trapped in Bryan's submission hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage and pulled the original referee out of the ring to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan. Armstrong made the count, but Bryan kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer, but Bryan snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match. Batista and Orton decided to work together to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan got off the stretcher and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton. Orton attempted to hit Bryan with an RKO but Bryan countered into a Yes Lock . Batista broke the hold but was instead trapped by Bryan in the Yes Lock , which Orton broke up. Batista avoided an RKO, then Orton leapfrogged Batista's spear so that Bryan received it and was sent out of the ring. Orton finally landed an RKO on Batista, who barely kicked out before three. Orton measured Batista for a punt kick, but instead received a signature running knee from Bryan. However, Batista threw Bryan out of the ring and covered Orton instead, which resulted in a near fall. A frustrated Batista followed up with a Batista Bomb on Orton, but Bryan came out of nowhere with a running knee on Batista. Bryan then trapped Batista in the Yes Lock Batista fought the hold but eventually had to submit, giving the victory and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship for Bryan. The show ended with Bryan's celebrations, including fireworks, confetti, pyrotechnics and Bryan leading the crowd people in a Yes chant. The event was a critical and commercial success. On the day of the event, WWE claimed that the event had drawn 10.9 million in ticket revenue at the Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans with an attendance figure of 75,167. WWE also claimed it was the fifth consecutive year that WrestleMania broke the host venue's highest grossing entertainment event record. Within a week of the event, WWE management and New Orleans city officials declared WrestleMania XXX to be a big success, with SMG general manager Alan Freeman declaring that New Orleans certainly would like to host the event again ... anything after 2018 is probably open at this point . WWE later claimed that WrestleMania XXX had a 142.2 million economic impact on New Orleans, generated 24.3 million in local taxes and that 79 of attendees were from outside of New Orleans. The figures were higher than those of the previous two WrestleManias. The day after the event, WWE revealed that the initial number of WWE Network subscribers was 667,287, therefore that was the maximum number of people who could have watched the event on the WWE Network. Bandwidth optimizing company Qwilt reported that Wrestlemania XXX led to WWE accounting for 6.5 of all online video traffic in North America on that day, ranking third below Netflix and YouTube but above Amazon, Hulu, and HBO. Wrestlemania XXX generated 20 times more traffic for the WWE Network than what the Network would have gained on a regular day at the time. On April 15, WWE announced nearly 400,000 domestic PPV buys for the event, while the previous year's WrestleMania before the existence of the WWE Network had earned 1,039,000 buys. In June 2014, WWE reported 690,000 total buys from both domestic and international sources. The Associated Press article on WrestleMania XXX focused on Hulk Hogan's hosting of the event, commenting that the Hulkster showed he can host, 30 years later. Hogan was overseeing the mayhem for 75,000 plus fans, and countless more watching on TV ... and what a scene it was , referring to Cesaro winning the Andre the Giant battle royal by heaving the sizeable Big Show over the top rope . Brock Lesnar's win over the Undertaker was simply described as the night's shocker . The Times Picayune reported on the event, with Daniel Bryan's win of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship win being profiled on the front page with the headline YES, INDEED . Gene Guillot of The Times Picayune also reviewed the event describing it as spectacular and that it delivered three memorable moments, one for each X . Regarding the setup, Guillot wrote that the set was magnificent, the pyro and lighting impeccable and the pageantry unparalleled . Guillot described the first moment which started the show as classic when the three biggest stars in the history of the business were in the same ring Hulk Hogan the biggest name , Stone Cold Steve Austin the biggest star and the Rock, the most successful . Next, Guillot wrote that the second indelible moment nearly stopped the show , describing the end of the Undertaker's Streak as the biggest surprise ending in WrestleMania historyand maybe even wrestling history . Finally, the third moment which closed the show was Bryan holding and hoisting in unison the two championships that represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while on his knees in the ring , which Guillot predicted will go down among the greatest moments in WrestleMania history . Nolan Howell of Slam Wrestling commented that WrestleMania XXX brings the beginning and end of eras . His star ratings out of 5 stars for each match are as follows for the pre show match, 1 2 for Bryan HHH, 1 2 for the Shield's match, 3 4 for the battle royal, for Cena Wyatt, for Undertaker Lesnar, 0.75 stars for the Divas' match and lastly 3 4 for the main event. Overall, he gave the event 4.5 out of 5 stars. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter summed up WrestleMania XXX as a very newsworthy show to say the least . Daniel Bryan's first match was described as a long technical one, and although Meltzer did not consider it a match of the year or probably even the week , it was the caliber of a good PPV main event . Triple H's post match attack on Bryan was said to be a very basic storyline but it's also exactly what they should have done . Bryan's second match in the main event was described as really great with lots of twists and turns, while the match result was again exactly what they should have done and the crowd reacted the way you would expect . Meltzer thought that the people just weren't into the Undertaker's match as nobody bought that Lesnar could win . Meanwhile, he felt that the Undertaker's departure was certainly teased like a retirement . For the battle royal, Meltzer noted the lack of surprise entrants such as Rob Van Dam, Alexander Rusev, Christian, or Wade Barrett. In other notes, Meltzer described the strong fan support for Cesaro and also labelled Cena's win as a genuine upset . Justin LaBar of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review summed up WrestleMania XXX as shocking , but one of the best . LaBar commented that he was bored with the Undertaker's match, just waiting for the final stretch as Undertaker was going to win anyway . When Lesnar won, LaBar said that he had never been part of a more real and emotionally driven moment . LaBar also commented that Antonio Cesaro is here to stay and described WWE as the ultimate puppet master because Daniel Bryan finally wins the world title and it still isn't the top story from that event. Benjamin Tucker of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter attended the event, and he scored the event 8.75 out of 10. He stated, that WrestleMania XXX served as an event meant to respect the past while looking forward to the future just like WrestleMania XX, with wrestlers like Bryan and Cesaro spotlighted as the future of WWE . However, Tucker noted that saying goodbye to the past proved harder than anyone could imagine with the end of the Undertaker's Streak. He said this, and not WrestleMania 28, was the true End of an Era but Tucker did not think it could have ended on a worse note with over 15 minutes of slow, subpar action . Tucker commented that the lack of hype before the event of the Streak being in jeopardy made it less of a defining moment when Lesnar broke it and more of an indictment on whoever okay'ed the decision to let this happen . However, Bryan was there to save the day with two well executed matches, making those in attendance momentarily forget about Taker and root for the underdog who was finally getting his chance to shine . Tucker praised the booking of the match as perfect with its numerous false finishes. For the rest of the event, Tucker commented that Wyatt lost nothing by losing, but Cena certainly lost a lot by winning. The man shows no weakness . Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan, Austin and the Rock was meaningless, surreal and a lot of fun . Tucker concluded by saying that the event was easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years and that the future certainly does look bright. If only we could have said our good byes properly . Reflecting in March 2016 just before WrestleMania 32, Luke Winkie of Sports Illustrated wrote that the WrestleMania XXX resulted in pure, cathartic, we have this moment forever joy . The Ultimate Warrior's first WrestleMania appearance since WrestleMania XII, headlining the unveiling of the 2014 Hall of Famers, would be his last. On April 8, the day after making his last public appearance on Raw to speak to the fans, Warrior suddenly collapsed and died at age 54 in Arizona. WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of Raw. WWE held an online charity auction centered around WrestleMania XXX from March 31 to April 8, 2014. It raised over 400,000 for the Boys Girls Clubs of America and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees's The Brees Dream Foundation . The Undertaker was reportedly taken away from the Superdome in an ambulance, which WWE later confirmed was due to him suffering a severe concussion he was discharged the next day. In May 2014, Shawn Michaels said that Vince McMahon made the final decision to end the Undertaker's streak about four hours before WrestleMania XXX. McMahon confirmed in December 2014 that it was indeed him who made the final decision and that the Undertaker was initially shocked at the decision. The decision was made due to McMahon believing that it would make a huge deal out of Brock Lesnar to set up the next WrestleMania event. McMahon also said that he did not foresee other viable candidates on the roster to fill Lesnar's role within the near future. During the post WrestleMania Raw on April 7, Triple H immediately used his authority as WWE COO to grant himself a title match against WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan later that night. As Stephanie McMahon tried to persuade Randy Orton, Batista, Kane, and the Shield to help Triple H in his title match, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H was the mastermind behind the attack on the Shield on the previous month's SmackDown. As a result, Bryan was attacked by Orton, Batista, and Kane just before his title match, which began anyway at the order of Triple H. However, the title match ended in a no contest and Bryan's retention when the Shield interfered, attacking and chasing away Triple H, Orton, Batista, and Kane. The following week, Triple H, Orton and Batista reformed Evolution to take on the Shield. Meanwhile, Stephanie McMahon enticed Kane to return to his masked self Kane complied and was granted a future title match against Bryan, and proceeded to carry out attacks against Bryan and his wife, Brie Bella. At the Extreme Rules pay per view, the Shield defeated Evolution while Bryan defeated Kane in an Extreme Rules match. John Cena continued to feud with Bray Wyatt over Wyatt capturing Cena's fanbase. At Extreme Rules, Wyatt defeated Cena in a steel cage match, after interference from the rest of the Wyatt Family and a demonic child. Cesaro was endorsed by Hulk Hogan on the post WrestleMania Raw, who presented him with the Andre the Giant battle royal trophy. Cesaro went on to reveal that he had a new manager in Paul Heyman, who would replace Zeb Colter. This earned Cesaro an attack from his former partner Jack Swagger, who destroyed Cesaro's trophy. Swagger later cost Cesaro his match against Rob Van Dam in the semi finals of the Intercontinental Championship 1 contender tournament, while Van Dam later lost in the tournament final due to Cesaro's interference. At Extreme Rules, Cesaro defeated Swagger and Van Dam in an elimination match. On the post WrestleMania Raw, as WWE Divas Champion AJ Lee celebrated her successful title defense at WrestleMania, NXT Women's Champion Paige made her main roster debut by congratulating AJ on her win. AJ reacted by slapping Paige and challenging her to an impromptu match with the Divas Championship on the line, resulting in Paige pulling out a quick victory to capture the title. Daniel Bryan announced on May 12 that due to injuries, he would require neck surgery, which he underwent on May 15. Bryan was stripped of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by the Authority on June 9 as he was not healthy enough to defend his championship. Due to his injury, Bryan was largely removed from WWE television. John Cena's feud with Bray Wyatt culminated with a Last Man Standing at Payback on June 1, where Cena buried Wyatt under multiple equipment cases to win the match and end the feud. Cena won Bryan's vacated WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank on June 29. Brock Lesnar returned on July 21 and proceeded to decisively defeat Cena at SummerSlam to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At Payback, the Shield ended their feud with Evolution by defeating them in a six man No Holds Barred elimination match. On the next Raw on June 2, Batista quit WWE in the storyline as Triple H, in wanting to continue the feud with the Shield, refused to grant Batista a one on one match for the WWE World Heavyweight title. Later that night, Seth Rollins turned on his Shield teammates and allied himself with Triple H's Authority, eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. The remaining members of the Shield, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, went their separate ways by the end of June. Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar's return. By that time, Cesaro had failed to win title matches for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the Intercontinental Championship and the United States Championship. At Night of Champions in September 2014, the Usos' tag title reign ended at the hands of Gold and Stardust. Also at the event, AJ Lee became a three time Divas Champion by capturing the title from Paige. Paige and AJ had exchanged the Divas Championship several times after WrestleMania, firstly on the June 30 episode of Raw and secondly at SummerSlam. In January 2015, Daniel Bryan returned to the ring having recovered from his injury. That month at the Royal Rumble event, Brock Lesnar retained his title in a triple threat match against John Cena and Seth Rollins the New Age Outlaws' return to the ring saw them lose to the Ascension, while Roman Reigns won the Royal Rumble match. The live audience booed Reigns' win and Bryan's early elimination from the match. In February, Reigns defeated Bryan at Fastlane to receive a WrestleMania main event title match against Lesnar, while Cesaro and Tyson Kidd won the Tag Team Championship from the Usos. At WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, the main event began as a singles match for champion Brock Lesnar against challenger Roman Reigns. More than ten minutes into the match, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to make it a triple threat match Rollins pinned Reigns shortly after to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other matches, Daniel Bryan wrestled in the pay per view opener, a seven man ladder match, and won the Intercontinental Championship from Bad News Barrett. Next, Rollins lost a singles match to Randy Orton. Then, Triple H defeated Sting in another singles match. A tag match followed where AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat Nikki Bella and Brie Bella. Next, Cena scored another WrestleMania victory, this time at the expense of Rusev, while Cena captured the United States Championship. In the penultimate match, the Undertaker in his return to TV defeated Bray Wyatt. On the pre show, Cesaro and Tyson Kidd successfully defended the tag titles, while Big Show won the second Andre the Giant memorial battle royal. The Undertaker reignited his feud with Brock Lesnar at Battleground by causing a no contest for his WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Seth Rollins and then proceeded to controversially defeat Lesnar in a rematch at SummerSlam. The feud ended at the 2015 Hell in a Cell event with Lesnar defeating Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania%20XXX
"The 199192 FA Cup third round match between Wrexham and Arsenal was played at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham on 4 January 1992. Billed as a potential cup upset by the media, the visitors went into the match as favourites given the gulf in divisions that separated the two teams. Arsenal entered the FA Cup in the third round, as they participated in the Football League First Division, while Wrexham of the Fourth Division won their first two ties to reach this stage of the competition. Watched by a near capacity crowd, the visitors Arsenal began the tie more strongly, but failed to convert their chances. They took the lead minutes before half time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match went, and they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. Two minutes later, the home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once the whistle blew for full time the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters. Wrexham's reward was a fourth round tie against West Ham United which they lost in a replay. Referred to as one of the greatest FA Cup giant killings of all time, Arsenal manager George Graham described Wrexham's win as his lowest moment in football. Graham recovered to guide his team to glory in the competition the following season, as they beat Sheffield Wednesday in the 1993 Cup final. Arsenal were the reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 199091. The team had only lost one match in their successful league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished bottom of the entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but The Football League's plan to expand its competition in time for the 199192 season meant there was to be no demotion. Both clubs met once previously in all competitions an FA Cup quarter final played on 11 March 1978 which Arsenal won by three goals to two. Wrexham qualified for the third round of the 199192 FA Cup after beating Winsford United 52 in the first round and Telford 10 in the second round. Arsenal, like the other top division clubs, entered the competition in the third round. They went into the match as strong favourites Vinnie Wright's pools forecast in The Times predicted an away win, though Wrexham manager Brian Flynn noted On paper they should murder us, but the match isn't being played on paper. Indeed, a match preview compiled by Times journalist Clive White warned against complacency for the visitors Wrexham are no push overs at home and may be encouraged by the absence of Limpar, Wright and Bould in the Arsenal team. Wrexham's precarious league position was covered in a The Guardian feature piece, which examined the feasibility of the club's ambitious redevelopment project. As part of a 42 million plan, Wrexham secretary David Rhodes proposed a new 5,000 all seater stadium, while its Racecourse Ground would be converted into a supermarket. The FA Cup tie between Wrexham and Arsenal was not televised live in the United Kingdom, though regular updates were broadcast on BBC Radio 5, Final Score and ITV's Results Service. The match was the featured game on BBC One's Match of the Day The Road to Wembley, a highlights programme presented by Des Lynam. Commentary was provided by Tony Gubba. Wrexham's squad included three Welsh internationals, Mickey Thomas, Gordon Davies and substitute Joey Jones. The first eleven was mostly composed of youth graduates, aged 20 years or under. By comparison, Arsenal's squad was greatly experienced with seven England internationals. Manager George Graham named a strong first eleven David O'Leary came in for Bould to partner Tony Adams in defence, while Jimmy Carter made his second start for the club since joining in late 1991. Arsenal got the game underway and won the first corner of the match. Taken by Paul Merson, the ball was flicked on at the near post by O'Leary and reached Alan Smith. The forward's header was obstructed by a Wrexham player, who proceeded to clear it out. It did not take long for Arsenal to create another chance Nigel Winterburn played the ball down the left side of the pitch, finding Merson who ran in towards the penalty area and produced a cross. The ball was cleared, but reached Carter whose effort near the penalty spot went wide of the right side post. Wrexham managed to get into the opposition's area and create half chances, but then Arsenal broke forward again with Kevin Campbell having a shot on target. Gareth Owen nearly scored the opener, when he controlled the ball from a flick on and instinctively took a shot that whistled past the post. Two minutes before the interval, Arsenal took the lead. Merson surged forward into the penalty area and his cross was met Smith who slid the ball past goalkeeper Vince O'Keefe. Wrexham almost equalised immediately from the restart, but David Seaman denied Steve Watkin by rushing towards the midfielder and obstructing him. In the second half, Arsenal struggled to overrun Wrexham as the home side limited their time on the ball and closed players down quickly. Long ball tactics from Arsenal however still saw chances, as Winterburn hit the bar and Campbell had a shot blocked by O'Keefe. In the 82nd minute, Wrexham were awarded free kick from 25 yards 23 m . Having faked to take it quickly, Thomas lined up the shot which arrowed into the top corner past Seaman. The Arsenal goalkeeper had got fingertips from his right hand to the effort, but not enough to stop it flying in. Within two minutes of the equaliser, Wrexham went ahead a poor clearance by Winterburn resulted in Davies latching onto the ball over the top and, instead of volleying an effort on goal, he squared it for Watkin. Adams went across the midfielder in an attempt to intervene, but fumbled. An outstretching Watkin poked the ball past Seaman which went beneath the goalkeeper. Arsenal responded by dominating the final minutes with repeated attacks, but Wrexham's defence stood firm. Carter had the ball in the net late on, but the referee ruled the goal out for offside the final whistle was blown moments later and sparked a pitch invasion from the joyous home fans. Match rules A jubilant Thomas described the free kick as the most crucial goal of his career, and believed Wrexham had every chance of causing another upset in the next round, despite an unfavourable away draw We are disappointed not to be at home but after beating the champions we're not afraid of anyone. He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. It gives me energy, I feel stronger and believe in it. His manager Flynn admitted Thomas trains when he wants to train, and added I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. And if he was 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for 5m. Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Mickey Thomas following the match Graham offered no complaints and told reporters I thought they played very well. We just didn't finish them off. It's a thin dividing line between success and failure. He went on to call the defeat his lowest moment in football. Wrexham midfielder Davies accused Arsenal of underestimating their opponents and felt their unrest at having conceded the equaliser worked to the home side's advantage I thought they were going to be a lot more professional when they were leading and tighten it up. They treated it as a training match. We've got a team of youngsters and two old men and perhaps our desire to win was greater than theirs. Wrexham were drawn to play West Ham United in the fourth round, where they secured a 22 draw at the Boleyn Ground thanks to goals from Wayne Phillips and Lee Jones. The replay was played on 4 February with a solitary West Ham goal coming from defender Colin Foster, securing a 10 win in front of 17,995 fans at the Racecourse Ground. Arsenal's league form in the meantime stuttered as they recorded no wins in January. The team ended the campaign strongly, putting together a sequence of 16 games unbeaten to finish fourth. In the cup competitions the following season Arsenal performed better Graham guided his team to success in the Football League and FA Cup finals. On the 20th anniversary of the match, Thomas recalled the goal as ...the one people talk about. I dont mind, though. It's still my best ever. He disclosed that his teammates never thought Wrexham had a chance of progressing into the fourth round, rather we just wondered how many they were going to score. Cited as one of the greatest upsets in Cup history, commentator John Motson described the Wrexham Arsenal tie as a giant killing which has stood the test of time. In 2013, the match came top in a list of greatest ever FA Cup upsets, as voted for by ESPN viewers. It received 48.01 of the vote, with Sutton defeating Coventry coming in second 40.25 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham%20A.F.C.%202%E2%80%931%20Arsenal%20F.C.
"The Wright brothers Orville August 19, 1871 January 30, 1948 and Wilbur April 16, 1867 May 30, 1912 were two American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier than air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405, the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. Although not the first to build experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed wing powered flight possible. The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This method remains standard on fixed wing aircraft of all kinds. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving the flying problem . This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines. Using a small homebuilt wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers. Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces. The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice. From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers. The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry. The Wright brothers were two of seven children born to Milton Wright 18281917 , of English and Dutch ancestry, and Susan Catherine Koerner 18311889 , of German and Swiss ancestry. Milton Wright's mother, Catherine Reeder, was descended from the progenitor of the Vanderbilt family and the Huguenot Gano family of New Rochelle, New York. Wilbur was born near Millville, Indiana, in 1867 Orville in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871. The brothers never married. The other Wright siblings were Reuchlin 18611920 , Lorin 18621939 , Katharine 18741929 , and twins Otis and Ida born 1870, died in infancy . The direct paternal ancestry goes back to a Samuel Wright b. 1606 in Essex, England who sailed to America and settled in Massachusetts in 1636. None of the Wright children had middle names. Instead, their father tried hard to give them distinctive first names. Wilbur was named for Willbur Fisk and Orville for Orville Dewey, both clergymen that Milton Wright admired. They were Will and Orv to their friends and in Dayton, their neighbors knew them simply as the Bishop's kids , or the Bishop's boys . Because of their father's position as a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, he traveled often and the Wrights frequently moved twelve times before finally returning permanently to Dayton in 1884. In elementary school, Orville was given to mischief and was once expelled. In 1878 when the family lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, their father brought home a toy helicopter for his two younger sons. The device was based on an invention of French aeronautical pioneer Alphonse Penaud. Made of paper, bamboo and cork with a rubber band to twirl its rotor, it was about a foot long. Wilbur and Orville played with it until it broke, and then built their own. In later years, they pointed to their experience with the toy as the spark of their interest in flying. Both brothers attended high school, but did not receive diplomas. The family's abrupt move in 1884 from Richmond, Indiana, to Dayton, Ohio, where the family had lived during the 1870s, prevented Wilbur from receiving his diploma after finishing four years of high school. The diploma was awarded posthumously to Wilbur on April 16, 1994, which would have been his 127th birthday. In late 1885 or early 1886 Wilbur was struck in the face by a hockey stick while playing an ice skating game with friends, resulting in the loss of his front teeth. He had been vigorous and athletic until then, and although his injuries did not appear especially severe, he became withdrawn. He had planned to attend Yale. Instead, he spent the next few years largely housebound. During this time he cared for his mother who was terminally ill with tuberculosis, read extensively in his father's library and ably assisted his father during times of controversy within the Brethren Church, but also expressed unease over his own lack of ambition. Orville dropped out of high school after his junior year to start a printing business in 1889, having designed and built his own printing press with Wilbur's help. Wilbur joined the print shop, and in March the brothers launched a weekly newspaper, the West Side News. Subsequent issues listed Orville as publisher and Wilbur as editor on the masthead. In April 1890 they converted the paper to a daily, The Evening Item, but it lasted only four months. They then focused on commercial printing. One of their clients was Orville's friend and classmate, Paul Laurence Dunbar, who rose to international acclaim as a ground breaking African American poet and writer. For a brief period the Wrights printed the Dayton Tattler, a weekly newspaper that Dunbar edited. Capitalizing on the national bicycle craze spurred by the invention of the safety bicycle and its substantial advantages over the penny farthing design , in December 1892 the brothers opened a repair and sales shop the Wright Cycle Exchange, later the Wright Cycle Company and in 1896 began manufacturing their own brand. They used this endeavor to fund their growing interest in flight. In the early or mid 1890s they saw newspaper or magazine articles and probably photographs of the dramatic glides by Otto Lilienthal in Germany. 1896 brought three important aeronautical events. In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam powered fixed wing model aircraft. In mid year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider. These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began. Wilbur said, Lilienthal was without question the greatest of the precursors, and the world owes to him a great debt. In May 1899 Wilbur wrote a letter to the Smithsonian Institution requesting information and publications about aeronautics. Drawing on the work of Sir George Cayley, Chanute, Lilienthal, Leonardo da Vinci, and Langley, they began their mechanical aeronautical experimentation that year. The Wright brothers always presented a unified image to the public, sharing equally in the credit for their invention. Biographers note that Wilbur took the initiative in 18991900, writing of my machine and my plans before Orville became deeply involved when the first person singular became the plural we and our . Author James Tobin asserts, it is impossible to imagine Orville, bright as he was, supplying the driving force that started their work and kept it going from the back room of a store in Ohio to conferences with capitalists, presidents, and kings. Will did that. He was the leader, from the beginning to the end. Despite Lilienthal's fate, the brothers favored his strategy to practice gliding in order to master the art of control before attempting motor driven flight. The death of British aeronaut Percy Pilcher in another hang gliding crash in October 1899 only reinforced their opinion that a reliable method of pilot control was the key to successfuland safeflight. At the outset of their experiments they regarded control as the unsolved third part of the flying problem . They believed sufficiently promising knowledge of the other two issueswings and enginesalready existed. The Wright brothers thus differed sharply from more experienced practitioners of the day, notably Clement Ader, Maxim and Langley who built powerful engines, attached them to airframes equipped with unproven control devices, and expected to take to the air with no previous flying experience. Although agreeing with Lilienthal's idea of practice, the Wrights saw that his method of balance and control by shifting his body weight was inadequate. They were determined to find something better. On the basis of observation, Wilbur concluded that birds changed the angle of the ends of their wings to make their bodies roll right or left. The brothers decided this would also be a good way for a flying machine to turnto bank or lean into the turn just like a birdand just like a person riding a bicycle, an experience with which they were thoroughly familiar. Equally important, they hoped this method would enable recovery when the wind tilted the machine to one side lateral balance . They puzzled over how to achieve the same effect with man made wings and eventually discovered wing warping when Wilbur idly twisted a long inner tube box at the bicycle shop. Other aeronautical investigators regarded flight as if it were not so different from surface locomotion, except the surface would be elevated. They thought in terms of a ship's rudder for steering, while the flying machine remained essentially level in the air, as did a train or an automobile or a ship at the surface. The idea of deliberately leaning, or rolling, to one side seemed either undesirable or did not enter their thinking. Some of these other investigators, including Langley and Chanute, sought the elusive ideal of inherent stability , believing the pilot of a flying machine would not be able to react quickly enough to wind disturbances to use mechanical controls effectively. The Wright brothers, on the other hand, wanted the pilot to have absolute control. For that reason, their early designs made no concessions toward built in stability such as dihedral wings . They deliberately designed their 1903 first powered flyer with anhedral drooping wings, which are inherently unstable, but less susceptible to upset by gusty cross winds. In July 1899 Wilbur put wing warping to the test by building and flying a biplane kite with a five foot 1.5m wingspan. When the wings were warped, or twisted, one end of the wings produced more lift and the other end less lift. The unequal lift made the wings tilt, or bank the end with more lift rose, while the other end dropped, causing a turn in the direction of the lower end. The warping was controlled by four cords attached to the kite, which led to two sticks held by the kite flyer, who tilted them in opposite directions to twist the wings. In 1900 the brothers went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to begin their manned gliding experiments. In his reply to Wilbur's first letter, Octave Chanute had suggested the mid Atlantic coast for its regular breezes and soft sandy landing surface. Wilbur also requested and examined U.S. Weather Bureau data, and decided on Kitty Hawk after receiving information from the government meteorologist stationed there. Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters, who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights. The Wrights based the design of their kite and full size gliders on work done in the 1890s by other aviation pioneers. They adopted the basic design of the Chanute Herring biplane hang glider double decker as the Wrights called it , which flew well in the 1896 experiments near Chicago, and used aeronautical data on lift that Otto Lilienthal had published. The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of the top surface. The brothers did not discover this principle, but took advantage of it. The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley. Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used cambered wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces. The wooden uprights between the wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge building design he used for his biplane glider initially built as a triplane . The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them from, a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal. Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as he did not want to have to explain to their father, Bishop Wright, if Orville got injured. This airfoil caused severe stability problems the Wrights modified the camber on site. The brothers flew the glider for only a few days in the early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, probably on October 3, Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes. Most of the kite tests were unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast. They tested wing warping using control ropes from the ground. The glider was also tested unmanned while suspended from a small homemade tower. Wilbur, but not Orville, made about a dozen free glides on only a single day, October 20. For those tests the brothers trekked four miles 6 km south to the Kill Devil Hills, a group of sand dunes up to 100 feet 30 m high where they made camp in each of the next three years . Although the glider's lift was less than expected, the brothers were encouraged because the craft's front elevator worked well and they had no accidents. However, the small number of free glides meant they were not able to give wing warping a true test. The pilot lay flat on the lower wing, as planned, to reduce aerodynamic drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through an opening in the wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years. Hoping to improve lift, they built the 1901 glider with a much larger wing area and made dozens of flights in July and August for distances of 50 to 400 ft 15 to 122 m . The glider stalled a few times, but the parachute effect of the forward elevator allowed Wilbur to make a safe flat landing, instead of a nose dive. These incidents wedded the Wrights even more strongly to the canard design, which they did not give up until 1910. The glider, however, delivered two major disappointments. It produced only about one third the lift calculated and sometimes pointed opposite the intended direction of a turna problem later known as adverse yawwhen Wilbur used the wing warping control. On the trip home a deeply dejected Wilbur remarked to Orville that man would not fly in a thousand years. The poor lift of the gliders led the Wrights to question the accuracy of Lilienthal's data, as well as the Smeaton coefficient of air pressure, a value which had been in use for over 100 years and was part of the accepted equation for lift. L lift in pounds k coefficient of air pressure Smeaton coefficient S total area of lifting surface in square feet V velocity headwind plus ground speed in miles per hour CL coefficient of lift varies with wing shape The Wrights used this equation to calculate the amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years a wide variety of values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 0.0033 similar to the number Langley used , not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift. To learn whether errors actually existed in Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle for a new type of experiment. They made a model size airfoil and a counter acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and dragor all of themwere in error. They then built a six foot 1.8m wind tunnel in their shop and between October and December 1901 conducted systematic tests on dozens of miniature wings. The balances they devised and mounted inside the tunnel to hold the wings looked crude, made of bicycle spokes and scrap metal, but were as critical to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers as were the gliders. The devices allowed the brothers to balance lift against drag and accurately calculate the performance of each wing. They could also see which wings worked well as they looked through the viewing window in the top of the tunnel. The tests yielded a trove of valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value, and that Lilienthal's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done. Before the detailed wind tunnel tests, Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation to give a lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 190001 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report was published in the Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition. Lilienthal had made whirling arm tests on only a few wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a different shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense . An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio wingspan divided by chordthe wing's front to back dimension . Such shapes offered much better lift to drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far. With this knowledge, and a more accurate Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord . The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations. With characteristic caution, the brothers first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite, as they had done with their two previous versions. Rewarding their wind tunnel work, the glider produced the expected lift. It also had a new structural feature a fixed, rear vertical rudder, which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems. By 1902 they realized that wing warping created differential drag at the wingtips. Greater lift at one end of the wing also increased drag, which slowed that end of the wing, making the glider swivelor yaw so the nose pointed away from the turn. That was how the tailless 1901 glider behaved. The improved wing design enabled consistently longer glides, and the rear rudder prevented adverse yawso effectively that it introduced a new problem. Sometimes when the pilot attempted to level off from a turn, the glider failed to respond to corrective wing warping and persisted into a tighter turn. The glider would slide toward the lower wing, which hit the ground, spinning the aircraft around. The Wrights called this well digging . Orville apparently visualized that the fixed rudder resisted the effect of corrective wing warping when attempting to level off from a turn. He wrote in his diary that on the night of October 2, I studied out a new vertical rudder . The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problem. They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot's warping cradle , so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing warping and rudder deflection. Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag and lift due to warping. The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance. Furthermore, when the glider banked into a turn, rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft in the direction of the turn, eliminating adverse yaw. In short, the Wrights discovered the true purpose of the movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight as a rudder does in sailing , but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turnthe change in directionwas done with roll control using wing warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing warping. With their new method the Wrights achieved true control in turns for the first time on October 8, 1902, a major milestone. From September 19 to October 24 they made between 700 and 1,000 glides, the longest lasting 26 seconds and covering 622.5 feet 189.7 m . Hundreds of well controlled glides after they made the rudder steerable convinced them they were ready to build a powered flying machine. Thus did three axis control evolve wing warping for roll lateral motion , forward elevator for pitch up and down and rear rudder for yaw side to side . On March 23, 1903, the Wrights applied for their famous patent for a Flying Machine , based on their successful 1902 glider. Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of three axis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to, or even more significant, than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer. Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplane. In 1903 the brothers built the powered Wright Flyer, using their preferred material for construction, spruce, a strong and lightweight wood, and Pride of the West muslin for surface coverings. They also designed and carved their own wooden propellers, and had a purpose built gasoline engine fabricated in their bicycle shop. They thought propeller design would be a simple matter and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding. However, their library research disclosed no established formulae for either marine or air propellers, and they found themselves with no sure starting point. They discussed and argued the question, sometimes heatedly, until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane. On that basis, they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers. The finished blades were just over eight feet long, made of three laminations of glued spruce. The Wrights decided on twin pusher propellers counter rotating to cancel torque , which would act on a greater quantity of air than a single relatively slow propeller and not disturb airflow over the leading edge of the wings. Wilbur made a March 1903 entry in his notebook indicating the prototype propeller was 66 efficient. Modern wind tunnel tests on reproduction 1903 propellers show they were more than 75 efficient under the conditions of the first flights, a remarkable feat , and actually had a peak efficiency of 82 . The Wrights wrote to several engine manufacturers, but none could meet their need for a sufficiently lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight down the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice at the time. The Wright Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air the fuel air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders. The propeller drive chains, resembling those of bicycles, were supplied by a manufacturer of heavy duty automobile chains. The Flyer cost less than a thousand dollars, in contrast to more than 50,000 in government funds given to Samuel Langley for his man carrying Great Aerodrome. In 1903 1000 was equivalent to 28,000 in 2018. The Wright Flyer had a wingspan of 40.3 ft 12.3 m , weighed 605 lb 274 kg and had a 12 horsepower 8.9 kW 180 lb 82 kg engine. In camp at Kill Devil Hills, they endured weeks of delays caused by broken propeller shafts during engine tests. After the shafts were replaced requiring two trips back to Dayton , Wilbur won a coin toss and made a three second flight attempt on December 14, 1903, stalling after takeoff and causing minor damage to the Flyer. Because December 13, 1903, was a Sunday, the brothers did not make any attempts that day, even though the weather was good, so their first powered test flight happened on the 121st anniversary of the first hot air balloon test flight that the Montgolfier brothers had done, on December 14, 1782. In a message to their family, Wilbur referred to the trial as having only partial success , stating the power is ample, and but for a trifling error due to lack of experience with this machine and this method of starting, the machine would undoubtedly have flown beautifully. Following repairs, the Wrights finally took to the air on December 17, 1903, making two flights each from level ground into a freezing headwind gusting to 27 miles per hour 43 km h . The first flight, by Orville at 10 35 am, of 120 feet 37 m in 12 seconds, at a speed of only 6.8 miles per hour 10.9 km h over the ground, was recorded in a famous photograph. The next two flights covered approximately 175 and 200 feet 53 and 61 m , by Wilbur and Orville respectively. Their altitude was about 10 feet 3.0 m above the ground. The following is Orville Wright's account of the final flight of the day Wilbur started the fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, but by the time three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began pitching again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two. Five people witnessed the flights Adam Etheridge, John T. Daniels who snapped the famous first flight photo using Orville's pre positioned camera and Will Dough, all of the U.S. government coastal lifesaving crew area businessman W.C. Brinkley and Johnny Moore, a teenaged boy who lived in the area. After the men hauled the Flyer back from its fourth flight, a powerful gust of wind flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the Wright Flyer never flew again. The brothers shipped the airplane home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to a British museum see Smithsonian dispute below , before it was finally installed in 1948 in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., its current residence. The Wrights sent a telegram about the flights to their father, requesting that he inform press. However, the Dayton Journal refused to publish the story, saying the flights were too short to be important. Meanwhile, against the brothers' wishes, a telegraph operator leaked their message to a Virginia newspaper, which concocted a highly inaccurate news article that was reprinted the next day in several newspapers elsewhere, including Dayton. The Wrights issued their own factual statement to the press in January. Nevertheless, the flights did not create public excitementif people even knew about themand the news soon faded. In Paris, however, Aero Club of France members, already stimulated by Chanute's reports of Wright gliding successes, took the news more seriously and increased their efforts to catch up to the brothers. Modern analysis by Professor Fred E. C. Culick and Henry R. Jex in 1985 has demonstrated that the 1903 Wright Flyer was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider. In a recreation attempt on the event's 100th anniversary on December 17, 2003, Kevin Kochersberger, piloting an exact replica, failed in his effort to match the success that the Wright brothers had achieved with their piloting skill. In 1904 the Wrights built the Flyer II. They decided to avoid the expense of travel and bringing supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles 13 km northeast of Dayton. The Wrights referred to the airfield as Simms Station in their flying school brochure. They received permission to use the field rent free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half. The Wrights were glad to be free from the distraction of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government funded unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos Dumont . The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine. At Huffman Prairie, lighter winds made takeoffs harder, and they had to use a longer starting rail than the 60 foot 18 m rail used at Kitty Hawk. The first flights in 1904 revealed problems with longitudinal stability, solved by adding ballast and lengthening the supports for the elevator. During the spring and summer they suffered many hard landings, often damaging the aircraft and causing minor injuries. On August 13, making an unassisted takeoff, Wilbur finally exceeded their best Kitty Hawk effort with a flight of 1,300 feet 400 m . Then they decided to use a weight powered catapult to make takeoffs easier and tried it for the first time on September 7. On September 20, 1904, Wilbur flew the first complete circle in history by a manned heavier than air powered machine, covering 4,080 feet 1,244 m in about a minute and a half. Their two best flights were November 9 by Wilbur and December 1 by Orville, each exceeding five minutes and covering nearly three miles in almost four circles. By the end of the year the brothers had accumulated about 50 minutes in the air in 105 flights over the rather soggy 85 acres 34 ha pasture, which, remarkably, is virtually unchanged today from its original condition and is now part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, adjacent to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The Wrights scrapped the battered and much repaired aircraft, but saved the engine, and in 1905 built a new airplane, the Flyer III. Nevertheless, at first this Flyer offered the same marginal performance as the first two. Its maiden flight was on June 23 and the first few flights were no longer than 10 seconds. After Orville suffered a bone jarring and potentially fatal crash on July 14, they rebuilt the Flyer with the forward elevator and rear rudder both enlarged and placed several feet farther away from the wings. They also installed a separate control for the rear rudder instead of linking it to the wing warping cradle as before. Each of the three axespitch, roll and yawnow had its own independent control. These modifications greatly improved stability and control, enabling a series of six dramatic long flights ranging from 17 to 38 minutes and 11 to 24 miles 39 km around the three quarter mile course over Huffman Prairie between September 26 and October 5. Wilbur made the last and longest flight, 24.5 miles 39.4 km in 38 minutes and 3 seconds, ending with a safe landing when the fuel ran out. The flight was seen by a number of people, including several invited friends, their father Milton, and neighboring farmers. Reporters showed up the next day only their second appearance at the field since May the previous year , but the brothers declined to fly. The long flights convinced the Wrights they had achieved their goal of creating a flying machine of practical utility which they could offer to sell. The only photos of the flights of 19041905 were taken by the brothers. A few photos were damaged in the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, but most survived intact. In 1904 Ohio beekeeping businessman Amos Root, a technology enthusiast, saw a few flights including the first circle. Articles he wrote for his beekeeping magazine were the only published eyewitness reports of the Huffman Prairie flights, except for the unimpressive early hop local newsmen saw. Root offered a report to Scientific American magazine, but the editor turned it down. As a result, the news was not widely known outside Ohio, and was often met with skepticism. The Paris edition of the Herald Tribune headlined a 1906 article on the Wrights FLYERS OR LIARS In years to come, Dayton newspapers would proudly celebrate the hometown Wright brothers as national heroes, but the local reporters somehow missed one of the most important stories in history as it was happening a few miles from their doorstep. James M. Cox, publisher at that time of the Dayton Daily News later governor of Ohio and Democratic presidential nominee in 1920 , expressed the attitude of newspapermenand the publicin those days when he admitted years later, Frankly, none of us believed it. A few newspapers published articles about the long flights, but no reporters or photographers had been there. The lack of splashy eyewitness press coverage was a major reason for disbelief in Washington, D.C. and Europe and in journals like Scientific American, whose editors doubted the alleged experiments and asked how U.S. newspapers, alert as they are, allowed these sensational performances to escape their notice. In October 1904, the brothers were visited by the first of many important Europeans they would befriend in coming years, Colonel J. E. Capper, later superintendent of the Royal Balloon Factory. Capper and his wife were visiting the United States to investigate the aeronautical exhibits at the St. Louis World Fair, but had been given a letter of introduction to both Chanute and the Wrights by Patrick Alexander. Capper was very favorably impressed by the Wrights, who showed him photographs of their aircraft in flight. The Wright brothers were certainly complicit in the lack of attention they received. Fearful of competitors stealing their ideas, and still without a patent, they flew on only one more day after October 5. From then on, they refused to fly anywhere unless they had a firm contract to sell their aircraft. They wrote to the U.S. government, then to Britain, France and Germany with an offer to sell a flying machine, but were rebuffed because they insisted on a signed contract before giving a demonstration. They were unwilling even to show their photographs of the airborne Flyer. The American military, having recently spent 50,000 on the Langley Aerodromea product of the nation's foremost scientistonly to see it plunge twice into the Potomac River like a handful of mortar , was particularly unreceptive to the claims of two unknown bicycle makers from Ohio. Thus, doubted or scorned, the Wright brothers continued their work in semi obscurity, while other aviation pioneers like Santos Dumont, Henri Farman, Leon Delagrange and American Glenn Curtiss entered the limelight. In 1906 skeptics in the European aviation community had converted the press to an anti Wright brothers stance. European newspapers, especially those in France, were openly derisive, calling them bluffeurs bluffers . Ernest Archdeacon, founder of the Aero Club de France, was publicly scornful of the brothers' claims in spite of published reports specifically, he wrote several articles and, in 1906, stated that the French would make the first public demonstration of powered flight . The Paris edition of the New York Herald summed up Europe's opinion of the Wright brothers in an editorial on February 10, 1906 The Wrights have flown or they have not flown. They possess a machine or they do not possess one. They are in fact either fliers or liars. It is difficult to fly. It's easy to say, 'We have flown.' In 1908, after the Wrights' first flights in France, Archdeacon publicly admitted that he had done them an injustice. The Wright brothers made no flights at all in 1906 and 1907. They spent the time attempting to persuade the U.S. and European governments that they had invented a successful flying machine and were prepared to negotiate a contract to sell such machines. They also experimented with a pontoon and engine setup on the Miami River Ohio in hopes of flying from the water. These experiments proved unsuccessful. Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. military expressed virtually no interest in their claims. The brothers turned their attention to Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there for the first time in 1907 for face to face talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights. In France Wilbur met Frank P. Lahm, a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Aeronautical Division. Writing to his superiors, Lahm smoothed the way for Wilbur to give an in person presentation to the U.S. Board of Ordnance and Fortification in Washington, D.C. when he returned to the U.S. This time, the Board was favorably impressed, in contrast to its previous indifference. With further input from the Wrights, the U.S. Army Signal Corps issued Specification 486 in December 1907, inviting bids for construction of a flying machine under military contract. The Wrights submitted their bid in January. In early 1908 the brothers also agreed to a contract with a French company. In May they went back to Kitty Hawk with their 1905 Flyer to practice in private for their all important public demonstration flights, as required by both contracts. Their privacy was lost when New York newspapers heard about the tests and sent several reporters to the scene. Their contracts required them to fly with a passenger, so they modified the 1905 Flyer by installing two seats and adding upright control levers. After tests with sandbags in the passenger seat, Charlie Furnas, a helper from Dayton, became the first fixed wing aircraft passenger on a few short flights May 14, 1908. For safety, and as a promise to their father, Wilbur and Orville did not fly together. However, several newspaper accounts at the time mistakenly took Orville's flight with Furnas as both brothers flying together. Later that day after flying solo seven minutes, Wilbur suffered his worst crash whenstill not well acquainted with the two new control levershe apparently moved one the wrong way and slammed the Flyer into the sand at between 40 and 50 miles per hour 64 and 80 km h . He emerged with only bruises and a cut nose, but the accident ended the practice flightsand the airplane's flying career. In October 1911, Orville Wright returned to the Outer Banks again, to conduct safety and stabilization tests with a new glider. On October 24, he soared for nine minutes and 45 seconds, a record that held for almost 10 years, when gliding as a sport began in the 1920s. The brothers' contracts with the U.S. Army and a French syndicate depended on successful public flight demonstrations that met certain conditions. The brothers had to divide their efforts. Wilbur sailed for Europe Orville would fly near Washington, D.C. Facing much skepticism in the French aeronautical community and outright scorn by some newspapers that called him a bluffeur , Wilbur began official public demonstrations on August 8, 1908, at the Hunaudieres horse racing track near the town of Le Mans, France. His first flight lasted only one minute 45 seconds, but his ability to effortlessly make banking turns and fly a circle amazed and stunned onlookers, including several pioneer French aviators, among them Louis Bleriot. In the following days, Wilbur made a series of technically challenging flights, including figure eights, demonstrating his skills as a pilot and the capability of his flying machine, which far surpassed those of all other pioneering aircraft and pilots of the day. The French public was thrilled by Wilbur's feats and flocked to the field by the thousands, and the Wright brothers instantly became world famous. Former doubters issued apologies and effusive praise. L'Aerophile editor Georges Besancon wrote that the flights have completely dissipated all doubts. Not one of the former detractors of the Wrights dare question, today, the previous experiments of the men who were truly the first to fly ... Leading French aviation promoter Ernest Archdeacon wrote, For a long time, the Wright brothers have been accused in Europe of bluff ... They are today hallowed in France, and I feel an intense pleasure ... to make amends. On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, the wife of the brothers' European business agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilburone of many passengers who rode with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Leon Bollee and his family. Bollee was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollee would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollee had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908. Orville followed his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, he made the first hour long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight at an altitude of about 100 feet 30 m , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, Has it got your nerve Nerve repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. Oh, do you mean will I be afraid to fly again The only thing I'm afraid of is that I can't get well soon enough to finish those tests next year. Deeply shocked and upset by the accident, Wilbur determined to make even more impressive flight demonstrations in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, and for a time they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly. The Wrights traveled to Pau, in the south of France, where Wilbur made many more public flights, giving rides to a procession of officers, journalists and statesmenand his sister Katharine on February 15. He trained two French pilots, then transferred the airplane to the French company. In April the Wrights went to Italy where Wilbur assembled another Flyer, giving demonstrations and training more pilots. An Italian cameraman Federico Valle climbed aboard and filmed the first motion picture from an airplane. After their return to the U.S., the brothers and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour at an average of speed of 40 miles an hour 64 km h and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for 30,000 equivalent to 837,000 in 2018 , including a 5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification. Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson Fulton Celebration, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33 minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America. On May 25, 1910, back at Huffman Prairie, Orville piloted two unique flights. First, he took off on a six minute flight with Wilbur as his passenger, the only time the Wright brothers ever flew together. They received permission from their father to make the flight. They had always promised Milton they would never fly together to avoid the chance of a double tragedy and to ensure one brother would remain to continue their experiments. Next, Orville took his 82 year old father on a nearly seven minute flight, the only one of Milton Wright's life. The aircraft rose to about 350 feet 107 m while the elderly Wright called to his son, Higher, Orville, higher The Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves, but it was rejected. In January 1904, they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin, and on May 22, 1906, they were granted U.S. Patent 821393 for new and useful Improvements in Flying Machines . The patent illustrates a non powered flying machinenamely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral roll control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending. Attempting to circumvent the patent, Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights. Soon after the historic July 4, 1908, one kilometer flight by Curtiss in the AEA June Bug, the Wrights warned him not to infringe their patent by profiting from flying or selling aircraft that used ailerons. Curtiss was at the time a member of the Aerial Experiment Association AEA , headed by Alexander Graham Bell, where in 1908 he had helped reinvent wingtip ailerons for their Aerodrome No. 2, known as the AEA White Wing the AEA's other members became dismayed when Curtiss unexpectedly dropped out of their organization they later came to believe he had sold the rights to their joint innovation to the United States Government . Curtiss refused to pay license fees to the Wrights and sold an airplane equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909. The Wrights filed a lawsuit, beginning a years long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan. The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped in the air and waved his arms, the Wrights would sue. European companies which bought foreign patents the Wrights had received sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged on until the patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made an agreement with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights. The Wright brothers won their initial case against Curtiss in February 1913 when a judge ruled that ailerons were covered under the patent. The Curtiss company appealed the decision. From 1910 until his death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the leading role in the patent struggle, traveling incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed to such an extent that when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle. In January 1914, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against the Curtiss company, which continued to avoid penalties through legal tactics. Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision, and much to the frustration of company executives, he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly. In fact, he was planning to sell the company and departed in 1915. In 1917, with World War I underway, the U.S. government pressured the industry to form a cross licensing organization, the Manufacturers Aircraft Association, to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents, including the original and subsequent Wright patents. The Wright Martin company successor to the Wright company and the Curtiss company which held a number of its own patents each received a 2 million payment. The patent war ended, although side issues lingered in the courts until the 1920s. In a twist of irony, the Wright Aeronautical Corporation another successor and the Curtiss Aeroplane company merged in 1929 to form the Curtiss Wright Corporation, which remains in business today producing high tech components for the aerospace industry. Aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs Smith stated a number of times that the Wrights' legal victory would have been doubtful if an 1868 patent of a prior but lost invention by Matthew Piers Watt Boulton of the UK had been known in the period 19031906. The patent, titled Aerial Locomotion c, described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an aileron control system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot. In fact, this patent was well known to participants in the Wright Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs Smith, saying the Boulton patent is not anticipatory . The lawsuits damaged the public image of the Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10 year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions. The Wright Company was incorporated on November 22, 1909. The brothers sold their patents to the company for 100,000 and also received one third of the shares in a million dollar stock issue and a 10 percent royalty on every airplane sold. With Wilbur as president and Orville as vice president, the company set up a factory in Dayton and a flying school test flight field at Huffman Prairie the headquarters office was in New York City. In mid 1910, the Wrights changed the design of the Wright Flyer, moving the horizontal elevator from the front to the back and adding wheels although keeping the skids as part of the undercarriage unit. It had become apparent by then that a rear elevator would make an airplane easier to control, especially as higher speeds grew more common. The new version was designated the Model B , although the original canard design was never referred to as the Model A by the Wrights. However, the U.S. Army Signal Corps which bought the airplane did call it Wright Type A . There were not many customers for airplanes, so in the spring of 1910 the Wrights hired and trained a team of salaried exhibition pilots to show off their machines and win prize money for the companydespite Wilbur's disdain for what he called the mountebank business . The team debuted at the Indianapolis Speedway on June 13. Before the year was over, pilots Ralph Johnstone and Arch Hoxsey died in air show crashes, and in November 1911 the brothers disbanded the team on which nine men had served four other former team members died in crashes afterward . The Wright Company transported the first known commercial air cargo on November 7, 1910, by flying two bolts of dress silk 65 miles 105 km from Dayton to Columbus, Ohio, for the Morehouse Martens Department Store, which paid a 5,000 fee. Company pilot Phil Parmelee made the flightwhich was more an exercise in advertising than a simple deliveryin an hour and six minutes with the cargo strapped in the passenger's seat. The silk was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs. Between 1910 and 1916 the Wright Brothers Flying School at Huffman Prairie trained 115 pilots who were instructed by Orville and his assistants. Several trainees became famous, including Henry Hap Arnold, who rose to Five Star General, commanded U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II, and became first head of the U.S. Air Force Calbraith Perry Rodgers, who made the first coast to coast flight in 1911 with many stops and crashes in a Wright Model EX named the Vin Fiz after the sponsor's grape soft drink and Eddie Stinson, founder of the Stinson Aircraft Company. In 19121913 a series of fatal crashes of Wright airplanes bought by the U.S. Army called into question their safety and design. The death toll reached 11 by 1913, half of them in the Wright model C. All six model C Army airplanes crashed. They had a tendency to nose dive, but Orville insisted that stalls were caused by pilot error. He cooperated with the Army to equip the airplanes with a rudimentary flight indicator to help the pilot avoid climbing too steeply. A government investigation said the Wright C was dynamically unsuited for flying , and the American military ended its use of airplanes with pusher type propellers, including models made by both the Wright and Curtiss companies, in which the engine was located behind the pilot and likely to crush him in a crash. Orville resisted the switch to manufacturing tractor type propeller aircraft, worried that a design change could threaten the Wright patent infringement case against Curtiss. Samuel Pierpont Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until his death in 1906, experimented for years with model flying machines and successfully flew unmanned powered fixed wing model aircraft in 1896 and 1903. Two tests of his manned full size motor driven Aerodrome in October and December 1903, however, were complete failures. Nevertheless, the Smithsonian later proudly displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier than air craft capable of manned powered flight, relegating the Wright brothers' invention to secondary status and triggering a decades long feud with Orville Wright, whose brother had received help from the Smithsonian when beginning his own quest for flight. Ironically, the Wright brothers were the initial recipients of the Samuel P. Langley Medal for Aerodromics from the Smithsonian in 1910. The Smithsonian based its claim for the Aerodrome on short test flights Glenn Curtiss and his team made with it in 1914. The Smithsonian allowed Curtiss, in an unsavory alliance, to make major modifications to the craft before attempting to fly it. The Smithsonian hoped to salvage Langley's aeronautical reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly Curtiss wanted to prove the same thing to defeat the Wrights' patent lawsuits against him. The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests. Orville repeatedly objected to misrepresentation of the Aerodrome, but the Smithsonian was unyielding. Orville responded by lending the restored 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the London Science Museum in 1928, refusing to donate it to the Smithsonian while the Institution perverted the history of the flying machine. Orville would never see his invention again as he would die before its return to the United States. Charles Lindbergh attempted to mediate the dispute, to no avail. In 1942, after years of bad publicity, and encouraged by Wright biographer Fred C. Kelly, the Smithsonian finally relented by publishing, for the first time, a list of the Aerodrome modifications and recanting misleading statements it had made about the 1914 tests. Orville then privately requested the British museum to return the Flyer, but the airplane remained in protective storage for the duration of World War II and finally came home after Orville's death. On November 23, 1948, the executors of Orville's estate signed an agreement for the Smithsonian to purchase the Flyer for one dollar. At the insistence of the executors, the agreement also included strict conditions for display of the airplane. The agreement reads, in part, Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the 1903 Wright Aeroplane, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight. If this agreement is not fulfilled, the Flyer can be reclaimed by the heir of the Wright brothers. Some aviation enthusiasts, particularly those who promote the legacy of Gustave Whitehead, now accuse the Smithsonian of refusing to investigate claims of earlier flights. After a ceremony in the Smithsonian museum, the Flyer went on public display on December 17, 1948, the 45th anniversary of the only day it was flown successfully. The Wright brothers' nephew Milton Lorin's son , who had seen gliders and the Flyer under construction in the bicycle shop when he was a boy, gave a brief speech and formally transferred the airplane to the Smithsonian, which displayed it with the accompanying label The world's first power driven heavier than air machine in which man made free, controlled, and sustained flight Invented and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright Flown by them at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina December 17, 1903 By original scientific research the Wright brothers discovered the principles of human flight As inventors, builders, and flyers they further developed the aeroplane, taught man to fly, and opened the era of aviation Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped that he did not have time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief training flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose. Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European particularly Parisian philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would come home white . It was decided by the family that a new and far grander house would be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, building had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon the design of the house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914. He became ill on a business trip to Boston in April 1912. The illness is sometimes attributed to eating bad shellfish at a banquet. After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30. His father wrote about Wilbur in his diary A short life, full of consequences. An unfailing intellect, imperturbable temper, great self reliance and as great modesty, seeing the right clearly, pursuing it steadfastly, he lived and died. Orville succeeded to the presidency of the Wright Company upon Wilbur's death. Sharing Wilbur's distaste for business but not his brother's executive skills, Orville sold the company in 1915. After 42 years living at their residence on 7 Hawthorn Street, Orville, Katharine and their father, Milton, moved to Hawthorn Hill in the spring of 1914. Milton died in his sleep on April 3, 1917, at the age of 88. Up until his death, Milton had been very active, preoccupied with reading, writing articles for religious publications and enjoying his morning walks. He had also marched in a Dayton Woman's Suffrage Parade, along with Orville and Katharine. Orville made his last flight as a pilot in 1918 in a 1911 Model B. He retired from business and became an elder statesman of aviation, serving on various official boards and committees, including the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA , predecessor agency to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce ACCA , predecessor to the Aerospace Industries Association AIA . Katharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City, a former Oberlin classmate, in 1926. Orville was furious and inconsolable, feeling he had been betrayed by Katharine. He refused to attend the wedding or even communicate with her. He finally agreed to see her, apparently at Lorin's insistence, just before she died of pneumonia on March 3, 1929. Orville Wright served NACA for 28 years. In 1930, he received the first Daniel Guggenheim Medal established in 1928 by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. In 1936, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. On April 19, 1944, the second production Lockheed Constellation, piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye, flew from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours and 57 minutes 2300 mi 330.9 mph . On the return trip, the airliner stopped at Wright Field to give Orville Wright his last airplane flight, more than 40 years after his historic first flight. He may even have briefly handled the controls. He commented that the wingspan of the Constellation was longer than the distance of his first flight. Orville's last major project was supervising the reclamation and preservation of the 1905 Wright Flyer III, which historians describe as the first practical airplane. Orville expressed sadness in an interview years later about the death and destruction brought about by the bombers of World War II We dared to hope we had invented something that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong ... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in the invention of the airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses. Orville died at age 76 on January 30, 1948, over 35 years after his brother, following his second heart attack, having lived from the horse and buggy age to the dawn of supersonic flight. Both brothers are buried in the family plot at Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio. John T. Daniels, the Coast Guardsman who took their famous first flight photo, died the day after Orville. First flight claims are made for Clement Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for their variously documented tests in years prior to and including 1903. Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos Dumont. Supporters of the post Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights. Those techniques were a launch rail skids instead of wheels a headwind at takeoff and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques. The late aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs Smith was a supporter of the Wrights' claim to primacy in flight. He wrote that a barn door can be made to fly for a short distance if enough energy is applied to it he determined that the very limited flight experiments of Ader, Vuia and others were powered hops instead of fully controlled flights. The U.S. states of Ohio and North Carolina both take credit for the Wright brothers and their world changing inventionsOhio because the brothers developed and built their design in Dayton, and North Carolina because Kitty Hawk was the site of the Wrights' first powered flight. With a spirit of friendly rivalry, Ohio adopted the slogan Birthplace of Aviation later Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers , recognizing not only the Wrights, but also astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, both Ohio natives . The slogan appears on Ohio license plates. North Carolina uses the slogan First In Flight on its license plates. The site of the first flights in North Carolina is preserved as Wright Brothers National Memorial, while their Ohio facilities are part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. As the positions of both states can be factually defended, and each played a significant role in the history of flight, neither state has an exclusive claim to the Wrights' accomplishment. Notwithstanding the competition between those two states, in 1937 the Wrights' final bicycle shop and home were moved from Dayton to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan, where they remain.

"George Cedric Wright April 13, 1889 1959 was an American violinist and a wilderness photographer of the High Sierra. He was Ansel Adams's mentor and best friend for decades, and accompanied Adams when three of his most famous photographs were taken. He was a longtime participant in the annual wilderness High Trips sponsored by the Sierra Club. Cedric Wright was born and raised in Alameda, California. His father was a successful attorney, and one of his father's clients was astronomer Charles Hitchcock Adams, Ansel Adams's father. Cedric's uncle, William Hammond Wright, was also an astronomer who became head of Lick Observatory. As a result of his father's success, Wright was financially comfortable throughout his life. His first wife was Mildred Sahlstrom, and they had a daughter, Alberta. After they divorced, he married pianist and piano teacher Rhea Ufford in 1929. They had a daughter, Joanne, and a son, David. Wright was motivated to become a violinist when he heard a performance by Fritz Kreisler. After study in the United States, he spent seven years studying with Otakar Sevcik in Prague and Vienna. Wright was known as a distinguished violinist , and was a violin teacher at the University of California Extension and Mills College for many years. Renowned violin teacher and conductor Louis Persinger called him one of the foremost performers and instructors in the West . In 1934, arthritis brought an early end to his professional career as a violinist, and he then decided to pursue his hobby of photography as a career. Wright first met Ansel Adams at a family gathering at the Wright family vacation home in the Santa Cruz Mountains when Cedric was about 21 and Ansel was about 8 years old. They encountered each other again on a four week wilderness High Trip in Yosemite National Park, organized by the Sierra Club in 1923. Nancy Newhall wrote, On that first High Trip, Ansel found himself drawn to one Cedric Wright, a violinist, who could fiddle by the fire deep into the night and still be among the first up, making a little fire of twigs... Their friendship, which continued until Wright's death in 1959, was described by Mary Street Alinder as an intense comradeship . The men shared a deep interest in both classical music and photography, since Adams was an accomplished classical pianist. Wright introduced Adams to the writings of the British philosopher Edward Carpenter, whose thoughts helped shape both men's world views. Together, they discussed the works of other writers, including Elbert Hubbard and Walt Whitman. Back in the Bay Area after their initial 1923 wilderness journey together had ended, Adams became a part of Wright's social circle of musicians and Sierra Club activists who gathered at his Berkeley home. Adams idolized Wright, and he followed in Wright's footsteps by taking long trips into the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada each summer, photographing the remote mountain peaks. In his autobiography, Ansel Adams called Cedric Wright my best friend for many years . He described Wright as almost an occupant of another world and a creator and messenger of beauty and mysteries. Perhaps his greatest gift was that of imparting confidence to those who were wavering on the edge of fear and indecision often it was me. In 1926, Wright introduced Adams to Albert Bender, a patron of the arts who was to play an instrumental role in Adams's enormous success as a photographer. Wright was also a close friend of Virginia Best, who was Adams' girlfriend for years. Wright visited with her when Adams was away on photography trips, and she confided in him about the problems in her relationship with Adams. Wright was their best man when they were married on January 2, 1928. Wright accompanied and assisted Adams when he took three of the most famous photographs of his career On April 10, 1927, Wright hiked with Adams, Virginia Best, Charles Michael and another photographer, Arnold Williams, to a rocky perch high above Yosemite Valley called the Diving Board . There, Adams took Monolith, the Face of Half Dome, which Mary Street Alinder called Adams's most significant photograph because it was a triumph of visualization showing extreme manipulation of tonal values . This photo set Adams on the path of becoming America's most well known photographer. Adams called the excursion a personally historic moment in my photographic career. During the 1932 Sierra Club High Trip to Sequoia National Park, Wright and Adams both photographed Precipice Lake near Eagle Scout Peak, while Virginia swam in the lake, still arrayed with icy patches. Wright was shocked when he saw Adams's Frozen Lake and Cliffs, The Sierra Nevada, Sequoia National Park, so much more beautiful than the photos Wright himself had produced. Mary Street Alinder described the image Mirrored ghostly upon the inky waters, a shattered black cliff descends into a partially frozen lake. In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for six months to create photographs of lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a fantastic scene , a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to Get this Get that, for God's sake We don't have much time Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for 609,600. Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography . In 1921, Wright purchased an old dairy barn at 2515 Etna Street in Berkeley, California, and hired architect Bernard Maybeck to remodel it into a home. Nicknamed the barn , Wright's home featured a soaring ceiling with room for a rope swing hung from the rafters and space enough for two grand pianos. Maybeck's daughter in law Jacomena Maybeck remembered evenings at Cedric Wright's studio, when the women wore evening dresses and the men wore tuxedos, and there was much music around the big stone fireplace. The home was known as party central among Sierra Club members of the era. Among that social circle were Richard M. Leonard and his wife Doris, Francis P. Farquhar and his wife Marjorie, David Brower and his wife Anne, Edgar Wayburn and his wife Peggy, and Wright's best friends, Ansel Adams and his wife Virginia. Nancy Newhall described the atmosphere Meanwhile in Cedric Wright's house among the redwoods in Berkeley, Ansel was finding a warm welcome ... In his house there was music for violin and piano there was poetry, especially Whitman. The High Trips were large wilderness excursions organized and led by the Sierra Club, beginning in 1901. While most of these excursions were to the High Sierra, some were to other destinations, such as the Canadian Rockies in 1928. Wright's photos of that trip, along with those of Adams and other photographers, were included in a portfolio produced to commemorate it. No other member participated in as many High Trips as Wright, and David Brower recounted that Wright told him in 1953 that he had participated in 33 High Trips. Tom Turner wrote that Wright was a tireless and talented photographer of the mountain scene, who entertained campers with his fiddle and loved to greet weary hikers at day's end with an unexpected cup of tea or soup. During the High Trips, Wright and his student Dorothy Minty would often entertain groups of 200 participants with performances of Bach's Double Violin Concerto. Arthritis forced Wright to give up his career as a violinist in 1934, and he resolved to pursue his hobby of photography as a new career. In 1939 the Museum of Modern Art accepted six of Wright's photographs, donated by Albert Bender, into its photography collection. These were followed by another ten prints the following year. Several of his photos were displayed at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939 and 1940. Wright's work was also featured in a 1943 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art called Action Photography , along with work by Erich Salomon, Peter Stackpole, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand and Weegee. He was issued a United States patent for a portable photo printing device in 1935. He also made various devices, including collapsible and portable latrines for the High Trips, and astonishingly solid camera and violin cases of varnished plywood with leather thongs, which would tolerate the rigors of being packed for a month on muleback. In an article published in 1957, which included eight full page photographs, Wright described his thoughts about how high mountain beauty resembles great music Beauty haunts the high country like a majestic hymn, sings in cold sunny air, the brilliant mountain airmakes of sunlight a living thingfloats in cloud formsfilters changing floods of light ever clothing the mountains anew. Beauty arrives in deep voice of river and wind through forest, swelling the chorus, giving sonority universal proportions. He dedicated these words to Sierra Club leader William Edward Colby, and they became part of the introduction to Wright's posthumous book, Words of the Earth. Ansel Adams described Wright's final years as complex and difficult . He suffered a stroke, which caused a personality change, and he became rigid and dictatorial , which was a painful experience for all his friends. Wright died in 1959. After his death, Nancy Newhall edited and completed his book, Words of the Earth, which was among the first titles published by Sierra Club Books in 1960. Ansel Adams wrote the foreword. In 1961, a 12,362 foot 3768 meter High Sierra peak was officially named Mount Cedric Wright 365413.9N 1182315.2W 36.903861N 118.387556W 36.903861 118.387556 , in memory of Wright, who was described as an internationally known photographer whose photography has made a significant contribution to the appreciation of the natural scene. The mountain is located in Kings Canyon National Park, 1.9 km 1.2 mi southwest of Colosseum Mountain and 5.3 km 3.3 mi south southeast of Mount Pinchot. Virginia Best Adams later arranged for park ranger Randy Morgenson to scatter Wright's ashes on the slopes of Mount Cedric Wright. In 1976, Ansel Adams and the Sierra Club arranged for Wright's personal papers to be donated to the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. A 2011 exhibit at the Chadwick School featured photos of the school by both Wright and Adams. Two of Wright's children had attended the school. A critic writing for the Los Angeles Times praised Wright's work In the Chadwick exhibition, it's Wright who trumps Adams with the show's most jaw dropping image a 1947 shot of five boys playing basketball on the school's outdoor court, against a backdrop of rolling hills and the Los Angeles Basin far below. It captures a moment of sheer ballet, the composition so gracefully perfect that one would think it had been choreographed by Balanchine except that you can't choreograph players leaping for a rebound.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric%20Wright
"John Jack Wright January 1568 8 November 1605 , and Christopher Kit Wright 1570 8 November 1605 , were members of the group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a conspiracy to assassinate King James I by blowing up the House of Lords. Their sister married another plotter, Thomas Percy. Educated at the same school in York, the Wrights had early links with Guy Fawkes, the man left in charge of the explosives stored in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As known recusants the brothers were on several occasions arrested for reasons of national security. Both were also members of the Earl of Essex's rebellion of 1601. John was one of the first men to join the conspiracy, which was led by Robert Catesby. Christopher joined in March 1605. At about midnight on 4 November Fawkes was discovered and arrested, following which John, Christopher and the rest of the conspirators travelled across the Midlands, attempting to gain support for a popular uprising. Eventually the group opted to wait for the authorities at Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire. On 8 November the Sheriff of Worcester arrived with a large group of armed men, and both brothers were killed in the ensuing firefight. John and Christopher Wright were born to Robert Wright and his second wife, Ursula Rudston, daughter of Nicholas and Jane Rudston of Hayton. John was baptised at Welwick in Yorkshire, on 16 January 1568, and Christopher was born in 1570. Their sister, Martha, married Thomas Percy in 1591. The brothers were pupils at St Peter's School in York, along with Guy Fawkes, whose name has become synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot. Although outwardly conformist, the school's headmaster John Pulleine came from a notable family of Yorkshire recusants, and his predecessor at St Peter's had spent 20 years in prison for his recusancy. Three Catholic priests, Oswald Tesimond, Edward Oldcorn and Robert Middleton, were also educated at St Peter's. John and Christopher were both married, to Dorothy and Margaret respectively. John had a daughter, born some time in the late 1590s. As a precautionary measure, in 1596 they were each arrested during Queen Elizabeth I's illness. They were incarcerated at the White Lyon prison in 1601 for their involvement in the Earl of Essex's rebellion. Both were skilled swordsmen, and John was renowned for his courage. The Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond wrote that he possessed a good physique and sound constitution. Rather on the tall side, his features were pleasing. He was somewhat taciturn in manner, but very loyal to his friends, even if his friends were few . Christopher's appearance was slightly different from that of his brother, not like him in face, as being fatter and a lighter coloured hair and taller of person . According to Father John Gerard, John's involvement with Essex coincided with his conversion to Catholicism. Gerard also noted that John's household, Twigmoor Hall in Lincolnshire, was a place where he had Priests come often, both for his spiritual comfort and their own in corporal helps , although the government's description, a Popish college for traitors , was somewhat less favourable. Following his conversion John became a man of exemplary life . Two years later, as the queen's health waned, a nervous government ensured that John and Christopher were again imprisoned, the English antiquarian William Camden describing them as men hunger starved for innovation . Christopher may have travelled to Spain in 1603 using the alias Anthony Dutton, seeking Spanish support for English Catholics, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that Dutton's role may have been attributed to Christopher by Fawkes and Thomas Wintour, held in the Tower of London after the failure of the plot. Early in 1604 Robert Catesby, a Catholic convert who had lost patience with King James I's lack of toleration of Catholics, invited his cousin Thomas Wintour to a meeting at which John was also present. Catesby proposed to blow up the Parliament House with gunpowder , killing the king and his government, as in that place, have they done us all the mischief . Catesby had not then given up hope on foreign help, and so he sent Wintour to the continent to meet with the Constable of Castille. Wintour also met with Welsh spy Hugh Owen, who introduced him to Guy Fawkes, a man with whose name Catesby was familiar. A fifth conspirator, Thomas Percy, joined them several weeks later. Percy was related to the Wright family by marriage, having wed John's sister, Martha. The group met on 20 May 1604 at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London. After the meeting they swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book and celebrated Mass in another room with Father John Gerard, who was ignorant of their purpose. From these early meetings, according to biographer Mark Nicholls, John exhibited little sign of doubt or scruple thereafter . He remained close to the heart of the conspiracy, moving his family to Lapworth in Warwickshire, and stabling horses there. By March 1605 Christopher had joined the conspiracy as well, but in October that year, as the plan was nearing its culmination, its existence was revealed to the authorities by an anonymous letter delivered to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Uncertain of its meaning Monteagle delivered the letter to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Monteagle's servant was closely related to Christopher's wife, Margaret, and thus the plotters soon became aware of its existence. Catesby, by then at White Webbs near Enfield Chase with the Wright brothers, decided that the letter did not constitute a sufficiently serious threat to the scheme, and he decided to forge ahead. On 4 November Percy visited his patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter. He returned to London and assured John, Thomas Wintour and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about. That same evening John probably set off for the Midlands with Catesby and his servant Thomas Bates, while the others moved into their positions, ready for the planned explosion the following day. At about midnight the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, and in the chamber's undercroft they discovered and arrested Fawkes, who was guarding the gunpowder the conspirators had placed there. As news of Fawkes's capture spread, particularly through the great houses of the Strand, Christopher deduced what had occurred and went to Thomas Wintour at the Duck and Drake inn, exclaiming the matter is discovered . Wintour ordered him to verify the news, and on confirming that the government were seeking Thomas Percy for whom Fawkes, using the alias John Johnson , claimed to be working , ordered him to alert Percy. Christopher and Percy left London together, heading for Dunstable. With the group mostly reintegrated, they spent the next two days moving across Warwickshire and Worcestershire, attempting to drum up support for a rebellion that as time passed became ever more unlikely. On 6 November, the same day they were helping to raid Warwick Castle for supplies, the brothers were identified by the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham as suspects. This prompted the authorities to issue a public proclamation on 7 November naming them and several of their fellow conspirators as wanted men. The group tried unsuccessfully to recruit more rebels at Hewell Grange, but on 7 November, tired and desperate, they decided to make their stand at Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire. On the arrival the following morning of the Sheriff of Worcester and his company of men, a gun battle broke out and Catesby, Percy, and both Wright brothers were shot. With medical attention they might have survived, but the baser sort among the sheriff's men hurriedly stripped them of their clothes Christopher's boots were pulled off to reach his silk stockings , and left them to die.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20and%20Christopher%20Wright
"Richard William Wright 28 July 1943 15 September 2008 was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was a founder member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd, performing on all but one of the group's albums including The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours. Wright grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex and met future Pink Floyd bandmates Roger Waters and Nick Mason while studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic. After being joined by frontman and songwriter Syd Barrett, the group found commercial success in 1967 before Barrett's instability led to him being replaced by David Gilmour and Wright taking over songwriting duties with Waters. Initially a straightforward singer songwriter, Wright later acted as an arranger to Waters and Gilmour's compositions. He began to contribute less towards the end of the 1970s and left the band after touring The Wall in 1981. He rejoined the band as a session player in 1987 for A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and became a full time member again for The Division Bell in 1994. Sessions with Wright during this period were later released on the album The Endless River. Away from Pink Floyd, Wright recorded two solo albums, including a collaboration with Anthony Moore on Broken China, and briefly formed the duo Zee. After rejoining Waters, Mason and Gilmour as Pink Floyd for Live 8 in 2005, he became part of Gilmour's regular solo touring band, singing occasional lead on songs such as Arnold Layne , before his death in September 2008. Overshadowed by bandmates Barrett, Waters and Gilmour, Wright was the quietest and most reserved member of Pink Floyd. His contributions have sometimes been overlooked, but his death brought a reappraisal and recognition of his talents. His jazz and improvisation influences and keyboard performances were an important part of the Pink Floyd sound. As well as being a prominent player of the Farfisa and Hammond organs and the Kurzweil synthesizer, Wright sang regularly in the band and occasionally took the lead vocal on Pink Floyd songs such as Time , Remember a Day and Wearing the Inside Out . Wright, whose father was head biochemist at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School. He taught himself to play guitar, trumpet and piano at age 12 after he was recuperating from breaking a leg. His mother helped and encouraged him to play the piano. He took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music and became influenced by the trad jazz revival, learning the trombone and saxophone as well as the piano. Uncertain about his future, he enrolled in 1962 at the Regent Street Polytechnic which was later incorporated into the University of Westminster. There he met fellow musicians Roger Waters and Nick Mason, and all three joined a band formed by classmate Clive Metcalf called Sigma 6. Wright's position in the band was tenuous to begin with, as he did not choose a definitive instrument, playing piano if a pub had one, otherwise settling on the trombone or rhythm guitar. He moved in with Waters and Mason to a house in Stanhope Gardens, Highgate, and they began serious rehearsals to become a professional group. Although Mason and Waters were competent students, Wright found architecture of little interest and after only a year of study moved to the London College of Music. He took a break from studies and travelled to Greece for a sabbatical. Their landlord, Mike Leonard, purchased a Farfisa organ and briefly replaced Wright in the band. However, the organ ultimately became Wright's main instrument. Through a friend, he arranged the fledgling group's first recording session in a West Hampstead studio, just before Christmas 1964. Guitarists Bob Klose and Syd Barrett joined the band, which became Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid 1965, and after frequent gigging that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As the most qualified musician, Wright was responsible for tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner to tune guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear at the end of each gig. While not credited for vocals on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, he sang lead on Barrett penned songs like Astronomy Domine and Matilda Mother . Examples of his early compositions include Remember a Day , See Saw , Paint Box and It Would Be So Nice . Wright was close friends with Barrett, and at one point the pair shared a flat in Richmond. After Barrett left the group in 1968 owing to mental health issues, Wright considered leaving and forming a group with him, but realised it would not have been practical. Following Barrett's departure and replacement by David Gilmour, Wright took over writing duties with Waters but gradually became less involved as a singer and songwriter as the band's career progressed. His organ playing remained an important part of the band's live set, including Interstellar Overdrive , Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun and Careful with That Axe, Eugene and he contributed musical themes for film scores More, Zabriskie Point and Obscured by Clouds . He made significant contributions to Pink Floyd's long, epic compositions such as Atom Heart Mother , Echoes on which he harmonised with Gilmour for the lead vocals and Shine On You Crazy Diamond . On 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon he composed the music for The Great Gig in the Sky and Us and Them . He also contributed to other album tracks such as Breathe and Time , singing the lead vocals on the latter's chorus. Wright's contributions to the band diminished in the late 1970s as Waters began to write more material, with Animals being the first album where he did not receive any songwriter credits. By the time the group was recording The Wall in 1979, Waters had become frustrated that Wright was not contributing enough yet still claiming an equal share of production royalties. Wright refused to catch up on the recording backlog as his first marriage had deteriorated and he had not seen enough of his children, deciding family was more important. Both myself and Dave... had little to offer, through laziness or whatever, he admitted. Looking back, although I didn't realise it, I was depressed. Waters considered suing Wright, but ultimately decided an easier thing to do would be for Wright to leave the band at the end of the project. As the band was in financial trouble at the time, Wright agreed. Waters, Gilmour, producer Bob Ezrin, composer Michael Kamen and session player Fred Mandel played keyboards on The Wall. Wright was retained as a salaried session musician during concerts to promote that album in 198081, and became the only member of Pink Floyd to profit from the initial run of the costly Wall shows, since the net financial loss had to be borne by the remaining full time members. Wright did not attend the 1982 premiere of the film version of Pink FloydThe Wall. In 1983, Pink Floyd released The Final Cut, the only album from the band on which Wright does not appear. His absence from the credits was the first time fans realised he had left the group, which was officially confirmed some years later. After Waters' departure in 1985, Wright began to contribute to Pink Floyd again, beginning with sessions for A Momentary Lapse of Reason. However, he did not legally rejoin as an equal to Gilmour and Mason, and was a salaried musician for the resulting tour, as his contract said he could not rejoin as a full member. On the album credits, his name was listed after Mason and Gilmour and his photo did not appear on the cover. By 1994, he had rejoined the group full time. I am a full member, he clarified in 2000, but contractually I am not on a level par with Dave and Nick. He cowrote five songs and sang lead on Wearing the Inside Out for the next Floyd album, The Division Bell. This was followed by the double live album and video release Pulse in 1995. Wright, like Mason, performed on every Floyd tour. On 2 July 2005, Wright, Gilmour and Mason were joined by Waters on stage for the first time since the Wall concerts for a short set at the Live 8 concert in London. This was the last time that all four post Barrett Pink Floyd members performed together. Wright underwent eye surgery for cataracts in November 2005, preventing him attending Floyd's induction to the UK Music Hall of Fame. Wright's last Floyd appearance, a posthumous one, was on 2014's The Endless River. The album contained mostly instrumental music recorded during the Division Bell sessions in 199394. Wright rarely played live outside of Pink Floyd compared to the other members. Along with Gilmour, he played in 1970 on Barrett's second solo album, Barrett, and helped with its production. He later recalled working on the album as a way of helping Barrett in any way possible. He guested at a concert by Sutherland Brothers Quiver in 1974 at Newcastle Polytechnic. Wright recorded his first solo project, Wet Dream, in early 1978 in Super Bear Studios, France, which featured touring guitarist Snowy White and saxophonist Mel Collins. The album was released in September with minimal commercial success. During 1984, Wright formed a new musical duo called Zee with Dave Harris from the band Fashion . The pair had been introduced by a mutual friend, saxophonist Raphael Ravenscroft. They signed a record deal with EMI Records and released only one album, Identity, which was a commercial and critical flop. Wright later referred to Zee as an experiment best forgotten . In 1996, inspired by his successful input into The Division Bell, Wright released his second solo album, Broken China, which had been co written with lyricist Anthony Moore, who helped with production and engineering. The album covers the theme of depression and helped Wright come to terms with seeing friends affected by it. Musical contributions came from Pino Palladino on bass, Manu Katche on drums, Dominic Miller known from his guitar work with Sting and Tim Renwick, another Floyd associate, on electric guitar. Gilmour contributed a guitar part for Breakthrough but his performance didn't make the final mix of the album. Wright considered taking the album on tour, but concluded it wouldn't be financially viable. Sinead O'Connor sang lead vocal on two tracks, Reaching for the Rail and Breakthrough , with Wright covering the remainder. In 1999, Pink Floyd touring keyboardist Jon Carin joined with Wright's wife to bring Wright and Waters back together after some 18 years apart the two men met backstage after a tour date by Waters. Wright played at several of Gilmour's solo shows in 2002, contributing keyboards and vocals, including his own composition Breakthrough . In 2006, he became a regular member of Gilmour's solo touring band along with former Floyd sidemen Jon Carin, Dick Parry and Guy Pratt. He contributed keyboards and background vocals to Gilmour's solo album, On an Island, and performed live in Europe and North America that year. On stage with Gilmour he played keyboards, including a revival of the Farfisa for performing Echoes . Wright sang lead on Arnold Layne , which was released as a live single. He declined an offer to join Waters and Mason on The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour to spend more time working on a solo project. In 2006, Wright joined Gilmour and Mason for the official screening of the PULSE DVD. Inevitably, Live 8 surfaced as a subject in an interview. When asked about performing again, Wright replied he would be happy on stage anywhere. He explained that his plan was to meander along and play live whenever Gilmour required his services. The same year, he co wrote the Helen Boulding B side, Hazel Eyes , with Chris Difford. Wright's final vocal performance took place at the Syd Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at The Barbican in London on 10 May 2007. It was organised by Joe Boyd in the memory of Barrett, who had died the previous July. The first half featured a Roger Waters solo performance, while the second half concluded with Wright, alongside David Gilmour and Nick Mason, performing Arnold Layne . His final live performance was as part of Gilmour's band at the premiere of Gilmour's concert DVD Remember That Night on 6 September 2007 at the Odeon Leicester Square, London. After an edited version of the film had been shown, the band took to the stage to jam. Wright married his first wife, Juliette Gale, in 1964. She had been a singer in one of the early bands that evolved into Pink Floyd. They had two children and divorced in 1982. His second marriage to Franka lasted between 1984 and 1994. Wright married his third wife Mildred Millie Hobbs in 1995, with whom he had a son, Ben. Wright's 1996 solo album Broken China is about her battle with depression. They separated in 2007. Wright's daughter Gala was married to Floyd and Gilmour touring bassist Guy Pratt. Wright had been fond of the Greek islands since a sabbatical visit in 1964, before Pink Floyd were formed. He moved to Greece in 1984 after the Zee project, briefly retiring from music, and enjoyed sailing and yachting. In his later years, Wright lived in Le Rouret, France, and spent time on a yacht he owned in the Virgin Islands. He found sailing therapeutic, relieving him from the pressures of the music business. He was also a keen collector of Persian rugs. Wright died at home in London of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. At the time of his death, he had been working on a new solo album, which was thought to comprise a series of instrumental pieces. The surviving members of Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute. Waters said it is hard to overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under rated, and that his playing was the sound that knitted it all together , comparing his quiet one status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him my musical partner and my friend , praised the ability of the two men's voices to blend, such as on Echoes . Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re iterating that it would be wrong to resume touring without him. On the day of Wright's death, Elton John, while playing a concert in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada dedicated the song Believe to him. On 23 September, Gilmour performed Remember a Day , a Wright composition from Pink Floyd's second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, on a live broadcast of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two as a tribute to Wright. In an interview later on in the show, Gilmour said that Wright had intended to perform with him that day, but that he had texted Gilmour a couple of weeks before his death to advise him that he would not be well enough to attend. Wright's main influence was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of music with a theme, later saying if the words came out like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written . A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen . Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music. In the 1970s, Wright listened to some contemporary progressive rock bands, and particularly liked early Peter Gabriel fronted Genesis. He later asked some of the musicians in Gabriel's solo touring band to play on Broken China. Wright enjoyed playing the organ, and considered the style he used in Pink Floyd to be unique. He played solos in the early part of Floyd's career, frequently using Egyptian scales, such as on Matilda Mother or Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun . His jazz background led to him being interested in free form music, with adherence to tempo being less important. Later, he was more interested in complementing each piece with organ, electric piano or synthesizer as a backing instrument, while still featuring occasional solos. In the early days of the band, Wright dabbled with brass before settling on Farfisa electric organs as his main instrument onstage. He originally owned a single manual Combo Compact model, which was used for early recordings of Interstellar Overdrive , and later upgraded to a dual manual Compact Duo. During the 1960s, Wright relied heavily on his Farfisa fed through a Binson Echorec platter echo, as heard on the Ummagumma live album. On later tours, the instrument was fed through a joystick control allowing the signal to be sent through up to six speakers in an auditorium, which was called the Azimuth Coordinator . Wright stopped using the Farfisa after The Dark Side of the Moon, but revisited it in later years, playing it on Gilmour's On An Island tour. It was recorded for the sessions that eventually became The Endless River. Wright played the piano and Hammond organ in the studio from the start of Pink Floyd's recording career using the Hammond's bass pedals for the closing section of A Saucerful of Secrets . He used a Mellotron in the studio for some tracks, including Ummagumma's Sysyphus and on the Atom Heart Mother suite. For a brief period in 1969, Wright played vibraphone on several of the band's songs and in some live shows, and reintroduced the trombone on Biding My Time . He started using a Hammond organ regularly on stage alongside the Farfisa around 1970 and a grand piano became part of his usual live concert setup when Echoes was added to Pink Floyd's regular set list. All three keyboards are used in the concert film Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii. In the 1970s, Wright began using synthesizers such as the VCS 3, ARP String Ensemble and Minimoog, which were featured on Shine on You Crazy Diamond . Wright wrote the closing part of the track alone, and included a brief extract of the band's early single See Emily Play on the Minimoog towards the end. He used a number of electric pianos during the 1970s, including a Wurlitzer fed through a wah wah pedal on Money and an unaccompanied Rhodes introduction for Sheep on Animals. From the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, including the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for reproducing piano and electric piano sounds. Wright retained the Hammond along with a Leslie speaker, playing it onstage and using it during the Division Bell sessions. Wright was a proficient multi instrumentalist who, in addition to keyboards, also played guitar, flute, cello, trombone, violin, drums, saxophone and bass. Other keyboards that he used in the studio were tack piano, harpsichord, celesta and harmonium, notably on Syd Barrett's solo song Love Song and Chapter 24 .

"Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest section of Millennium Park in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District of the Loop area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The square is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan Avenue. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full sized replica of the semicircle of paired Roman Doric style columns called a peristyle that originally sat in this area of Grant Park, near Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain. Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago's front yard since the mid 19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Today, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The square is a tree lined section of Millennium Park with a large lawn. The area broadcasts free wifi wireless technology. The square has earned a reputation as an outdoor culture spot by hosting a wide range of cultural events such as local and international art and photography exhibitions, as well as occasional live musical performances. This reputation is reminiscent of the earlier neo classical meeting place. When Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley dedicated the square, it was dedicated to the donors, known as the Founders Group, who funded Millennium Park. In 2005, Millennium Park was marked for updates and improvements. Benches were to be added to the 56 original benches. Landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson designed 14 new 320 pound 145.1 kg , aluminum Maggie benches in Millennium Park, mostly in Wrigley square, in honor of Mayor Daley's wife. The square was intended to serve as an exhibit space for outdoor sculpture as well as small cultural performances, according to Christopher Perille, vice president of the Wrigley Square Foundation. The square's peristyle monument is in remembrance of the corporation, foundations, and individuals who made Millennium Park possible. An architectural model of Wrigley Square and Millennium Monument, designed by O'Donnell, Wicklund, Pigozzi and Peterson Architects, Inc. OWP P in 2000, is on display at the Harold Washington Library Center. In 1917, the original peristyle was designed by renowned Chicago planner Edward H. Bennett, who was Daniel Burnham's partner in the Plan of Chicago and who was known for designing the nearby Buckingham Fountain. It was located in Grant Park in the same location as the current Wrigley Square. The original peristyle rose to 40 feet 12.2 m and had a diameter of 100 feet 30.5 m . The original was made of concrete, which did not stand up to the Lake Michigan lakefront weather. In 1953 it was razed to make way for the Grant Park North Garage. The original peristyle was on a promenade with balustrades. A gift from the William Wrigley, Jr. Company, the limestone replica peristyle rises to a height of nearly 40 feet 12.2 m one source says the columns were planned to rise to 36 feet 11.0 m , restoring a classical elegance to Grant Park. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed 5 million to the monument, and the entire square, which cost 5 million to build, was named in its honor. The Millennium Monument is a tribute to the individual, corporate and foundation benefactors of Millennium Park. The pedestal of the peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors including Oprah Winfrey who made the 91 contributions of at least 1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park. The New York Times describes the pedestal as French marble, but other sources mention the use of French limestone. These 115 donors are referred to as the founders of Millennium Park in official park brochures published by the City of Chicago and distributed at the visitor's centers as well as in other press accounts. Their contributions not only paid for the construction of the park, but also provide for its ongoing conservation. The David Dillon and Michael Patrick Sullivan of OWP P design is based on original drawings by Bennett found in the Chicago Park District's archive. The naming rights of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the foundation that created the world's famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed around the same time as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar. The 24 paired, fluted columns are the same height as the original peristyle. However, the structure was scaled down to an 80 foot 24.4 m diameter in order to accommodate the accessible ramp that runs behind the monument. Each of the limestone columns is cut from an Indiana quarry and made of five 2,200 pounds 997.9 kg 157.1 st sections reinforced by steel rods and plates. The fountain in front of the monument is a bronze cast replica of the finials that adorn the Wrigley Building. The brass spout was made from a mold of a terra cotta finail on the Wrigley Building. The front of the monument has a dedication plaque pictured left . In addition, on the reverse side in approximately the same location, the monument has a special plaque commemorating John H. Bryan's contribution as the head of fundraising for the Park. The original model of the Millennium Monument was the starting point of the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once commanding presence that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15 to accommodate a wheel chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a classical take on the original, incorporating a fountain at the base of the limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley%20Square
"Write amplification WA is an undesirable phenomenon associated with flash memory and solid state drives SSDs , where the actual amount of information physically written to the storage media is a multiple of the logical amount intended to be written. Because flash memory must be erased before it can be rewritten, with much coarser granularity of the Erase operation when compared to the Write operation, the process to perform these operations results in moving or rewriting user data and metadata more than once. Thus, rewriting some data requires an already used portion of flash to be read, updated, and written to a new location, together with initially erasing the new location if it was previously used at some point in time. Due to the way flash works, much larger portions of flash must be erased and rewritten than actually required by the amount of new data. This multiplying effect increases the number of writes required over the life of the SSD, which shortens the time it can operate reliably. The increased writes also consume bandwidth to the flash memory,which reduces random Write performance to the SSD. Many factors will affect the WA of an SSD some can be controlled by the user and some are a direct result of the data written to and usage of the SSD. Intel and SiliconSystems acquired by Western Digital in 2009 used the term Write Amplification in their papers and publications as early as 2008. WA is typically measured by the ratio of Writes committed to the flash memory to the Writes coming from the host system. Without compression, WA cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a write amplification of 0.5, with best case values as low as 0.14 in the SF 2281 controller. Due to the nature of flash memory's operation, data cannot be directly overwritten as it can in a hard disk drive. When data is first written to an SSD, the cells all start in an erased state so data can be written directly using pages at a time often 48 kilobytes KB in size . The SSD controller on the SSD, which manages the flash memory and interfaces with the host system, uses a logical to physical mapping system known as logical block addressing LBA and that is part of the flash translation layer FTL . When new data comes in replacing older data already written, the SSD controller will write the new data in a new location and update the logical mapping to point to the new physical location. The data in the old location is no longer valid, and will need to be erased before the location can be written again. Flash memory can be programmed and erased only a limited number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program erase cycles P E cycles it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single level cell SLC flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. As of 2011 , multi level cell MLC flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple level cell TLC e.g., 3D NAND flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program erase P E cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P E cycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life. Write amplification was always present in SSDs before the term was defined, but it was in 2008 that both Intel and SiliconSystems started using the term in their papers and publications. All SSDs have a write amplification value and it is based on both what is currently being written and what was previously written to the SSD. In order to accurately measure the value for a specific SSD, the selected test should be run for enough time to ensure the drive has reached a steady state condition. A simple formula to calculate the write amplification of an SSD is Many factors affect the write amplification of an SSD. The table below lists the primary factors and how they affect the write amplification. For factors that are variable, the table notes if it has a direct relationship or an inverse relationship. For example, as the amount of over provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases inverse relationship . If the factor is a toggle enabled or disabled function then it has either a positive or negative relationship. Data is written to the flash memory in units called pages made up of multiple cells . However, the memory can only be erased in larger units called blocks made up of multiple pages . If the data in some of the pages of the block are no longer needed also called stale pages , only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection GC . All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection is a big part of write amplification on the SSD. Reads do not require an erase of the flash memory, so they are not generally associated with write amplification. In the limited chance of a read disturb error, the data in that block is read and rewritten, but this would not have any material impact on the write amplification of the drive. The process of garbage collection involves reading and rewriting data to the flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of the parts of the block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection BGC , sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle time garbage collection ITGC , where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high. If the controller were to background garbage collect all of the spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade off is that some of those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell the controller this information. The result is that the soon to be deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up only a small number of blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability. In 2010, some manufacturers notably Samsung introduced SSD controllers that extended the concept of BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems operating systems and SATA controller hardware which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systemic data corruption has been reported on these drives if they are not formatted properly using MBR and NTFS. Over provisioning sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning is the difference between the physical capacity of the flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system OS as available for the user. During the garbage collection, wear leveling, and bad block mapping operations on the SSD, the additional space from over provisioning helps lower the write amplification when the controller writes to the flash memory. The first source of over provisioning comes from the computation of the capacity and use of gigabyte GB as the unit instead of gibibyte GiB . Both HDD and SSD vendors use the term GB to represent a decimal GB or 1,000,000,000 109 bytes. Like most other electronic storage, flash memory is assembled in powers of two, so calculating the physical capacity of an SSD would be based on 1,073,741,824 230 per binary GB or GiB. The difference between these two values is 7.37 230 109 109 100 . Therefore, a 128 GB SSD with 0 additional over provisioning would provide 128,000,000,000 bytes to the user out of 137,438,953,472 total . This initial 7.37 is typically not counted in the total over provisioning number, and the true amount available is usually less as some storage space is needed for the controller to keep track of non operating system data such as block status flags. The 7.37 figure may extend to 9.95 in the terabyte range, as manufacturers take advantage of a further grade of binary decimal unit divergence to offer 1 or 2 TB drives of 1000 and 2000 GB capacity 931 and 1862 GiB , respectively, instead of 1024 and 2048 GB as 1 TB 1,000,000,000,000 bytes in decimal terms, but 1,099,511,627,776 in binary . The second source of over provisioning comes from the manufacturer, typically at 0 , 7 or 28 , based on the difference between the decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128 GB based on 128 GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28 , 7 and 0 respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28 of over provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37 of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte. The third source of over provisioning comes from known free space on the drive, gaining endurance and performance at the expense of reporting unused portions, and or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternatively, some SSDs provide a utility that permits the end user to select additional over provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100 of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over provisioning as well. Yet another source of over provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi permanent over provisioning. Over provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance. A simple formula to calculate the over provisioning of an SSD is TRIM is a SATA command that enables the operating system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed as a result of file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file not just remove parts of it , the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection. The introduction of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases , FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs that no longer contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. The result is the SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance. The TRIM command also needs the support of the SSD. If the firmware in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task. Just because an SSD supports the TRIM command does not necessarily mean it will be able to perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command. The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance. Even after the OS and SSD are configured to support the TRIM command, other conditions might prevent any benefit from TRIM. As of early 2010 , databases and RAID systems are not yet TRIM aware and consequently will not know how to pass that information on to the SSD. In those cases the SSD will continue to save and garbage collect those blocks until the OS uses those LBAs for new writes. The actual benefit of the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user capacity on the SSD was 100 GB and the user actually saved 95 GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5 GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, increasing the amount of over provisioning by 5 GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5 GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS. The SSD controller will use any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling. The portion of the user capacity which is free from user data either already TRIMed or never written in the first place will look the same as over provisioning space until the user saves new data to the SSD . If the user saves data consuming only half of the total user capacity of the drive, the other half of the user capacity will look like additional over provisioning as long as the TRIM command is supported in the system . The ATA Secure Erase command is designed to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out of box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best lowest number possible write amplification, but as soon as the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDerase. GParted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase. Drives which encrypt all writes on the fly can implement ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption will physically clear all blocks after that as well, while other drives may require a TRIM command to be sent to the drive to put the drive back to its original out of box state as otherwise their performance may not be maximized . Some drives may either completely or partially fail to erase the data with the ATA Secure Erase, and the data will remain recoverable from such drives. If a particular block was programmed and erased repeatedly without writing to any other blocks, that block would wear out before all the other blocks thereby prematurely ending the life of the SSD. For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called wear leveling to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD. In a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing cold data to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently hot data can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces the life of the flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both. The separation of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification is not a simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting dynamic data from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites static data . If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data which caused the rewrite initially and static data which did not require any rewrite . Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P E cycles. When an SSD is writing large amounts of data sequentially, the write amplification is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, and there is no need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the readerasemodifywrite process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection. The peak random write performance on an SSD is driven by plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100 TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, the efficiency of the firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience. The overall performance of an SSD is dependent upon a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel as channels to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller will be required to write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification. In September 2008, Intel announced the X25 M SATA SSD with a reported WA as low as 1.1. In April 2009, SandForce announced the SF 1000 SSD Processor family with a reported WA of 0.5 which appears to come from some form of data compression. Before this announcement, a write amplification of 1.0 was considered the lowest that could be attained with an SSD.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write%20amplification
"Write Me Back is the eleventh studio album by American R B recording artist R. Kelly, released on June 25, 2012, by RCA Records. It was written and produced primarily by Kelly as the follow up to his 2010 album Love Letter. He recorded Write Me Back at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia. It expands on its predecessor's traditional R B aesthetic and incorporates musical influences such as Philadelphia soul and elements of Chicago stepping. Thematically, the album generally deals with love, its redemptive power, and its complications. The album debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200, selling 68,000 copies in its first week, and ultimately spent 17 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with three singles Share My Love , Feelin' Single and When a Man Lies . Upon its release, Write Me Back received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its music and Kelly's singing. As of August 15, 2012, it has sold 141,300 copies in the United States. At the end of his supporting tour for Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the same vein of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write Me Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia. Write Me Back expands on its predecessor's traditional R B aesthetic with 1970s influences, particularly Philadelphia soul and elements of Chicago stepping. Its title is a reference to that album's title. The music is also characterized by uptempo drum programming and smooth keyboard lines. Nitush Abebe of New York observes frictionless glide and delicacy, all the strings and horns caressing around the margins, of late seventies Philly soul greats and Quincy Jones productions. The album's primary subject matter is love, with exhortations about its redemptive power and its complications. Abebe writes of this theme, There's love as inspiration and redemption, love as strangled by manipulative men or undercommitted women, love as universal party, love as rotted from the inside by apathy or envy. Share My Love is an uptempo song with Philadelphia soul styled strings. It has a pop R B style similar to that of Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall. The song has a theme of romance and tongue in cheek lyrics Populate Let's get together Populate . Green Light has a quiet storm style and low key mood. It is about a man wanting to please a woman who has a negligent boyfriend. Feelin' Single is about the liminal sense of having checked out of a relationship and started looking around for escape routes. Kelly sings in a high register on the song, which Greg Kot views evok the boyish innocence of a Michael Jackson over a stepping dance groove accented with finger snaps. Believe in Me is told from the perspective of a lover about to leave his woman for a prison term and asks for patience and support. Miles Marshall Lewis views that the song embod elements of the oft downtrodden blue collar African American experience. Lady Sunday is a dance oriented, orchestrated song with musical similarities to early 1970s Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. Believe That It's So features disco strings, assertive brass, and a narrative that celebrates love's ability to help people overcome adversity before celebrating celebration in general, as Kelly sings about becoming drunk and needing to draw on love to overcome his impending hangover. Deviating from the album's 1970s influence, All Rounds on Me has rockabilly elements and an alternating blues arrangement. The album was released by RCA Records on June 25, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 26 in the United States. It is his first album for RCA, after RCA Music Group shut down Kelly's former label Jive Records. The album's deluxe edition included four additional songs. The album's lead single, Share My Love , was released on February 1 and became a number one hit on urban adult radio. It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot R B Hip Hop Songs, on which it has charted for 20 weeks. It also charted at number 72 on the Japan Hot 100. The second single, Feelin' Single , was released as a digital download on May 29. It reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot R B Hip Hop Songs. On June 27, Kelly became ill from complications related to his 2011 throat surgery. Consequently, his promotional appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Today were cancelled. Although his status for subsequent promotional efforts was uncertain, Kelly performed at Reggae Sumfest on July 20, and performed on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon after rescheduling for July 23. When a Man Lies later impacted urban adult radio as the album's third and final single on October 15. Write Me Back received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 18 reviews. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it the best grown man dance record of the year and stated, the songwriting is, per usual at this point in his career, nimble and nicely matured. But the arrangements are the centerpiece here. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called its music virtuoso pastiche but Kelly's Seventies are freakier than your dad's. Maura Johnston of The Village Voice viewed Clipped Wings as its strongest track and compared the album to Love Letter, stating it's slightly less drenched in retro tropes, but it's no less of an enjoyable listen. Miles Marshall Lewis of Spin felt that the result distills the melodies and lyrical flair fans love without the NC 17 lines that often make Kelly NSFW. Andy Gill of The Independent found Kelly even more at home musically than on Love Letter and stated, for all his production skills, he remains first and foremost a vocal stylist of considerable ability . Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun Times complimented Kelly's superb voice and noted the Philadelphia soul influence as a much more natural fit for Kelly's considerable vocal gifts and lusty one track mind. Allmusic's Andy Kellman complimented the music's warmth and joy and stated, It's apparent that he can be retro and urbane as instinctively as he can be cutting edge and filthy. Nitsuh Abebe of New York commended Kelly for nailing each voice and narrative and stated, He comes at every idea like an impassioned pro, and whether that idea is making people melt, grind, or titter in disbelief, its usually his ardor thats having that effect. In a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times dubbed the album Kelly's least ambitious and found it tepid by his standards, which is to say, completely technically accomplished, but lacking the snakelike vocal slither and moist subject matter that mark him at his most virtuosic. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson panned its music as this porridge is just right uptempo mush and questioned its genuineness, writing that even if the songs sound like the height of artifice ... there's little doubt believes in his own hollow offerings. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell observed a fine line between breezy and half assed in the songwriting and criticized its cut rate production choices behind Kelly's engaged vocal performances. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it a less consistently strong sequel and stated, Listeners may find themselves toggling between questioning Kellys sincerity and admiring his facility as a producer and singer. Spin ranked Write Me Back number 37 on their list of 2012's best albums. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 80 on the UK Albums Chart in the week of July 7, 2012. In the United States, Write Me Back debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, selling 68,000 copies in its first week. It was Kelly's lowest first week sales since 12 Play in 1993. The album sold 24,600 copies in its second week on the chart, falling 14 spots to number 19. It ultimately charted for 17 weeks on the US Billboard 200. As of August 15, 2012, the album has sold 253,000 copies in the United States. Credits for Write Me Back adapted from liner notes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write%20Me%20Back
"Write on Me is a song by American girl group Fifth Harmony from their sophomore studio album, 7 27 2016 . It was released as the album's second promotional single on May 5, 2016 on iTunes and other digital and streaming services. The song was written by duo Mikkel Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate, Kygo, Priscilla Renea, and Simon Wilcox, with production handled by Eriksen, Hermansen, and Kygo. It is a mid tempo, tropical house number that uses synths, tambourines, an acoustic guitar, and finger snaps as its instrumentation. Critics noted that it had a slower melody from the groups previous songs. Lyrically, the song uses the human body as a metaphor to tell a lover to expose their strengths, flaws, and truths. Inspired by the lack of ballads on their previous records, the group wanted to create more variety and a different atmosphere that their public have not heard before. Write on Me was the last promotional single before the group released their album. Upon availability, the song charted in Czech Republic and Scotland. As part of the track's promotion, the group performed the song for the first time at Wango Tango, two weeks before the album's release. It was subsequently included in The 7 27 Tour. Write on Me was written and co produced by Norwegian duo Mikkel Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate and Kyrre Grvell Dahll with additional writing from Priscilla Renea and Simon Wilcox. Other personnel involved in the production of the song include mixing engineer Phil Tan, mastering engineer Dave Kutch, assistant engineer Daniela Rivera and recording engineers Eriksen, Miles Walker and Mike Anderson. While recording music for their sophomore album, Fifth Harmony was keen in including a ballad number. Cabello told Entertainment Weekly that fans would see more of a vulnerable side to them. This was something that was not very present in their debut album, Reflection 2015 . The song was released on streaming service Spotify and digital music platform iTunes on May 5, 2016. The track was also made available on Google Play the following day. As a tropical house song, Write on Me was noted for having slow melody in comparison to Fifth Harmony's previous works, using synths, tambourines, finger snaps and an acoustic guitar as its foundation. As for Sasha Geffen from MTV News, the song blends acoustic guitar chords with tropical synths , while using a calm instrumentation instead of big beats . Camila Cabello who was member of the group during its release, and Ally Brooke found the track to showcase the group's vulnerability in separate statements. Cabello said that it was her personal favorite song, saying that the track was an extended metaphor where you're asking somebody to 'write' on you, envelop you with their words, make their mark on you like you're a blank canvas. Upon its release, Write on Me generated positive commentaries by music critics who complimented the song's soft tropical production and departure from their previously released songs, for example, Dana Getz of Entertainment Weekly who called the song another bop , noted the slower rhythm of the song in comparison to Work from Home and The Life but mentions the similar anthemic atmosphere all three songs display. Billboard magazine expressed similar statements to Getz, calling the song powerful while also distinguishing the laid back atmosphere from their past single, Work from Home . The article states that each member is allowed their turn in the spotlight, switching off verses on the power jam. Some writers such as Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone, Fuse's Jeff Benjamin and Brennan Carley of Spin acclaimed the song noting its resemblance to Kygo's musical style. Brittany Goldfield Rodrigues from Andpop raved about the song's infectious beat and it's heartfelt lyrics. She further states that the track will give you chills, from the vocals to the lyrics. Echoing the thoughts of Carley, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy called the track one of their most understatedly infectious bops yet, also complementing the group for not having suffered the dreaded second album syndrome, or sophomore slump, where the second album fails to live up to the standards of the first album. On May 14, 2016, Write on Me debuted on UK Singles Charts at its peak position of number 173 and remained on the chart for one week. It also debuted at 92 in Scotland and 79 on Scotland, becoming the group's fifth entry on Scottish charts. The music video was directed by Sam Lecca and premiered on Vevo on 6 May 2016. The video, filmed in black and white, shows the five members of the group singing and dancing to the song. Regarding the video, member Normani Kordei expressed, this is a different approach than we've done before. She stated that the video focuses more on the lyrical content as well as their beauty shots which is a new concept the group explores as there's always so much going on. Brittany Rodrigues of website Andpop, described the video as elegant while Jessica McKiney from Hollywood Life perceived that Fifth Harmony definitely brought the sex appeal in the video, calling as incredibly sexy . It was also called as soulful by Lindsey Barton who writes for Tiger Beat magazine. Teen Vogue's Isis Briones commented that the concept present in the video definitely does the lyrics justice. The video begins with a guitar being strummed in a cartoonish background as each member's white silhouette is shown making dramatic motions. Kordei's silhouette appears as she writes in the air and her form comes to life after drawing a heart on her wrist. After her verse, the camera moves to Cabello dancing. A close up of Lauren Jauregui is then shown with a dark silhouette of Cabello abruptly switching between takes. The scene transitions as multiple thick grey and black rectangular lines move towards the chorus of the song where each member is singing in stools, snapping their fingers with a spotlight on them. Individual takes of the each member are shown. Brooke stares away from the camera, singing to a person who is not visible to the reader. She, similar to Cabello, acts in a sensual way. The guitar in the intro of the video is now in real life form. In a negative special effects, the verse changes to Cabello, who is presented in different takes, including a silhouette, a normal background and a dim mirror image. The scene changes back to where each member was previously in stools, snapping in sync to the beat of the song. As the video progresses, the rhythm intensifies with several individual takes of the group as the grey rectangular boxes slow the beat with a moving background of a sunset and blurry blue lines depicting waves as Cabello's image disappears. Soon after, the group is clustered together dancing, depicting what appears to be a photo booth as the screen flashes several times.

"Writer in the Dark is a song recorded by New Zealand singer songwriter Lorde for her second album Melodrama 2017 . Lorde co wrote and co produced the track with Jack Antonoff. It is a piano ballad with sparse production and an outro. The song was inspired after Lorde woke up late one night with a stranger its lyrics are Lorde's lament to an ex lover, in which she says she will always love him but she also needs to move her life forwards. The song received acclaim from music critics, many of whom commended its songwriting and compared it to that of Taylor Swift and Lorde's vocals to Kate Bush's register. Lorde performed Writer in the Dark and six other songs as part of a re imagined Vevo song series at Electric Lady Studios, where she recorded the song. Writer in the Dark was part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour 20172018 . In an exclusive podcast interview with The Spinoff, Lorde stated that she wrote Writer in the Dark from the perspective of something being finished, but still feeling like I had something I wanted to say . She was also inspired to write the lyric, Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark after she woke late on night in a bed she was sharing with a stranger. In a separate interview, Lorde said Writer in the Dark was the last song she recorded that made the final cut of the album and the second after Supercut in which she was speaking to someone or closing a door . The singer songwriter said about the songwriting process, It's interesting when youre female and you write this confessional, painfully honest music about your life. Theres a lot of guilt associated with that. According to Lorde, the song is her way of saying, It's what I've always been. It's what I was when you met me. It's what I will continue to be after you leave. That's exactly what was going to happen when you kissed a writer in the dark. She noted that the lyrics of the chorus fluctuate in emotion. Lorde also said the writing process felt therapeutic and complex. When asked about writing from a traditionalist perspective, Lorde said she felt she made the song unique by implementing words such as pseudoephedrine , the name of a sympathomimetic drug, which she said would work in a rap song she enjoyed taking standard forms and putting spiky bits on them . The singer also compared Writer in the Dark and Liability 2017 to a rap cadence. Writer in the Dark was co written and co produced by Lorde credited under her birth name Ella Yelich O'Connor and Jack Antonoff. It was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, New York City. The song is composed in the key of G Major with a walking pace tempo of 72 beats per minute while Lorde's vocals span a range of D3 to D5. It is a piano ballad with sparse instrumentation in its production. Its lyrics are Lorde's lament to an ex lover, whom she tells she will always love but she also needs to move forward. Paste writer Emily Reily said the song combines Lordes defiance with her most desperate and exposed moments, showing shell go pretty damn far for love, but will move on when she chooses . The song drew comments on Lorde's vocals, which several publications compared to those of English singer Kate Bush. According to Colin Groundwater from Pretty Much Amazing, Lorde vocals on the line I love you til you call the cops on me stretch to a painfully human falsetto , while Chicago Tribune editor Greg Kot said the singer delivers a resonant line about obsession as she finds a way to tunnel out from the wreckage . Drowned in Sound noted the jolting shift on Writer in the Dark from Lorde's usual semi growl of a delivery to a much more high pitched warble that is one of a handful of moments on this album to recall Kate Bush . Entertainment Weekly stated that Lorde acknowledges the trope of the scorned lover in the song, while No Ripcord said her vocals turn to grief in the lines, I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops . Writer in the Dark received critical acclaim from music critics several publications compared its songwriting to that of Taylor Swift. Stuff.co.nz editor Graeme Tuckett called it one of the highlights from the album, saying, Lorde giving her toughest and least inflected vocal performance in the service of the album's strongest set of lyrics . Alexis Petridis from The Guardian stated that while the song was not the first attempt from a modern female singer songwriter to channel Kate Bush, it may well be the first one that doesnt make you want to die of embarrassment on their behalf the tune is wonderful, her cracked, raw vocal really affecting . Sharing similar sentiments, Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic called the song a wonderful nightmare of a piano piece and concludes by stating that Lorde is saying something thats been said many times before in song, but shes still saying it more interestingly than most people . DIY writer Will Richards called the song flooring, showing her to be one of the most emotionally intelligent pop songwriters around , while NME's Dan Stubbs described it as deliciously bitter . Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared its lyrics to Swift and its aesthetic to Lana Del Rey's, saying it is sometimes sparse and transparent enough to accompany Lordes voice with just a piano note or two .

"The Writing on the Wall is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. Directed by Barry O'Neil from a script by Lloyd Lonergan, this presumed lost film focuses on a young girl named Grace who becomes attracted to a wealthy man named Jack. Two men, named Turner and Hank plot to rob Jack after he withdraws a large sum of money from a bank, but Grace warns him of a plot to drug him. Jack escapes and marries Grace. The film has no known trade publication reviews, but reviews may exist for this film. Theaters were advertising this film as late as 1913. The film is presumed lost, but a surviving synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 11, 1910. It states Turner, a man of bad character, conducts an inn in the country. His stepdaughter Grace is his trudge. When on an errand to the village she meets Jack, wealthy young man. He is much attracted by her. Jack goes to the bank and draws a large sum of money. Hank, a pal of Turner, sees him and tries to ambush him on the road, but fails. Then he goes ahead to tell Turner. Jack, on his trip, meets Grace. Nearly exhausted, he takes her home, and thus seems to play directly into the hands of the villains. They steal his revolver, and would drug him, were it not for the fact that Grace writes a warning on the wall with wine. Jack, aided by Grace, escapes but the girl is wounded. Jack marries Grace. The writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director was Barry O'Neil, the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy. O'Neil would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast for the production is also unknown, but the cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. An article in The Moving Picture World over a botched scene identifies Barry O'Neil as the director who stunned the studio workers. In a critical scene in the film, the two villains bungled the attempt to drug the hero and wound up drinking the drugged drink. O'Neil reportedly called out, Stop You've drank the poison The article was published on May 14, 1910, and gives a loose timetable for when the film was being produced. The single reel drama, approximately 1000 feet in length, was released on June 10, 1910. The film was advertised in the June 11, 1910 edition of Billboard magazine. The film was advertised as late as 1911 in one Indiana theater and as far late as 1913 in a Texas theater. It is unknown if published reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers or the American Film Institute catalogs. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Writing%20on%20the%20Wall%20%28film%29
"Written Chinese Chinese pinyin zhongwen comprises Chinese characters used to represent the Chinese language. Chinese characters do not constitute an alphabet or a compact syllabary. Rather, the writing system is roughly logosyllabic that is, a character generally represents one syllable of spoken Chinese and may be a word on its own or a part of a polysyllabic word. The characters themselves are often composed of parts that may represent physical objects, abstract notions, or pronunciation. Literacy requires the memorization of a great number of characters educated Chinese know about 4,000. The large number of Chinese characters has in part led to the adoption of Western alphabets as an auxiliary means of representing Chinese. Various current Chinese characters have been traced back to the late Shang Dynasty about 12001050 BC, but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun some centuries earlier. After a period of variation and evolution, Chinese characters were standardized under the Qin Dynasty 221206 BC . Over the millennia, these characters have evolved into well developed styles of Chinese calligraphy. As the varieties of Chinese diverged, a situation of diglossia developed, with speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties able to communicate through writing using Classical Chinese. In the early 20th century, Classical Chinese was replaced in this role by written vernacular Chinese, corresponding to the standard spoken language Mandarin . Although most other varieties of Chinese are not written, there are traditions of written Cantonese, written Shanghainese and written Hokkien, among others. Some Chinese characters have been adopted into writing systems of other neighbouring East Asian languages, but are currently used only in Japanese and to a lesser extent in Korean, as Vietnamese is now written using alphabetic script. Written Chinese is not based on an alphabet or a compact syllabary. Instead, Chinese characters are glyphs whose components may depict objects or represent abstract notions. Occasionally a character consists of only one component more commonly two or more components are combined to form more complex characters, using a variety of different principles. The best known exposition of Chinese character composition is the Shuowen Jiezi, compiled by Xu Shen around 120 AD. Since Xu Shen did not have access to Chinese characters in their earliest forms, his analysis cannot always be taken as authoritative. Nonetheless, no later work has supplanted the Shuowen Jiezi in terms of breadth, and it is still relevant to etymological research today. According to the Shuowen Jiezi, Chinese characters are developed on six basic principles. These principles, though popularized by the Shuowen Jiezi, were developed earlier the oldest known mention of them is in the Rites of Zhou, a text from about 150 BC. The first two principles produce simple characters, known as wen The remaining four principles produce complex characters historically called zi although this term is now generally used to refer to all characters, whether simple or complex . Of these four, two construct characters from simpler parts In contrast to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or ideographic language, the vast majority of Chinese characters about 95 of the characters in the Shuowen Jiezi are constructed as either logical aggregates or, more often, phonetic complexes. In fact, some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root. An example is zhu candle now archaic, meaning lampwick , which was originally a pictograph , a character that is now pronounced zhu and means host , or The character huo fire was added to indicate that the meaning is fire related. The last two principles do not produce new written forms Instead, they transfer new meanings to existing forms Chinese characters are written to fit into a square, even when composed of two simpler forms written side by side or top to bottom. In such cases, each form is compressed to fit the entire character into a square. Character components can be further subdivided into strokes. The strokes of Chinese characters fall into eight main categories horizontal , vertical , left falling , right falling , rising lower element of , dot , hook , and turning , , , etc. . There are eight basic rules of stroke order in writing a Chinese character These rules do not strictly apply to every situation and are occasionally violated. Chinese characters conform to a roughly square frame and are not usually linked to one another, so do not have a preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right to left the first column being on the right side of the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks being determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books. In modern times, the familiar Western layout, left to right horizontal Chinese, has become more popular. Similar to Latin letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then top of the page to the bottom. This is used especially in the People's Republic of China mainland China , where the government mandated left to right writing in 1955. The government of the Republic of China Taiwan followed suit in 2004 for official documents. The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows. The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages for example, the double and single quotation marks and the hollow period dot , which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period full stop and a special kind of comma called an enumeration comma , which is used to separate items in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence. Street and shop signs are a particularly challenging aspect of written Chinese layout, since they can be written either left to right, or right to left the latter can be thought of as the traditional layout with each column being one character high , as well as from top to bottom. It is not uncommon to encounter all three orientations on signs on neighboring stores. Chinese is one of the oldest continually used writing systems still in use. The earliest generally accepted examples of Chinese writing date back to the reign of the Shang Dynasty king Wu Ding 12501192 BC . These were divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones, primarily ox scapulae and turtle shells. Characters were carved on the bones in order to frame a question the bones were then heated over a fire and the resulting cracks were interpreted to determine the answer. Such characters are called jiaguwen shell bone script or oracle bone script. In 2003, some 11 isolated symbols carved on tortoise shells were found at Jiahu, an archaeological site in the Henan province of China, some bearing a striking resemblance to certain modern characters, such as mu eye . Since the Jiahu site dates from about 6600 BC, it predates the earliest confirmed Chinese writing by more than 5,000 years. Dr Garman Harbottle, of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, US, who headed a team of archaeologists at the University of Science and Technology of China, in Anhui province, has suggested that these symbols were precursors of Chinese writing, but Professor David Keightley, of the University of California, Berkeley, US whose field of expertise is the origins of Chinese civilization in the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, employing archaeological and inscriptional evidence, suggests that the time gap is too great for a connection. From the late Shang Dynasty, Chinese writing evolved into the form found in cast inscriptions on Chinese ritual bronzes made during the Western Zhou Dynasty c 1066770 BC and the Spring and Autumn period 770476 BC , a kind of writing called jinwen metal script . Jinwen characters are less angular and angularized than the oracle bone script. Later, in the Warring States period 475221 BC , the script became still more regular, and settled on a form, called liuguo wenzi script of the six states , that Xu Shen used as source material in the Shuowen Jiezi. These characters were later embellished and stylized to yield the seal script, which represents the oldest form of Chinese characters still in modern use. They are used principally for signature seals, or chops, which are often used in place of a signature for Chinese documents and artwork. Li Si promulgated the seal script as the standard throughout the empire during the Qin dynasty, then newly unified. Seal script in turn evolved into the other surviving writing styles the first writing style to follow was the clerical script. The development of such a style can be attributed to those of the Qin Dynasty who were seeking to create a convenient form of written characters for daily usage. In general, clerical script characters are flat in appearance, being wider than the seal script, which tends to be taller than it is wide. Compared with the seal script, clerical script characters are strikingly rectilinear. In running script, a semi cursive form, the character elements begin to run into each other, although the characters themselves generally remain separate. Running script eventually evolved into grass script, a fully cursive form, in which the characters are often entirely unrecognizable by their canonical forms. Grass script gives the impression of anarchy in its appearance, and there is indeed considerable freedom on the part of the calligrapher, but this freedom is circumscribed by conventional abbreviations in the forms of the characters. Regular script, a non cursive form, is the most widely recognized script. In regular script, each stroke of each character is clearly drawn out from the others. Even though both the running and grass scripts appear to be derived as semi cursive and cursive variants of regular script, it is in fact the regular script that was the last to develop. Regular script is considered the archetype for Chinese writing and forms the basis for most printed forms. In addition, regular script imposes a stroke order, which must be followed in order for the characters to be written correctly. Strictly speaking, this stroke order applies to the clerical, running, and grass scripts as well, but especially in the running and grass scripts, this order is occasionally deviated from. Thus, for instance, the character mu wood must be written starting with the horizontal stroke, drawn from left to right next, the vertical stroke, from top to bottom next, the left diagonal stroke, from top to bottom and lastly the right diagonal stroke, from top to bottom. In the 20th century, written Chinese divided into two canonical forms, called simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese. Simplified Chinese was developed in mainland China in order to make the characters faster to write especially as some characters had as many as a few dozen strokes and easier to memorize. The People's Republic of China claims that both goals have been achieved, but some external observers disagree. Little systematic study has been conducted on how simplified Chinese has affected the way Chinese people become literate the only studies conducted before it was standardized in mainland China seem to have been statistical ones regarding how many strokes were saved on average in samples of running text. The simplified forms have also been criticized for being inconsistent. For instance, traditional rang allow is simplified to , in which the phonetic on the right side is reduced from 17 strokes to just three. The speech radical on the left has also been simplified. However, the same phonetic is used in its full form, even in simplified Chinese, in such characters as rang soil and nang snuffle these forms remained uncontracted because they were relatively uncommon and would therefore represent a negligible stroke reduction. On the other hand, some simplified forms are simply long standing calligraphic abbreviations, as for example wan ten thousand , for which the traditional Chinese form is . Simplified Chinese is standard in the mainland of China, Singapore and Malaysia. Traditional Chinese is retained in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities except Singapore and Malaysia . Throughout this article, Chinese text is given in both simplified and traditional forms when they differ, with the traditional forms being given first. At the inception of written Chinese, spoken Chinese was monosyllabic that is, Chinese words expressing independent concepts objects, actions, relations, etc. were usually one syllable. Each written character corresponded to one monosyllabic word. The spoken language has since become polysyllabic, but because modern polysyllabic words are usually composed of older monosyllabic words, Chinese characters have always been used to represent individual Chinese syllables. For over two thousand years, the prevailing written standard was a vocabulary and syntax rooted in Chinese as spoken around the time of Confucius about 500 BC , called Classical Chinese, or wenyanwen. Over the centuries, Classical Chinese gradually acquired some of its grammar and character senses from the various dialects. This accretion was generally slow and minor however, by the 20th century, Classical Chinese was distinctly different from any contemporary dialect, and had to be learned separately. Once learned, it was a common medium for communication between people speaking different dialects, many of which were mutually unintelligible by the end of the first millennium AD. A Mandarin speaker might say yi, a Cantonese yat, a Shanghainese iq, and a Hokkien chit, but all four will understand the character to mean one . Chinese languages and dialects vary by not only pronunciation, but also, to a lesser extent, vocabulary and grammar. Modern written Chinese, which replaced Classical Chinese as the written standard as an indirect result of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, is not technically bound to any single variety however, it most nearly represents the vocabulary and syntax of Mandarin, by far the most widespread Chinese dialectal family in terms of both geographical area and number of speakers. This version of written Chinese is called Vernacular Chinese, or baihua literally, plain speech . Despite its ties to the dominant Mandarin language, Vernacular Chinese also permits some communication between people of different dialects, limited by the fact that Vernacular Chinese expressions are often ungrammatical or unidiomatic in non Mandarin dialects. This role may not differ substantially from the role of other linguae francae, such as Latin For those trained in written Chinese, it serves as a common medium for those untrained in it, the graphic nature of the characters is in general no aid to common understanding characters such as one notwithstanding . In this regard, Chinese characters may be considered a large and inefficient phonetic script. However, Ghil'ad Zuckermanns exploration of phono semantic matching in Standard Chinese concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional, conveying both semantic and phonetic content. The variation in vocabulary among dialects has also led to the informal use of dialectal characters , as well as standard characters that are nevertheless considered archaic by today's standards. Cantonese is unique among non Mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard, used in Hong Kong and overseas, with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this language. Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging, although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use Vernacular Chinese. To a lesser degree Hokkien is used in a similar way in Taiwan and elsewhere, although it lacks the level of standardization seen in Cantonese. However, the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China is currently releasing a standard character set for Hokkien, which is to be taught in schools and promoted amongst the general population. Chinese characters were first introduced into Japanese sometime in the first half of the first millennium AD, probably from Chinese products imported into Japan through Korea. At the time, Japanese had no native written system, and Chinese characters were used for the most part to represent Japanese words with the corresponding meanings, rather than similar pronunciations. A notable exception to this rule was the system of man'yogana, which used a small set of Chinese characters to help indicate pronunciation. The man'yogana later developed into the phonetic syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Chinese characters are called hanzi in Mandarin, after the Han Dynasty of China in Japanese, this was pronounced kanji. In modern written Japanese, kanji are used for most nouns, verb stems, and adjective stems, while hiragana are used for grammatical elements and miscellaneous words that have no common kanji rendition katakana are used for transliteration of loanwords from other languages, the names of plants, animals and certain scientific or technical words, onomatopoeia and emphasis. The Joyo kanji, a list of kanji for common use standardized by the Japanese government, contains 2,136 charactersabout half the number of characters commanded by literate Chinese. The role of Chinese characters in Korean and Vietnamese is much more limited. At one time, many Chinese characters called hanja were introduced into Korean for their meaning, just as in Japanese. Today, Korean is written almost exclusively using the Hangul alphabet with a small number of Chinese characters. Each square block character contains Hangul symbols, or letters, that together represent a syllable. Similarly, the use of Chinese and Chinese styled characters in the Vietnamese chu nom script has been almost entirely superseded by the Latin based Vietnamese alphabet. Chinese characters are still actively used in South Korea today, mostly for signs, newspapers, books, and government documents. Chinese characters are also used within China to write non Han languages. The largest non Han group in China, the Zhuang, have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people can read the Zhuang logograms than the alphabetic script. Over the history of written Chinese, a variety of media have been used for writing. They include Since at least the Han dynasty, such media have been used to create hanging scrolls and handscrolls. Because the majority of modern Chinese words contain more than one character, there are at least two measuring sticks for Chinese literacy the number of characters known, and the number of words known. John DeFrancis, in the introduction to his Advanced Chinese Reader, estimates that a typical Chinese college graduate recognizes 4,000 to 5,000 characters, and 40,000 to 60,000 words. Jerry Norman, in Chinese, places the number of characters somewhat lower, at 3,000 to 4,000. These counts are complicated by the tangled development of Chinese characters. In many cases, a single character came to be written in multiple ways. This development was restrained to an extent by the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty, but soon started again. Although the Shuowen Jiezi lists 10,516 characters9,353 of them unique some of which may already have been out of use by the time it was compiled plus 1,163 graphic variantsthe Jiyun of the Northern Song Dynasty, compiled less than a thousand years later in 1039, contains 53,525 characters, most of them graphic variants. Written Chinese is not based on an alphabet or syllabary, so Chinese dictionaries, as well as dictionaries that define Chinese characters in other languages, cannot easily be alphabetized or otherwise lexically ordered, as English dictionaries are. The need to arrange Chinese characters in order to permit efficient lookup has given rise to a considerable variety of ways to organize and index the characters. A traditional mechanism is the method of radicals, which uses a set of character roots. These roots, or radicals, generally but imperfectly align with the parts used to compose characters by means of logical aggregation and phonetic complex. A canonical set of 214 radicals was developed during the rule of the Kangxi Emperor around the year 1700 these are sometimes called the Kangxi radicals. The radicals are ordered first by stroke count that is, the number of strokes required to write the radical within a given stroke count, the radicals also have a prescribed order. Every Chinese character falls sometimes arbitrarily or incorrectly under the heading of exactly one of these 214 radicals. In many cases, the radicals are themselves characters, which naturally come first under their own heading. All other characters under a given radical are ordered by the stroke count of the character. Usually, however, there are still many characters with a given stroke count under a given radical. At this point, characters are not given in any recognizable order the user must locate the character by going through all the characters with that stroke count, typically listed for convenience at the top of the page on which they occur. Because the method of radicals is applied only to the written character, one need not know how to pronounce a character before looking it up the entry, once located, usually gives the pronunciation. However, it is not always easy to identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical. Accordingly, dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters, indexed by total stroke count, near the beginning of the dictionary. Some dictionaries include almost one seventh of all characters in this list. Other methods of organization exist, often in an attempt to address the shortcomings of the radical method, but are less common. For instance, it is common for a dictionary ordered principally by the Kangxi radicals to have an auxiliary index by pronunciation, expressed typically in either hanyu pinyin or zhuyin fuhao. This index points to the page in the main dictionary where the desired character can be found. Other methods use only the structure of the characters, such as the four corner method, in which characters are indexed according to the kinds of strokes located nearest the four corners hence the name of the method , or the Cangjie method, in which characters are broken down into a set of 24 basic components. Neither the four corner method nor the Cangjie method requires the user to identify the proper radical, although many strokes or components have alternate forms, which must be memorized in order to use these methods effectively. The availability of computerized Chinese dictionaries now makes it possible to look characters up by any of the indexing schemes described, thereby shortening the search process. Chinese characters do not reliably indicate their pronunciation, even for one dialect. It is therefore useful to be able to transliterate a dialect of Chinese into the Latin alphabet or the Perso Arabic script Xiao'erjing for those who cannot read Chinese characters. However, transliteration was not always considered merely a way to record the sounds of any particular dialect of Chinese it was once also considered a potential replacement for the Chinese characters. This was first prominently proposed during the May Fourth Movement, and it gained further support with the victory of the Communists in 1949. Immediately afterward, the mainland government began two parallel programs relating to written Chinese. One was the development of an alphabetic script for Mandarin, which was spoken by about two thirds of the Chinese population the other was the simplification of the traditional charactersa process that would eventually lead to simplified Chinese. The latter was not viewed as an impediment to the former rather, it would ease the transition toward the exclusive use of an alphabetic or at least phonetic script. By 1958, however, priority was given officially to simplified Chinese a phonetic script, hanyu pinyin, had been developed, but its deployment to the exclusion of simplified characters was pushed off to some distant future date. The association between pinyin and Mandarin, as opposed to other dialects, may have contributed to this deferment. It seems unlikely that pinyin will supplant Chinese characters anytime soon as the sole means of representing Chinese. Pinyin uses the Latin alphabet, along with a few diacritical marks, to represent the sounds of Mandarin in standard pronunciation. For the most part, pinyin uses vowel and consonant letters as they are used in Romance languages and also in IPA . However, although 'b' and 'p', for instance, represent the voice unvoiced distinction in some languages, such as French, they represent the unaspirated aspirated distinction in Mandarin Mandarin has few voiced consonants. Also, the pinyin spellings for a few consonant sounds are markedly different from their spellings in other languages that use the Latin alphabet for instance, pinyin 'q' and 'x' sound similar to English 'ch' and 'sh', respectively. Pinyin is not the sole transliteration scheme for Mandarinthere are also, for instance, the zhuyin fuhao, Wade Giles, and Gwoyeu Romatzyh systemsbut it is dominant in the Chinese speaking world. All transliterations in this article use the pinyin system.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written%20Chinese

I think that it's really fun. It's always fun to have Georgina around. She justs stirs the pot in a major way. She sort of threads through all the major stories ... sort of like a witness until she injects herself. And of course, returning to Constance, you can't return without Georgina. ... So a lot of things are in play and a lot of things are happening ... , since we've never done a two parter before, we wanted to load the gun with as many bullets as possible. Following her role in Green Lantern, news surfaced of Blake Lively leaving the show to further her acting career in Hollywood. IOL notes Despite all talk of career trajectories and fanbase, Blake insists her choices are made through far simpler criteria and when asked about playing in a comic book film says 'Its not really a suitable question because the decisions I make on parts come from a more emotional place. It has to be a character I connect with or someone I can have empathy with.' New York Magazine and various media periodicals have also noted the possibility of Lively leaving the show.

The Wrong Goodbye received positive reviews from critics and garnered an audience of 1.36 million viewers. New York Magazine drew out the references from past seasons and commented on how the season finale was written. The Last Episode of the Fourth Season of the Greatest Show of Our Time felt in many ways like it might have been written to end the series, what with the many This Is Your Life moments such as the return of Georgina Sparks and Blair's old minions Izzy and Kati , the wry references to episodes past, the wrapping up of story lines including the revelation that Dan has been secretly novelizing his observations of the Upper East Side for the entire time we've thought we've known him , and the meaningful departure of its most marketable star to none other than Hollywood. Critical praise went to the storyline twist behind Charlie's identity, citing her as the big shocker of the Gossip Girl finale and the cameo appearance of Gossip Girl author, Cecily von Ziegesar. Television Without Pity included the episode in its gallery of Season Finales 2011 The Best and Worst , declaring the finale as one of the best and stating that it had a lot of storylines pay off and was our own little version of a fairy tale. Television Without Pity and Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic praised the return of Georgina, stating Michelle had some of the show's funniest dialogue in a long time. She and Jack Bass have really made the last two weeks for me. It was great to have her back. When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it Quite the cliffhanger to leave us with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining. The show went out on a high note and next season could be even better. New York Magazine commented on the pregnancy test, insisting that were pretending that positive pregnancy test didnt exist. The Los Angeles Times' Judy Berman praised the finale, stating ... this year went out with a bang. I had my doubts and reservations, largely concerning Blair and Chuck, but I am surprised and pleased to report that I found the end of Gossip Girl Season 4 both exciting and satisfying. The return of Georgina Sparks was well received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision making skills leave something to be desired Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into old habits next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment. Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel ... it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out. Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever . New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the Longest Delayed Breakup of the season, adding that the big news was that Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps. We feel comfortable assuming that by then, Chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Wrong%20Goodbye%20%28Gossip%20Girl%29
"The Eurasian wryneck Jynx torquilla is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family. This species mainly breeds in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian Subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards. Eurasian wrynecks measure about 16.5 cm 6.5 in in length and have bills shorter and less dagger like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white as is the case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June. These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a jinx on someone. The Eurasian wryneck was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758. The type species came from Sweden. The genus name Jynx is from the Ancient Greek name for this bird, iunx. The specific torquilla is Medieval Latin derived from torquere, to twist, referring to the strange snake head movements. The bird was used as a charm to bring back an errant lover, the bird being tied to a piece of string and whirled around. The English wryneck refers to the same twisting movement and was first recorded in 1585. The family Picidae has four subfamilies, the Picinae woodpeckers , the Picumninae piculets , the Jynginae wrynecks and the monotypic Nesoctitinae Antillean piculet . Based on morphology and behaviour, the Picumninae was considered to be the sister clade of the Picinae. This has now been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and the Jynginae are placed basal to the Picinae, Nesoctitinae and Picumninae. Jynginae includes one genus Jynx and two species, the Eurasian wryneck and the red throated wryneck Jynx ruficollis , resident in sub Saharan Africa. There are six subspecies of Jynx torquilla The Eurasian wryneck grows to about 17 cm 6.7 in in length. The subspecies Jynx torquilla tschusii weighs 26 to 50 g 0.92 to 1.76 oz . It is a slim, elongated looking bird with a body shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker. The upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. The rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown. The rounded tail is grey, speckled with brown, with faint bands of greyish brown and a few more clearly defined bands of brownish black. The cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown. The underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow heads which are reduced to spots on the lower breast and belly. The flanks are buff with similar markings and the under tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars. The primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous buff markings. The beak is brown, long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip. The irises are hazel and the slender legs and feet are pale brown. The first and second toes are shorter than the others. The first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces. The call of the Eurasian wryneck is a series of repeated harsh, shrill notes quee quee quee quee lasting for several seconds and is reminiscent of the voice of the lesser spotted woodpecker. Its alarm call is a short series of staccato tuck s and when disturbed on the nest it hisses. The Eurasian wryneck has a palearctic distribution. The breeding range of the nominate subspecies includes all of Europe from Britain to the Urals. In the north it reaches the Arctic Circle and the range includes Spain in the southwest. In the south and east it intergrades with J. t. tschusii smaller and more reddish brown which is found in Corsica, Italy, Dalmatia and parts of the Balkans. J. t. mauretanica also smaller than the nominate form, light, with whitish throat and breast is resident in Algeria and Morocco and possibly also the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and parts of Sicily. J. t. sarudnyi considerably paler than the nominate with fainter markings occurs in the Urals and then in a wide strip of Asia through southern Siberia, Central Asia, including the north western Himalayas to the Pacific coast. J. t. chinensis breeds in eastern Siberia and northeastern and central China while J. t. himalayana breeds in Pakistan and the northwestern Himalayas. Eurasian wrynecks also inhabit the island of Sakhalin, Japan and the coastal areas of southern China. The Eurasian wryneck is the only European woodpecker to undertake long distance migrations. The wintering area of European species is located south of the Sahara, in a wide strip across Africa extending from Senegal, Gambia and Sierra Leone in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Its southern limit extends to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The populations from West Asia use the same wintering areas. The Central and East Asian breeding birds winter in the Indian subcontinent or southern East Asia including southern Japan. During the summer the bird is found in open countryside, parkland, gardens, orchards, heaths and hedgerows, especially where there are some old trees. It may also inhabit deciduous woodland and in Scandinavia it also occurs in coniferous forests. The Eurasian wryneck sometimes forms small groups during migration and in its winter quarters but in the summer is usually found in pairs. It characteristically holds its head high with its beak pointing slightly upwards. A mutual display that occurs at any time of year involves two birds perched facing each other with their heads far back and beaks wide open, bobbing their heads up and down. Sometimes the head is allowed to slump sideways and hang limply. On other occasions, when excited, the head is shaken and twisted about violently. When disturbed on the nest or held in the hand, the neck contorts and twists in all directions. The bird sometimes feigns death and hangs limply with eyes closed. On returning to the breeding area after migration, the birds set up territories. On farmland in Switzerland it has been found that old pear orchards with large numbers of ant nests are preferentially selected over other habitats. Areas used for vegetable cultivation provided useful habitat when they include areas of bare ground on which the birds can forage. Territories are not chosen at random as arriving birds favoured certain areas over others with the same territories being colonised first year after year. The presence of other Eurasian wrynecks in the vicinity is also a positive influence. Orchards in general, and older ones in particular, provide favoured territories, probably because the dense foliage is more likely to support high numbers of aphids and the ground beneath has scant vegetation cover, both of which factors increase the availability of ants, the birds' main prey. Despite some territories being consistently chosen over others, reproductive success in these territories was no higher than in others. Limiting factors for such crevice nesting species as Eurasian wrynecks are both the availability of nesting sites and the number of ants and their ease of discovery. Modern farming practices such as the removal of hedges, forest patches and isolated trees and the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are disadvantageous to such birds. The diet of the Eurasian wryneck consists chiefly of ants but beetles and their larvae, moths, spiders and woodlice are also eaten. Although much time is spent in the upper branches of trees, the bird sometimes perches in low bushes and mostly forages on the ground, moving around with short hops with its tail held in a raised position. It can cling to tree trunks, often moving obliquely, and sometimes pressing its tail against the surface as a prop. It does not make holes in bark with its beak but picks up prey with a rapid extension and retraction of its tongue and it sometimes catches insects while on the wing. Its flight is rather slow and undulating. The nesting site is variable and may be in a pre existing hole in a tree trunk, a crevice in a wall, a hole in a bank, a sand martin's burrow or a nesting box. In its search for a safe, protected site out of reach of predators, it sometimes evicts a previous occupant, its eggs and nestlings. It uses no nesting material and a clutch of normally seven to ten eggs is laid occasionally five, six, eleven or twelve . The eggs average 20.8 by 15.4 millimetres 0.82 in 0.61 in and weigh about 0.2 g 0.007 oz . They are a dull white colour and partially opaque. Both sexes are involved in incubation which takes twelve days, but the female plays the greater part. Both parents feed the chicks for about twenty days before they fledge. There is usually a single brood. The IUCN lists the Eurasian wryneck as being of Least Concern in its Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it has a world population estimated at up to fifteen million individual birds and a very wide geographical range. The population may be decreasing to a certain extent but not at such a rate as to make the bird reach the threshold for a more threatened category. In continental Europe, the largest populations are in Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Belarus and Ukraine, and only in Romania is the population trend believed to be upward. In Russia, where there are believed to be 300,000 to 800,000 individuals, the population trend is unknown. In the United Kingdom the numbers of bird are on the decrease and it is protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention. It is protected as a migratory species under the Birds Directive in the European Union. In Switzerland, the population has also been decreasing, but the species has reacted positively to conservation measures such as the addition of nestboxes in suitable habitats.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian%20wryneck
"WSJ. or WSJ. Magazine, which was originally intended to be a monthly magazine named Pursuits, is a luxury glossy news and lifestyle monthly magazine by the publishers of The Wall Street Journal. It features luxury consumer products advertisements and is distributed to subscribers in large United States markets as well as throughout Europe and Asia. Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Kristina ONeill is Editor in Chief and Anthony Cenname is Publisher. Launched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014. The magazine is distributed within the U.S. Weekend Edition of The Wall Street Journal newspaper paid print circulation for the Weekend edition is 2.2 million , the European and Asian editions, and is available on WSJ.com. Each issue is also available throughout the month in The Wall Street Journals iPad app. With its tagline The Luxury of Choice , the magazine began operations with an advertising business model that allowed for free delivery to select readers. It followed a trend of contemporaneous new luxury magazines many of which were also delivered as part of free subscriptions that supplemented other subscriptions or memberships. Since it is leveraging a high end subset of The Wall Street Journal with favorable demographics, many expected the magazine to be successful. The magazine was originally sent as an insert with September 6, 2008 weekend home delivery in the seventeen largest United States The Wall Street Journal subscription markets as well as the September 5 editions of the Wall Street Journal Europe and Wall Street Journal Asia. By selecting these markets, it began with a readership of 960,000 800,000 domestic . The magazine is also available with newsstand purchases of the newspaper in the selected domestic markets, and its content is available for free online at www.wsj.com. In addition, this readership has greater wealth average household assets of US 2.9 million , higher income 265,000 per household income , and takes more than twice as many international leisure trips than the readership of the newspaper. This is notable because the readership of the newspaper spent more on women's apparel than the readers of Vogue and more on leisure travel than the readers of Travel Leisure. The launch press release was sent in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. The September 6 debut had been announced nearly a year earlier. The magazine was officially unveiled at the Pierpont Morgan Library on September 3, 2008. The unveiling was led by Ellen Asmodeo Giglio, its publisher Michael Rooney, Dow Jones chief revenue officer Tina Gaudoin, WSJ. editor in chief and former launch editor of The Times of Londons Luxx and Robert J. Thomson, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. It has been compared to How To Spend It, the weekend magazine of the Financial Times, T magazine, a New York Times offshoot, Style Design, a spinoff of Time, and Departures, a magazine distributed for free to American Express platinum and black cardholders. Gaudoin had also previously worked for Tatler, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue and helped to launch the women's magazine Frank. In 2008, luxury magazines had become the new wave of print media. These aforementioned similar magazines have generally succeeded at both giving free luxury magazine subscriptions to a selected elite audience and hoping that they would read them so that the magazine could sell advertising. This magazine is considered to be a similar bet on the viability for the luxury advertising revenues market. Nearly half of the advertiser bought globally in the United States, Europe and Asia and many advertisers committed to advertising deals for all of next year. Some advertisers committed for two years. The Wall Street Journal launched its weekend newspaper edition, which its publisher, Dow Jones Company, described as the first and only Saturday morning national weekend newspaper, on September 17, 2005. When the weekend newspaper was launched, it had the highest circulation of any national newspaper published on Saturday. Prior to the launch of the weekend edition, The Wall Street Journal had commonly only been delivered to business addresses. With the home delivery aspect of the weekend edition, the possibility of supplemental weekend luxury magazine arose. The original name Pursuits had been widely publicized as a section of the newly launched weekend edition of the magazine. In December 2009, WSJ. announced plans to expand domestic circulation beyond the 17 largest domestic markets to the entire domestic subscription base, which nearly doubled its domestic circulation from 800,000 to 1.5 million. In addition the frequency of distribution was expanded from 4 to 6 times per year. In order to increase the frequency a May and an October edition were added to the March, June, September and December 2010 distribution schedule. At the time of the expansion, the magazine claimed its first fifteen months of its first six issues had been a success during which the magazine attracted 64 new subscribers to the Journal's franchise. Deborah Needleman replaced Tina Gaudoin in 2010. After Needleman left for T in 2012, she was replaced by Kristina ONeill. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, the magazine increased its publication frequency to 10, 11 and 12 times per year, respectively. When Pursuits initially was marketed, the plan was for it to be a monthly magazine. The magazine is oversized to be as large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal. Its specs are 9.875 by 11.5 inches 25.1 by 29.2 cm trim size and a 50 50 ad to edit ratio on a 60 pound 27 kg paper stock. The premiere issue of WSJ. had 104 pages in the U.S. and 80 pages in the Europe and Asia editions. It included 51 advertisers of which 19 are new to The Wall Street Journal franchise. The initial cover featured Diana Dondoe in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design, which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue. Some media experts consider that pursuit of luxury retail advertising an effective strategy, but whether the magazine becomes a success is an open issue. Immediate speculation commented on the likelihood for success given the demographics of the initial subscription base. Others ascribed their great expectations to the brand. Some skeptics claim that since Journal readers are financial information seekers giving them a free magazine of luxury ads may be a waste of time. Others note the magazine's launch despite a market with declining advertising and a world economy suffering from the Financial crisis of 20072008. Some advertisers expressed appreciation for an opportunity to present to The Wall Street Journal's readers in a different format. The content is slightly less focussed on consumption than How To Spend It. Gaudoin stated her intention was to make a publication that was less about how to spend it and more about how to live it. She also intends to differentiate her magazine via wit and irreverence in order to make WSJ. less urban and less gritty than T. The magazine claims to have planned to feature Sarah Palin in its inaugural issue even before she became John McCain's running mate in the 2008 United States presidential election. In 2013, Adweek named WSJ. Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year for its annual Hot List. The November 2013 cover featuring Gisele Bundchen and Daft Punk won the Clio Award for Top Magazine cover of the year.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSJ.
"WTC Cortlandt, additionally signed as World Trade Center on walls and formerly known as Cortlandt Street and Cortlandt StreetWorld Trade Center, is a station on the IRT BroadwaySeventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway in Lower Manhattan. The station is located under the intersection of Greenwich Street and Cortlandt Way within the World Trade Center. It is served by the 1 train at all times. The original Cortlandt Street station was built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company IRT and opened in 1918. The station was renovated in the 1960s when the original World Trade Center was built. Around that time, the portion of Cortlandt Street above the station was demolished to make way for the World Trade Center. The Cortlandt Street station was destroyed on September 11, 2001. Although service on the BroadwaySeventh Avenue Line through the area was restored in 2002, the station's reconstruction was delayed until 2015 because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had to first rebuild the World Trade Center PATH station beneath it. After an extensive reconstruction, the Cortlandt Street station reopened on September 8, 2018, as WTC Cortlandt. The station contains connections to the PATH at the World Trade Center station, as well as an out of system passageway to the Fulton Center subway complex via the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were dual in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 4, the IRT agreed to build a branch of the original subway line south down Seventh Avenue, Varick Street, and West Broadway to serve the West Side of Manhattan. The construction of this line, in conjunction with the construction of the Lexington Avenue Line, would change the operations of the IRT system. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turning onto 42nd Street, before finally turning onto Park Avenue, there would be two trunk lines connected by the 42nd Street Shuttle. The system would be changed from looking like a Z system on a map to an H system. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway. In order for the line to continue down Varick Street and West Broadway, these streets needed to be widened, and two new streets were built, the Seventh Avenue Extension and the Varick Street Extension. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Lower West Side, and to neighborhoods such as Chelsea and Greenwich Village. The Cortlandt Street station opened as the line was extended south to South Ferry from 34th StreetPenn Station on July 1, 1918, and was served by a shuttle. The new H system was implemented on August 1, 1918, joining the two halves of the BroadwaySeventh Avenue Line and sending all West Side trains south from Times Square. An immediate result of the switch was the need to transfer using the 42nd Street Shuttle. The completion of the H system doubled the capacity of the IRT system. In 1965, Cortlandt Street west of Church Street was demolished to create the superblock of the World Trade Center. The station, with entrances at Vesey Street and inside the World Trade Center concourse, was separated from the remaining block of Cortlandt Street. In 1965 and 1966, the platforms were extended to accommodate ten car trains. The old tiling and mosaics were removed and replaced with the 1970s style varnished, tan colored brick tiles. One of the Vickers mosaics was preserved in the New York Transit Museum. During the 1980s, when service levels across the subway system were decreased greatly from their heyday in the 1910s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority installed the system's first train frequency schedules at the Cortlandt Street station. Older timetables and maps elsewhere had been removed since they had become inaccurate. Trains bypassed the station in the aftermath of the February 26, 1993, World Trade Center bombing. Soon after, 1 trains were back to Chambers Street. In 2001, just prior to the September 11 attacks, the Cortlandt Street station saw 19,446 riders per day. 8C 3 The station and the surrounding subway tunnels were severely damaged in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks from the collapse of Two World Trade Center, resulting in the closure of the line south of Chambers Street. The steel I beams of the station were crumpled and the station roof collapsed, as the tunnel had been located 40 feet 12 m underground, relatively close to ground level. Soon after the attacks, two options were considered either the existing line would be repaired, or the tunnel would be diverted westward just to the north of the World Trade Center site before heading to a new terminal at South Ferry. The first option was chosen, and to quickly restore service to Rector Street and South Ferry stations to the south, workers demolished the remainder of the station and built walls where the platforms used to be. 975 feet 297 m of tunnels and trackage, including 575 feet 175 m of totally destroyed tunnels and tracks in the vicinity of the station site as it traversed Ground Zero, were entirely rebuilt. However, officials wanted only to reopen Rector and South Ferry stations at the time, and the Cortlandt Street station was to be closed completely, with no replacement. Eventually, it was decided that the Cortlandt Street station was to be rebuilt as part of the greater World Trade Center reconstruction project since the station was such a vital one in the area, a permanent closure was infeasible. As part of the project, the East Bathtub was extended under the line to the eastern boundary of the site at Church Street. George Pataki, who was the governor of New York at the time, stated, This is going to help more than a million people by restoring service, help the recovery of lower Manhattan and sends a powerful message that New York City can't be stopped. The Port Authority's chief engineer and others tried to convince him to temporarily shut down the line while the new transportation hub at the World Trade Center was under construction. The Governor's decision to keep the line open increased the cost of the project because the subway structure had to be underpinned. The line reopened on September 15, 2002, with trains bypassing the site of the Cortlandt Street station. The northern entrance at Vesey Street was under a staircase to the plaza above. After the World Trade Center collapse on September 11, the staircase still stood and became known as the Survivors' Staircase. The stairs were moved into the National September 11 Museum in July 2008. In 2007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey PANYNJ , in the Environmental Impact Statement for the World Trade Center PATH terminal, expected the Cortlandt Street station to reopen in 2009. 8C 16 In October 2008, the PANYNJ stated in a report that it had come to an agreement with the MTA on reconstructing the Cortlandt Street station. The MTA would pay the Port Authority to rebuild the station as part of the Port Authority's World Trade Center Transportation Hub contract, in order to make the construction process more efficient. 50 The Port Authority was set to complete underpinning and excavation under the tunnel structure by the second quarter of 2010, and start basic construction of the Cortlandt Street station during the 3rd quarter. 50 In the second quarter report for 2010, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed that excavation under the tunnel structure of the World Trade Center site was nearly complete, and that construction of the Cortlandt Street station would begin during the third quarter of 2010. Station finishes were set to start during the second quarter of 2011, 50 and work began on the station mezzanine and platforms in September 2011. The tracks were walled off for the protection of the workers while the construction progressed. From 2008 to 2011, the 1 train used an enclosed structure for a short distance when passing the site of the station, as a result of the massive excavation in the World Trade Center site. When the site was filled back in, the developers of the new World Trade Center rebuilt Cortlandt Street across the site as one of the primary roads, resulting in the rebuilt Cortlandt Street station again serving its namesake. Disputes between the PANYNJ and the MTA over who would pay for the renovation had caused the planned opening of the station to be delayed from 2014 to 2018. In 2013, the PANYNJ awarded a contract to rebuild the station. The first phase of the demolition of the original station cost 19 million. The area was still being rebuilt in December 2013, and in February 2015, the PANYNJ and the MTA agreed to finish the station. The part of the BroadwaySeventh Avenue Line on which the Cortlandt Street station is located, south of Chambers Street, was intermittently closed between May 2015 and 2018. This allowed construction at the station, which included station finishes, tiles and lighting, to resume. The MTA gained control of the Cortlandt Street station's reconstruction project in 2015. However, in January 2017, an independent engineer for the MTA said that the station's reopening could potentially be pushed back due to disagreements with station contractor Judlau Contracting. At that time, the MTA had spent 800,000 per month on the project, but it would need to spend four times as much money in order to meet the projected August 2018 deadline. The PANYNJ agreed to grant the MTA full access to the Cortlandt Street station in June 2017 once the temporary World Trade Center PATH entrance was demolished and the station's foundation was poured. The renovation included new Americans with Disabilities Act compliant entrances with elevators, track intrusion systems, fire alarms, Help Points, CCTV cameras, countdown clocks and air conditioning. A 1 million text based marble mural by Ann Hamilton was installed in the station. By September 2017, much of the communications, power, and ventilation infrastructure was being installed, but contractor work and Port Authority utility relocation were significantly delayed. According to the MTA's Capital Program Oversight Committee, the contractor had to more than double its productivity to ensure an October 2018 opening, with substantial completion in December 2018. In April 2018, several news sources affirmed the possible reopening date of October 2018. By June, the station wiring was complete, architectural finishes and turnstiles were being installed, and elevators and escalators were being installed. Station name signs with the text World Trade Center were being installed along the platform walls by August 2018. The reconstruction of the station ultimately cost 181 million, up from earlier projections of 158 million and 101 million. At that point, the television station WCBS TV estimated that over a million trains had passed through the station without stopping. On September 7, 2018, several news sources reported that the station would reopen the next day in time for the seventeenth anniversary of the attacks. The following day, the station indeed reopened with a ceremony. A new name, WTC Cortlandt , was chosen for the station because of its location under World Trade Center, in addition to paying homage to its historic name of Cortlandt Street. However, work on the station had yet to be complete. As of September 2018 , the MTA still had to complete the art on the northbound platform's wall, replace temporary ceilings, floodproof the station, and complete the north end of the station. The MTA projected that the work would be substantially complete by the end of December 2018. 10 As of July 2019 , the station's reconstruction was 95 complete but some work remained to be done. 122 The original station was built at the intersection of Cortlandt and Greenwich Streets, in a part of Lower Manhattan nicknamed Radio Row because of the many electronics dealers on the street. It had a standard two side platform layout with two tracks. Prior to the station's first renovation in 1965, there were mosaic decorations by Squire J. Vickers depicting ships along each platform's wall. Red i beam columns ran along the entire length of both platforms at regular intervals with every other column having the standard black station name plate in white lettering the name plates alternated between Cortlandt Street and World Trade Center . The rebuilt station is located under Greenwich Street, at the same location as the original station. It retains the two track, two side platform layout, and is 20 feet 6.1 m below the ground level. There are columns between the tracks, except where the station passes over the World Trade Center Transportation Hub toward its north end. There is also a crossunder between the two platforms at the north end of the station, north of the hub. The platforms feature gray i beam columns with signs reading WTC Cortlandt on every other column. World Trade Center name signs are installed on the station's walls. There is a crossunder between the two platforms at the north end of the station. The station also contains an air conditioning system. The 2018 artwork in this station is CHORUS, a 1 million, 4,350 square foot 404 m2 weaving based artwork by Ann Hamilton. This artwork features words from several documents, including from the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and United States Declaration of Independence, embossed onto the station walls. The rebuilt station is connected to the Chambers StreetWorld Trade Center Park Place Cortlandt Street and World Trade Center PATH stations within the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. The WTC Cortlandt station is located just west to the World Trade Center Hub's head house, which is known as the Oculus . There are a total of four entrances from the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. Two mezzanines underneath the tracks, at the north and south ends of the station, give direct access from the subway to the PATH. The northern mezzanine contains access to both platforms, while the southern mezzanine only connects to the southbound platform. There are additional entrances to the uptown platform from the Oculus building's upper balcony, as well as from the South Concourse, which connects to the basement of 3 World Trade Center. There is an out of system connection to the Fulton Center via the WTC Hub. The southbound platform has two direct exits to the street. The first is an elevator and stair at Vesey Street at the platform's extreme north end, and the second is a pair of staircases to Cortlandt Way at the station's extreme south end. The station is ADA accessible via the elevator at Vesey Street, as well as existing elevators to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. Additional elevators lead from each platform to the crossunder beneath the station. Prior to 9 11, the station's full time entrance was located at the north end of the station at Vesey Street and West Broadway, where there was a turnstile bank and one full height turnstile. The token booth at this exit was still intact until the last remnants of the station were removed in 2007. The entrance to the World Trade Center Concourse consisted of full height turnstiles at the center of each platform and was only open on weekdays between 6 40 a.m. and 10 p.m. At the station's southern end, there was an exit to Liberty Street through Four World Trade Center.

"WTF is the seventeenth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on April 26, 2011, on KMFDM Records and Metropolis Records. The regular line up of Sascha Konietzko, Lucia Cifarelli, Jules Hodgson, Andy Selway, and Steve White was joined by a handful of musicians from other industrial and alternative metal acts. The album took about twice as long as usual for the band to produce, and underwent a significant amount of modification during its recording. WTF reached No. 8 on Billboard's Dance Electronic Albums chart. Its first single, Krank , hit No. 15 on the Billboard Singles chart, while its second, Amnesia , hit No. 3 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Critics were generally very positive about the album, and while some felt the album was relatively creative, most felt it stayed close to the same formula the band had used for years. Band leader Sascha Konietzko first mentioned a new album that would feature a slew of guest musicians in March 2010. Former collaborator Bill Rieflin returned to help with WTF , and Koichi Fukuda also added guitar work. William Wilson, who had previously performed vocals on Day of Light , and Free Dominguez, of the group Kidneythieves, were brought in as guest vocalists for one song apiece. In an interview in September 2010, Konietzko said the new album would be named Zilch. A remixed version of Rebels in Control was made available on the band's website in December 2010 as a show of support for WikiLeaks editor in chief Julian Assange, and was streamed more than 75,000 times in two days. The name of the forthcoming album was also revealed to have been changed to WTF around the same time. Konietzko explained in an April 2011 interview that the album had taken fourteen months to complete, about twice as long as usual. He said that everything on the album went through a grinder, was then re constituted and went through a whole process of re birthing yet once again , adding that every single component of the album was redone at least once. Konietzko also commented before the album's release that due to the significant time difference between his location Hamburg, Germany and the rest of the band on the United States west coast , I take my rest and they work, so it's like we get two full work days in a 24 hour frame. The song Panzerfaust marks the first time the band has written a song with Italian lyrics, and is a translation of Liebeslied from the band's 1990 album Naive. The song Death and Burial of C.R. is lyrically based on the English nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin . The song Vive La Mort includes the lyrics aces and eights , a reference to Wild Bill Hickok's last hand. The concept for the album cover was conceived jointly by Konietzko and longtime band associate and cover artist Aidan Brute Hughes. Hughes stated that he achieved an appearance similar to the angelic look of Renaissance paintings of the Madonna with the artwork. The album's first single, Krank , was released March 8, 2011, and debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Singles Chart. WTF was released on April 26, 2012, and reached No. 8 on Billboard's Dance Electronic Albums chart on May 14, 2011. It also debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic Album chart. The song Amnesia was released as a single on May 22, 2012. It peaked at No. 3 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts in mid July. The band toured North America in support of the album in August 2011, with Wilson accompanying the band as a guest vocalist. A longer tour of Europe took place in October and November. WTF received very positive reviews, with critics split over whether the album broke new ground compared to previous releases. Some felt the album explored new musical territory. Trey Spencer of Sputnikmusic praised the album and the band's creativity, saying KMFDM had stepped outside of their comfort zone by... opening up to a little experimentation. William Dashiell Hammett of COMA Music Magazine was strongly complimentary, saying, The level of musicianship and creativity shown on this album is breathtaking. Most critics felt KMFDM stayed close to its usual sound on WTF . David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF He went on to say the album was an outstanding blast of dark dancefloor destruction and saying the album should be on the top shelf . Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't break new creative ground on WTF , which he said wasn't the heaviest, fastest or most experimental album , it was still rock solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments . Ilker Yucel of ReGen Magazine called WTF a hard hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual . He concluded his review by saying, In short, its KMFDM by the numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all. Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, WTF is typical electronic used to augment electric to over human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd person . He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist. Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF a solid release bursting with power and determination . She also said of KMFDM, musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is not a bad thing . All tracks are written by Sascha Konietzko unless otherwise indicated. All credits come from 2011 liner notes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTF%3F%21
"Chien Shiung Wu simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin Wu Jianxiong May 31, 1912 February 16, 1997 was a Chinese American experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics. Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium into uranium 235 and uranium 238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics, while Wu herself was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978. Her expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie. Her nicknames include the First Lady of Physics , the Chinese Madame Curie and the Queen of Nuclear Research . Chien Shiung Wu was born in the town of Liuhe in Taicang, Jiangsu province, China, on May 31, 1912, the second of three children of Wu Zhong Yi and Fan Fu Hua. The family custom was that children of this generation had Chien as the first character generation name of their forename, followed by the characters in the phrase Ying Shiung Hao Jie, which means heroes and outstanding figures . Accordingly, she had an older brother, Chien Ying, and a younger brother, Chien Hao. Wu and her father were extremely close, and he encouraged her interests passionately, creating an environment where she was surrounded by books, magazines, and newspapers. Wu received her elementary school education at Ming De School, a school for girls founded by her father. She left her hometown in 1923 at the age of 11 to go to the Suzhou Women's Normal School No. 2. This was a boarding school with classes for teacher training as well as for regular high school. Admission to teacher training was more competitive, as it did not charge for tuition or board and guaranteed a job on graduation. Although her family could have afforded to pay, Wu chose the more competitive option and was ranked ninth among around 10,000 applicants. In 1929, Wu graduated at the top of her class and was admitted to National Central University in Nanjing. According to government regulations of the time, teacher training college students wanting to move on to universities needed to serve as schoolteachers for one year. In Wu's case, this was only nominally enforced. She went to teach at a public school in Shanghai, the president of which was the philosopher Hu Shih, whose class she took. From 1930 to 1934, Wu studied at National Central University later renamed Nanjing University and reinstated in Taiwan , first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected as one of the student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since she was one of the top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai shek. For two years after graduation, she did graduate level study in physics and worked as an assistant at Zhejiang University. She became a researcher at the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica. Her supervisor was Gu Jing Wei, who had earned her PhD abroad at University of Michigan and encouraged Wu to do the same. Wu was accepted by University of Michigan, and her uncle, Wu Zhou Zhi, provided the necessary funds. She embarked for the United States with a female friend, Dong Ruo Fen , a chemist from Taicang, on the SS President Hoover in August 1936. Her parents and uncle saw her off. She would never see her parents again. The two women arrived in San Francisco, where Wu's plans for graduate study changed after visiting the University of California, Berkeley. She met physicist Luke Chia Liu Yuan, a grandson of Yuan Shikai the first President of the Republic of China and self proclaimed Emperor of China . Yuan showed her the Radiation Laboratory, where the director was Ernest O. Lawrence, who would soon win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron particle accelerator. Wu heard that at Michigan women were not even allowed to use the front entrance, and decided that she would prefer to study at Berkeley. Yuan took her to see Raymond T. Birge, the head of the physics department, and he offered Wu a place in the graduate school despite the fact that the academic year had already commenced. Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech. Wu made rapid progress in her education and her research. Although Lawrence was officially her supervisor, she also worked closely with Emilio Segre. Her thesis had two separate parts. The first was on bremsstrahlung, the electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. She investigated this using beta emitting phosphorus 32, a radioactive isotope easily produced in the cyclotron that Lawrence and his brother John H. Lawrence were evaluating for use in cancer treatment and as a radioactive tracer. This marked Wu's first work with beta decay, a subject on which she would become an authority. The second part of the thesis was about the production of radioactive isotopes of xenon produced by the nuclear fission of uranium with the 37 inch and 60 inch cyclotrons at the Radiation Laboratory. Wu completed her PhD in June 1940, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, the US academic honor society. In spite of Lawrence and Segre's recommendations, she could not secure a faculty position at a university, so she remained at the Radiation Laboratory as a post doctoral fellow. Wu and Yuan were married at the home of Robert Millikan, Yuan's academic supervisor and the President of Caltech, on May 30, 1942. Neither the bride's nor the groom's families were able to attend due to the outbreak of the Pacific War. Wu and Yuan moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Wu became a faculty member at Smith College, a private women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts, while Yuan worked on radar for RCA. She found the job frustrating, as her duties involved teaching only, and there was no opportunity for research. She appealed to Lawrence, who wrote letters of recommendation to a number of universities. Smith responded by making Wu an associate professor and increasing her salary. She accepted a job from Princeton University in New Jersey as an instructor for naval officers. In March 1944, Wu joined the Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials SAM Laboratories at Columbia University. She lived in a dormitory there, returning to Princeton on the weekends. The role of the SAM Laboratories, headed by Harold Urey, was to support the Manhattan Project's gaseous diffusion K 25 program for uranium enrichment. Wu worked alongside James Rainwater in a group led by William W. Havens, Jr., whose task was to develop radiation detector instrumentation. In September 1944, Wu was contacted by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon 135, with a half life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segre then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon 135 was indeed the culprit it turned out to have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross section. After the end of the war in August 1945, Wu accepted an offer of a position as an associate research professor at Columbia. Communication with China was restored, and Wu received a letter from her family, but plans to visit China were disrupted by the Chinese Civil War, and the birth in 1947 of a son, Vincent Yuan , who would grow up to become a physicist like his parents. In 1949, Yuan joined the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the family moved to Long Island. After the communists came to power in China that year, Wu's father wrote urging her not to return. Since her passport had been issued by the Kuomintang government, she found it difficult to travel abroad. This eventually led to her decision to become a US citizen in 1954. She would remain at Columbia for the rest of her career. She became an associate professor in 1952, a full professor in 1958, and the Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973. Her students called her the Dragon Lady, after the character of that name in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates. In her post war research, Wu continued to investigate beta decay. Enrico Fermi had published his theory of beta decay in 1934, but an experiment by Luis Walter Alvarez had produced results at variance with the theory. Wu set out to repeat the experiment and verify the result. She suspected that the problem was that a thick and uneven film of copper II sulfate CuSO4 was being used as a copper 64 beta ray source, which was causing the emitted electrons to lose energy. To get around this, she adapted an older form of spectrometer, a solenoidal spectrometer. She added detergent to the copper sulphate to produce a thin and even film. She was then able to demonstrate that the discrepancies observed were the result of experimental error her results were consistent with Fermi's theory. At Columbia, Wu knew the Chinese born theoretical physicist Tsung Dao Lee personally. In the mid 1950s, Lee and another Chinese theoretical physicist, Chen Ning Yang, grew to question a hypothetical law of elementary particle physics, the law of conservation of parity . One example highlighting the problem was the puzzle of the theta and tau particles, two apparently different charged, strange mesons. They were so similar that they would ordinarily be considered to be the same particle but different decay modes resulting in two different parity states were observed, suggesting that and were different particles, if parity is conserved Lee and Yang's research into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions and for the strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that it would also be true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil and paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment. Wu chose to do this by taking a sample of radioactive cobalt 60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt 60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed to reduce the amount of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to almost zero. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt 60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments. Lee and Yang's theoretical calculations predicted that the beta particles from the cobalt 60 atoms would be emitted asymmetrically and the hypothetical law of conservation of parity was invalid. Wu's experiment showed that this is indeed the case parity is not conserved under the weak nuclear interactions. and are indeed the same particle, which is today known as a kaon, K . This result was soon confirmed by her colleagues at Columbia University in different experiments, and as soon as all of these results were publishedin two different research papers in the same issue of the same physics journalthe results were also confirmed at many other laboratories and in many different experiments. The discovery of parity violation was a major contribution to particle physics and the development of the Standard Model. In recognition of their theoretical work, Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1957. Wu's role in the discovery was not publicly honored until 1978, when she was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize. In 1963, Wu experimentally demonstrated a universal form of Fermi's beta decay model, confirming the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis of Richard Feynman and Murray Gell Mann on the road to the Standard Model. Her demonstration that parity was not conserved brought other assumptions that physicists had made about the weak interaction into question. If parity is not conserved in weak force interaction, what about charge conjugation This was an effect that held true for electromagnetism, gravity and the strong interaction, so it had been assumed that it would hold for the weak interaction too. Wu conducted a series of experiments on double beta decay in a salt mine under Lake Erie that proved that charge conjugation was not conserved either. Another important experiment carried out by Wu was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant to a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein Podolsky Rosen EPR paradox. Wu's results confirmed E.M.L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle cell disease. She also did research on magnetism and the Mossbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with Steven Moszkowski , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966 and became a standard reference on the subject. Wu's older brother died in 1958, her father in 1959 and her mother in 1962. The United States State Department had imposed severe restrictions on travel to Communist countries by its citizens, so she was not permitted to visit mainland China to attend their funerals. She saw her uncle, Wu Zhou Zhi, and younger brother, Wu Chien Hao, on a trip to Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, relations between the two countries improved, and she was able to visit China again in 1973. By this time her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Zhou Enlai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China several times. In later life, Wu became more outspoken. She protested the imprisonment in Taiwan of relatives of physicist Kerson Huang in 1959 and of the journalist Lei Chen in 1960. In 1964, she spoke out against gender discrimination at a symposium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I wonder, she asked her audience, whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment. When men referred to her as Professor Yuan, she immediately corrected them and told them that she was Professor Wu. In 1975, Robert Serber, the new chairman of the Physics Department at Columbia University, adjusted her pay to make it equal to that of her male counterparts. She also protested the crackdown in China that followed the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. Wu retired in 1981 and became a professor emerita. She died on February 16, 1997, in New York City at the age of 84 after suffering a stroke. An ambulance rushed her to St. Luke'sRoosevelt Hospital Center, but she was pronounced dead on arrival. She was survived by her husband and son. In accordance with her wishes, her ashes were buried in the courtyard of the Ming De School that her father had founded and she had attended as a girl.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung%20Wu
"Wu Zhonghua Chinese 27 July 1917 19 September 1992 , also known as Chung Hua Wu, was a Chinese physicist. He was a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA researcher, Tsinghua University professor, and Founding Director of the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS . He pioneered the general theory of three dimensional flow for turbomachinery, which has been widely used in aircraft engine designs. Wu and his wife Li Minhua were both academicians of the CAS. Born in Shanghai, Wu's college education at Tsinghua University was interrupted by the Second Sino Japanese War. He graduated from the temporary National Southwestern Associated University and was awarded a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. After earning his Ph.D., he joined the NACA, the predecessor of NASA, where he developed the theory of three dimensional flow. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Wu and his wife returned to China in 1954. He established China's first turbomachinery program at Tsinghua and developed a nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to improve computational accuracy. After suffering setbacks during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, his research resumed in the 1970s. In 1980, he became the Founding Director of the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the CAS. Wu was born on 27 July 1917 in Shanghai, with his ancestral home in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. He attended Shanghai Gezhi High School until age 16, before moving to Nanjing and graduating from Jinling High School. In 1935, he entered the Department of Mechanics of Tsinghua University in Beiping now Beijing . After the Second Sino Japanese War broke out in 1937, the university evacuated Beiping and moved south to Changsha, Hunan Province. Together with other students of Tsinghua's mechanics department, he received a year of military training at the newly established Army Mechanized Force School in Hunan. When the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Hunan, his university was forced to evacuate again to Kunming in southwest China, where Tsinghua and several other exiled universities combined their diminished resources to form the temporary National Southwestern Associated University Lianda . Wu resumed his studies at Lianda, and was hired as a faculty member after graduating in 1940. In 1943, he married Li Minhua, a fellow alumna and physicist at Lianda. In late 1943, Wu won Tsinghua University's Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study in the United States. He and his wife were both accepted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as Ph.D. students and began their studies in 1944. He specialized in the internal combustion engine. Li gave birth to two sons in the US, and the couple took turns taking classes and looking after the children. Wu earned his Ph.D. in 1947, and Li hers a year later. They both joined the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics after graduation. In 1950, he pioneered the three dimensional flow theory, which was considered by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as one of the two most important breakthroughs of the 1950s in the development of turbomachinery, together with the invention of computers. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Sino American relations turned openly hostile, and Wu and Li decided they could no longer work for the US military. They resigned from NACA and became professors at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1951. In 1954, they resolved to return to China. To avoid suspicion of the US government, the family flew to Britain in August for vacation, and travelled to China through Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, arriving at the end of the year. In Beijing, Wu was appointed professor and deputy head of the Mechanics Department of Tsinghua University, and established China's first turbomachinery program at Tsinghua in 1956. The following year, he established a research lab in turboengines and internal combustion at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS . He was elected as an academician of the CAS in 1957. When the University of Science and Technology of China was established in 1958, he served as the head of the Department of Physics and Thermal Engineering. Because of his outspoken criticism of the Great Leap Forward, he was denounced in 1958 as a right leaning academic. He was politically rehabilitated the following year and appointed Deputy Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the CAS in 1960. His research program was among the many cancelled during the Great Famine. In the ensuing Socialist Education Movement, he was sent to perform manual work in rural Hongtong County in Shanxi for three years. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Wu was protected by Premier Zhou Enlai and PLA Air Force officers who valued his scientific contributions. He survived the turmoil unscathed, but his research was completely stopped until 1971, when the initial chaos of the revolution subsided. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the normalization of Sino American relations in 1979, Wu led a group of Chinese scientists to visit the United States for the first time since he returned to China in 1954. In 1980, the CAS established the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics IET , with Wu as its founding director. Wu won the State Natural Science Award Second Class in 1957 and 1982. He was awarded the Major Discovery Prize by the CAS in 1975, and the Gold Award from the China Mechanical Engineering Association. From 1981 to 1992, he served as an executive chairman of the CAS. He was elected to the Standing Committee of the 6th and 7th National People's Congress, and served from 1983 until his death in 1992. While working at NACA in 1950, Wu published the paper A general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines of axial , radial , and mixed flow types , which pioneered the three dimensional flow theory. He reduced three dimensional flow problems to problems of iterating two solutions of two independent variables. The relaxation or direct matrix method was used for subsonic flows and the method of characteristics for supersonic flows. In the 1960s, he developed a body fitted, nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to improve computational accuracy. At the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, he and his colleagues developed shock fitting and artificial compressibility methods for solutions in two and three dimensional transonic flows. Wu's theories have been widely used in the designs of aircraft engines, including the Teledyne CAE J69, Pratt Whitney JT3D, Rolls Royce Spey, Rolls Royce RB211, Pratt Whitney JT9D, and the General Electric F404. Wu retired in June 1987. He was diagnosed with liver cancer soon afterwards, and was successfully treated by Dr. Wu Mengchao in Shanghai. In 1990, Wu and Li were invited to teach at Clemson University for four months, and he gave a series of lectures at the NASA Lewis Research Center. In 1992, Wu's cancer relapsed and metastasized to his lungs. He was hospitalized in August, and died on 19 September 1992 in Beijing, at the age of 75. Soon after his death, NASA published Report 4496 1993 on his general theory of turbomachinery. He had reviewed the final draft of the manuscript while in hospital. On his 90th birthday in 2007, the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics established the Wu Zhonghua Scholarship Fund in his memory, which rewards outstanding graduate students and researchers in engineering thermophysics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%20Zhonghua
"Wu Zuguang Chinese WadeGiles Wu Tsu kuang 21 April 1917 9 April 2003 was a Chinese playwright, film director and social critic who has been called a legendary figure in Chinese art and literary circles . He authored more than 40 plays and film scripts, including the patriotic drama City of Phoenix, one of the most influential plays during the Second Sino Japanese War, and Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. He directed The Soul of the Nation, Hong Kong's first colour film, based on his own historical drama Song of Righteousness. He was also well known as an outspoken critic of China's cultural policies, both of the Kuomintang KMT and the Communist governments, and was repeatedly persecuted as a result. He fled to Hong Kong in 1945 to avoid being captured by KMT agents, and returned to Beijing after the foundation of the People's Republic China in 1949. He was denounced as a rightist during the Anti Rightist Campaign and performed hard labour in the Great Northern Wilderness for three years, and was again persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. His wife, the celebrated pingju actress Xin Fengxia, refused to divorce him and became disabled after undergoing beatings and penal labour. Despite these ordeals, Wu continued to criticize government censorship and to call for political freedom, and was widely admired for his moral conviction. Wu was born on 21 April 1917 to a prominent scholar official family in Beijing, with ancestral roots in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. His grandfather Wu Zhiying was a muliao of the Qing dynasty reformer Zhang Zhidong and participated in the Xinhai Revolution. His father Wu Ying was a founder and curator of the Beijing Palace Museum. His mother Zhou Qinqi gave birth to 15 children, 11 of whom four sons and seven daughters survived to adulthood. She gave birth to Wu Zuguang, her first child, in the mansion of Wu Ying's uncle Zhuang Yunkuan, a minister of the Republic of China government. In 1935, Wu entered Sino French University in Beijing. The next year, a relative who was running a drama school in Nanjing persuaded him to move there and teach at his school. There he met several people who would become prominent dramatists, including Cao Yu and Chen Zhice. At the outset of the Second Sino Japanese War in 1937, Wu wrote the patriotic war play City of Phoenix , which made him well known in China at age 20. It was one of the most performed dramas during the eight year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement. As eastern China fell to the Japanese, he moved to the wartime capital Chongqing, where he worked as an editor for the Xinmin Wanbao newspaper. In 1945, he published Mao Zedong's now famous poem Snow to the Tune of Garden in Full Spring , which infuriated the Kuomintang government. He escaped to British Hong Kong to avoid being captured by KMT agents, and made a living writing screenplays and making films. He directed The Soul of the Nation , Hong Kong's first colour film, based on his historical drama, Song of Righteousness, about the Song dynasty patriot Wen Tianxiang. He also made Return on a Snowy Night into a film, as well as two others. In 1946, Wu married the actress Lu En in Shanghai. After the Communist Party of China won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wu returned to Beijing. Like many intellectuals at the time, he held high hopes for the new People's Republic which finally restored peace in a united China after decades of war and division. He wanted to return to writing plays, but was assigned by the government to direct Song of the Red Flag, a film about women textile workers. As he had no experience with factory life, it took him a year to finish the film, which he considered a worthless failure. He and Lu En divorced amicably in 1950, due to differences in personality and interests. In 1951, his friend Lao She introduced him to the famous pingju opera performer Xin Fengxia, who had acted in one of Wu's plays and admired his talent. They married that year, despite the fact that they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. During this period he made the Peking opera film Goddess of the Luo River and Mei Lanfang and His Stage Art, a documentary about Mei Lanfang. He also wrote the Peking operas Three Beatings of Tao Sanchun and San Guan Yan . During Mao Zedong's Anti Rightist Campaign, Wu was denounced as a rightist in 1957 and sent to the Great Northern Wilderness in Heilongjiang to be reformed through labour. His crime was to criticize the Communist Party's control of the theatre and to argue that the neihang experts should have a greater role in such matters. He was called an enemy of the Party, even by his renowned colleague Tian Han. Tian later referenced Wu's work approvingly, which is seen by some as an implicit apology, and was himself persecuted to death. Xin Fengxia was pressured to divorce him, but refused. Citing a legendary love story from one of her operas, she said Wang Baochuan waited 18 years for Xue Pinggui, and I will wait 28 years for Wu Zuguang. As a result, she was herself labeled a rightist and went through struggle sessions. Wu returned to Beijing after three years of hard labour, but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced at the beginning of the period. She became disabled below her left knee after a severe beating. Their friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. During the tumultuous decade Wu and Xin both served years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke, and Wu took care of her for the rest of her life. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Wu was politically rehabilitated in 1980 and inducted into the Communist Party, an event he described as neither an occasion for laughter or tears , and his publication ban was lifted after two decades. His play Itinerant Players , based on Xin Fengxia's experiences, was performed that year. In 1983, Wu traveled to the University of Iowa in the U.S. to attend the International Writing Program. Wu was in general loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but continued to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay at a meeting of the China Writers Association entitled Against Those Who Wield the Scissorsa Plea for an End to Censorship . It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed acrimonious . After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was the sort of person who should be in the Party. In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting. Xin Fengxia died on 12 April 1998, during a trip to Changzhou, Wu's ancestral hometown. He was devastated by the loss and his health quickly deteriorated. He suffered three strokes in the next few years, and died on 9 April 2003. Wu Zuguang and Xin Fengxia had three children. Their son Wu Huan is also a writer, painter, and calligrapher. After the deaths of Wu Zuguang, he organized the exhibition A Hundred Years of the Wu Family at the Poly Art Museum in Beijing. It was also held in France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%20Zuguang
"Wuffa or Uffa, Old English uffa is recorded in the Anglo Saxon genealogies as an early king of East Anglia. If historical, he would have flourished in the 6th century. By tradition Wuffa was named as the son of Wehha and the father of Tytila, but it is not known with any certainty that Wuffa was an actual historical figure. The name Wuffa was the eponym for the Wuffingas dynasty, the ruling royal family of the East Angles until 749. Bede regarded Wuffa as the first king of the East Angles, but the author of the Historia Brittonum, writing a century later, named Wehha as the first ruler. The kingdom of the East Angles was an independent and long lived Anglo Saxon kingdom that was established after migrants arrived in southeast Suffolk from the area now known as Jutland. Rainbird Clarke identified Wehha as one of the leaders of the new arrivals the East Angles are tentatively identified with the Geats of the Old English poem Beowulf. Historians have used sources such as the Anglian collection too as an aid in calculating a date for the establishment of the kingdom. Collingwood and Myers note the use of literacy sources and archaeological finds as evidence of how the region was settled during and after the 5th century, when various disparate groups arrived in Norfolk and Suffolk from different parts of the coast and the rivers of the Fens. The kingdom of the East Angles was bordered to the north and east by the North Sea, to the south by mainly impenetrable forests and by the Fens marshes on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been a corridor, along which ran the prehistoric Icknield Way. The Devil's Dyke near modern Newmarket may have at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but its construction cannot be dated accurately enough to establish it as of Anglo Saxon origin. According to the East Anglian dynastic tally in the Anglian collection, Wuffa was the son of Wehha and the father of Tytila. His name, which is a diminutive form of the Old English word for wolf, is the eponym for his dynasty, the Wuffingas, which taken literally, means 'the kin of Wuffa' . It has been suggested that Wuffa and his dynasty may possibly have originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Warni Wuffa has been identified with the 'King of the Angli', as depicted by the Byzantine scholar Procopius. According to Procopius, a 6th century Warni prince called Radigis was betrothed to the sister of the 'King of the Angli'. The historian Michael Wood has suggested that before the arrival of Wuffa's dynasty in Britain, it had been founded by some powerful and important warrior that was of an ancient royal line. According to the 13th century chronicler Roger of Wendover, Wuffa ruled from 571 to 578, but the origin of this information is unknown. According to Michael Wood, current evidence suggests that Wuffa ruled the East Angles around 575. Bede named Wuffa as the grandfather of Rdwald, from whom the East Anglian kings are called Wuffingas , but Bede's view that Wuffa was the first King of the East Angles is contradicted by the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which instead apparently names a person called Guillem Guercha. In the Historia Brittonum, Guillem Guercha is listed as part of a long pedigree Woden begat Casser, who begat Titinon, who begat Trigil, who begat Rodmunt, who begat Rippa, who begat Guillem Guercha, who was the first king of the East Angles. Guercha begat Uffa, who begat Tytillus, who begat Eni, who begat Edric, who begat Aldwulf, who begat Elric. The 19th century historian Sir Francis Palgrave confused matters when he stated that Guercha is a distortion of the name Uffa, or Wuffa, arising in the first instance from the pronunciation of the British writer, and in the next place from the error of the transcriber . D. P. Kirby has however concluded that Nennius intended to mean that it was Wehha, and not Wuffa, who was the earliest Wuffingas king. A lack of documentary evidence prevents scholars from knowing if Wuffa is anything more than a legendary figure and the true identity of the first East Anglian king cannot be known with certainty. The historian Martin Carver has argued that Wuffa is best regarded as an emblematic figure personified from royal origin myth . It is believed that Wuffa founded the Suffolk village of Ufford, which is commonly translated as Uffa's Ford . Later East Anglian kings claimed their right to rule by being descended from Wuffa, in the same way that the Kentish kings claimed descent from Oisc.

"The Wujing Zongyao Chinese , sometimes rendered in English as the Complete Essentials for the Military Classics, is a Chinese military compendium written from around 1040 to 1044. The book was compiled during the Northern Song dynasty by Zeng Gongliang , Ding Du and Yang Weide , whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The compendium was published under the auspices of Emperor Renzong of Song, who also authored the book's preface. The book covers a wide range of subjects, including everything from naval warships to different types of catapults. It contains the earliest known written chemical formulas for gunpowder, made from saltpeter, sulphur and charcoal along with many added ingredients. In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium also contains details on various other gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows, incendiary bombs and projectiles, and grenades and smoke bombs. It also describes an early form of the compass using thermoremanence , and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese Greek fire flamethrower with a double action dual piston cylinder pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame. The Wujing Zongyao was compiled under the sponsorship of Emperor Renzong of Song r. 10221063 AD , , who was concerned that many officials were unfamiliar with the military classics, and partially as a response to the Song dynasty's war with the Tanguts of Western Xia. A team of scholars worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao with the intent to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it to a wider government audience. Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the astronomer Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du. After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself. Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, implying that the Wujing Zongyao was likely written for other government officials. Parts of the Wujing Zongyao were copied from older sources historian Ralph D. Sawyer calls it essentially a cut and paste job , containing many passages from earlier classical military writings whose original authors are left unidentified, a common practice at the time. During the Song dynasty, the Wujing Zongyao was appended to two other books the Xingjun xuzhi and the Baizhan qifa, both written by anonymous authors. The Wujing Zongyao was one of 347 military treatises listed in the biographical chapters of the History of Song 1345 AD , one of the Twenty Four Histories. Of these 347 different military treatises from the Song period, only the Wujing Zongyao, the Huqianjing Tiger Seal Manual of Xu Dong in 1004 AD, and fragments of similar works found in the later Yonglo Datian, have survived. The original text of the Wujing Zongyao was kept in the Imperial Library while a number of hand written copies were distributed elsewhere, including a copy given to Wang Shao by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1069 AD. The original copy of the Wujing Zongyao was lost during the JinSong wars when the invading Jurchens sacked the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng in 1126 AD. Only a few manuscripts survived as a result of its secretive nature. Very few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands. A remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty 13681644 AD , another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material. After the Wujing Zongyao of 1510 was printed, other Ming copies were made. This included the Jiajing edition 15221566 AD , the Wanli edition 15731619 AD of Quanzhou, and the Wanli edition 15731619 of Jinling by Tang Xinyun preserved by Cunjingge . During the Qing Dynasty 16441911 AD it was also reprinted in two different editions during the 18th century, and again in 1934 with the Shanghai edition. The Xu Wujing Zongyao literally Continuation of Wujing Zongyao is a continuation of the Wujing Zongyao written in the late Ming dynasty. The book focuses primarily on army formations and military deployments. It was written by Fan Jingwen 15871644 , who was then the Vice President of the Board of War bingbu shangshu . Fan wrote the book because he felt that reprints of the Wujing Zongyao circulating at that time were out of date and did not take into account the technological and strategic changes that had occurred since the Song dynasty. The only surviving copy of the Xu Wujing Zongyao is held by Fudan University Library. In the 3rd century, the Chinese engineer Ma Jun invented the south pointing chariot. This was a wheeled vehicle that employed differential gearing in order to lock a figurine of an immortal in place on the end of a long wooden staff, the figure having its arm stretched out and always pointing to the southern cardinal direction. Although the authors of the Wujing Zongyao were mistaken in believing that the design of the south pointing chariot was not handed down as it was reinvented during the Song period and combined with an odometer , they described a new device which allowed one to navigate. This was the 'south pointing fish' a thermoremanence compass , essentially a heated iron or preferably steel object cut in the shape of a fish and suspended in a bowl of water. The Wujing Zongyao part 1 volume 15 text stated When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished, they let an old horse go on before to lead them, or else they made use of the south pointing carriage, or the south pointing fish to identify the directions. Now the carriage method has not been handed down, but in the fish method a thin leaf of iron is cut into the shape of a fish two inches long and half an inch broad, having a pointed head and tail. This is then heated in a charcoal fire, and when it has become thoroughly red hot, it is taken out by the head with iron tongs and placed so that its tail points due north. In this position it is quenched with water in a basin, so that its tail is submerged for several tenths of an inch. It is then kept in a tightly closed box. To use it, a small bowl filled with water is set up in a windless place, and the fish is laid as flat as possible upon the water surface so that it floats, whereupon its head will point south. Later on in the Song dynasty the compass was used with maritime navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo 10311095 AD wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book Dream Pool Essays 1088 AD . With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use. The later maritime author Zhu Yu wrote of the magnetic needle compass as a means to navigate at sea in his Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD. The Wujing Zongyao's illustrated descriptions of warships had a significant influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the Wubei Zhi from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the Wujing Zongyao. The use of pictures from the Wujing Zongyao would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's Ka i Tsusho ko Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's Wakan Senyoshu Collected Studies on the Ships used by the Chinese and Japanese in 1766. The Wujing Zongyao divides Chinese warships into six categories Tower ships lou chuan , combat or war junks dou xian or zhan xian , covered swoopers meng chong , flying barques zou ge , patrol boats you ting , and sea hawk ships hai hu . The Wujing Zongyao's typology for classifying Chinese warships would reappear in later naval texts for many centuries. A tower ship with a traction trebuchet on its top deck, from the Wujing Zongyao Another tower ship from the Wujing Zongyao A combat ship from the Wujing Zongyao A covered assault ship from the Wujing Zongyao A flying barque from the Wujing Zongyao A patrol boat from the Wujing Zongyao A sea hawk ship from the Wujing Zongyao The Wujing Zongyao records detailed descriptions of gunpowder weapons such as incendiary projectiles, smoke bombs, fire arrows, and grenades. It documents incendiary projectiles containing low nitrate gunpowder, which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers. Examples of these incendiaries include the swallow tail incendiary yanweiju and the flying incendiary feiju . The swallow tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a swape lever installed within the walls of the city. The book also describes an 'igniter ball' used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The Wujing Zongyao stated the following The 'igniter ball' yin huo qiu is made of paper round like a ball, inside which is put between three and five pounds of powdered bricks. Melt yellow wax and let it stand until clear, then add powdered charcoal and make it into a paste permeating the ball bind it up with hempen string. When you want to find the range of anything, shoot off this fire ball first, then other incendiary balls can follow. Gunpowder was attached to fire arrows and utilized as an incendiary. The Wujing Zongyao records that fire arrows were launched from bows or crossbows. The gunpowder used for fire arrows was likely a low nitrate powder, and the quantity of gunpowder varied according to the type of bow. In the book, the force of gunpowder is said to be enough to launch an arrow, but only when the elasticity of the crossbow is sufficient. The Wujing Zongyao discusses various types of incendiary bombs and grenades. They used a low nitrate gunpowder that, while not powerful enough to cause an explosion, was effective for incendiary weapons. The huoqiu literally fire ball was filled with gunpowder and launched using a trebuchet. Upon impact, the huoqiu would start a fire among an invading army. Chinese bombs such as the thunder clap bomb or pili pao used a greater percentage of gunpowder than that of the huoqiu. The gunpowder mixture for a bomb was placed within a rigid container that held in the expanding gas, allowing for more powerful explosions. The thunder clap bomb was constructed with a container made from bamboo. In the Wujing Zongyao and other military texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which is analogous to the hand grenade. Gunpowder had already been invented prior to the Wujing Zongyao by Chinese alchemists in the 9th century. Early references to gunpowder can be found in the Daoist book Zhenyuan miaodao yaolue, written circa 850, and gunpowder was utilized in Chinese warfare as early as the 10th century in fire arrows and gunpowder fuses used to light the Chinese two piston flamethrower. However it was not until the Wujing Zongyao that the exact chemical formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison smoke bomb used for chemical warfare. The Wujing Zongyao's first recorded gunpowder formula used in these bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4 to 55.5 , sulfur content of 19.4 to 26.5 , and carbonaceous content of 23 to 25.2 . The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp. For the second formula, the inner ball alone had a nitrate percentage of 61.5 to 50.2 , a sulfur content of 30.8 to 25.1 , and if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 24.7 , if just taking the charcoal content alone, the carbon level was 7.7 . If the outer coating and inner ball are both included with the second black powder formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 34.7 to 54.8 , a sulfur content of 17.4 to 27.4 , and if all carbonaceous material is used, 47.9 carbon, if only charcoal is used, 17.8 . If the inner ball of the third black powder formula is only considered, it held nitrate levels of 39.6 if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 49.4 nitrate if excluding the poisons, and 60 if charcoal is specified alone. The sulfur content was 19.8 if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 24.7 if this excluded poisons, and 30 if charcoal is specified alone. The carbon content was 40.5 if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 25.9 if this excluded poisons, and 10 if charcoal alone was specified. If both the inner ball and outer coating are considered for the third formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 27 if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 31.2 if this excluded poisons, and 51.7 if charcoal alone was used. The sulfur content would be 13.5 if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 15.6 if this excluded the poisons, and 25.9 if only charcoal alone was specified. The carbon content was 59.5 if all carbonaceous matter was taken into account, 53.2 if this excluded poisons, and 22.4 if charcoal alone was specified. The first black powder concoction was simply labeled as the method for making the fire chemical , with its ingredients and measured weight in ounces of each ingredient listed in the section below with the others listed in similar fashion. 1st formula Total weight 82.2 oz. 2nd formula Inner ball Total weight of inner ball 79.7 oz. Outer coating Total weight of outer coating 36.6 oz. Total weight 116.3 oz. 3rd formula Inner ball Total weight of inner ball 77.7 oz. Outer coating Total weight of outer coating 36.6 oz. Total weight 114.3 oz. The Wujing Zongyao describes a flamethrower with a double acting two piston cylinder pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame. The first Chinese battle to use the double piston pump flamethrower was the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919 AD. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang Wolf Mountain River, , the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' huo you, to burn his fleet this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. Greek fire is likely based on distilled petroleum and is a weapon of Byzantine origin. The Chinese author Lin Yu explained in his book of 919 AD that Greek fire was acquired from their Arab maritime trade contacts in the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, the Chinese had been using the piston syringe since the Han Dynasty 202 BC 220 AD . However, it was the later Wujing Zongyao that would provide the first illustrated drawing and greater textual explanation for how this flamethrower operated. In describing the drawn illustration of the flamethrower in the book, the Wujing Zongyao states On the right is the petrol flamethrower lit. fierce fire oil shooter . The tank is made of brass, and supported on four legs. From its upper surface arise four vertical tubes attached to a horizontal cylinder above they are all connected with the tank. The head and the tail of the cylinder are large the middle is of narrow diameter . In the tail end there is a small opening as big as a millet grain. The head end has two round openings 112 inches in diameter. At the side of the tank there is a hole with a little tube which is used for filling, and this is fitted with a cover. Inside the cylinder there is a piston rod packed with silk floss, the head of which is wound round with hemp waste about 12 inches thick. Before and behind, the two communicating tubes are alternately occluded lit. controlled , and the mechanism thus determined. The tail has a horizontal handle the pump handle , in front of which there is a round cover. When the handle is pushed in the pistons close the mouth of the tubes in turn . Before use the tank is filled with rather more than three catties of the oil with a spoon through a filter at the same time gunpowder composition is placed in the ignition chamber at the head. When the fire is to be started one applies a heated branding iron to the ignition chamber , and the piston rod is forced fully into the cylinderthen the man at the back is ordered to draw the piston rod fully backwards and work it back and forth as vigorously as possible. Whereupon the oil the petrol comes out through the ignition chamber and is shot forth as blazing flame. Then the text goes on to provide further instructions about equipment, maintenance, and repair of flamethrowers When filling, use the bowl, the spoon and filter for igniting there is the branding iron for maintaining or renewing the fire there is the container. The branding iron is made sharp like an awl so that it may be used to unblock the tubes if they get stopped up. There are tongs with which to pick up the glowing fire, and there is a soldering iron for stopping up leaks. If the tanks or the tubes get cracked and leak they may be mended by using green wax. Altogether there are 12 items of equipment, all of brass except the tongs, the branding iron, and the soldering iron. Another method is to fix a brass gourd shaped container inside a large tube below it has two feet, and inside there are two small feet communicating with them comm all made of brass and there is also the piston. The method of shooting is as described above. If the enemy comes to attack a city, these weapons are placed on the great ramparts, or else in outworks, so that large numbers of assailants cannot get through.

"Severe Tropical Storm Wukong was a slow moving tropical cyclone which produced torrential rains over Japan. The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August 13, both the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August 15 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyushu. The cyclone remained over land for about 24 hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August 21. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516 mm 20.3 in . Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured. On August 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA began monitoring a tropical depression located to the south of Chichi jima island. The depression formed within a monsoonal gyre which also spawned Tropical Storm Sonamu. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W several hours after the JMA while the system was located about 140 km 85 mi south of Iwo Jima. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved towards the northwest. Early on August 13, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Wukong a name which was contributed by China. The names means the king of the monkeys and was featured in the novel Journey to the West. The storm slowed significantly as a ridge built eastward over Japan. On August 14, Wukong turned towards the northeast and reached its peak intensity with winds of 95 km h 60 mph 10 minute winds as a severe tropical storm. At the same time, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 95 km h 60 mph 1 minute winds . The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu later in the day before turning towards the west. On August 16, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan. Wukong made landfall late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyushu. As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100 km h 65 mph 1 minute winds . The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the Sea of Japan about 24 hours after landfall. Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan, the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for two more days before dissipating near the Russian coastline. According to Japanese weather officials, heavy rain, flood, storm and high wave warnings were put into effect for all of Kyushu and adjacent areas in Honshu. The two largest air carriers in Japan, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm. Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries. Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines, one of which crossed the entire prefecture. Long distance ferries were also shut down. Iwakuni, Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo, Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch. Wukong produced torrential rains over Japan, peaking at 516 mm 20.3 in in Hinokage, Miyazaki Prefecture. Flooding in Kyushu and the Yamaguchi Prefecture caused the evacuation of about 300 households. At least 200 residences were left without power in Kyushu. Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong, and three others were injured in storm related accidents. A total of seven landslides occurred, one of which damaged several homes. As the storm brushed the Korean Peninsula, it produced heavy rains, but caused no known damage.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Wukong%20%282006%29
"Wulfhelm died 12 February 941 was Bishop of Wells before being promoted to the Archbishopric of Canterbury about 926. Nothing is known about his time at Wells, but as archbishop he helped codify royal law codes and gave lands to monasteries. He went to Rome soon after his selection as archbishop. Two religious books that he gave to his cathedral are still extant. Wulfhelm was elected and consecrated Bishop of Wells between 923 and September 925. Nothing else is known about his time at Wells. Wulfhelm was translated from the Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury in about 926. While he was archbishop, he was a frequent attendee of the royal court, and King thelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting of the laws. Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by thelstan. One of the surviving manuscripts of thelstan's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present. From other parts of the laws issued by the king, it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield, at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king's peace. The implication of the various accounts of the laws of thelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal efforts to improve the law code. Wulfhelm also went to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his predecessors is unknown. One suggestion has been that because he had been translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it is unlikely that the impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope. Wulfhelm died while archbishop on 12 February 941. During his time as archbishop, he received as gifts two gospels that are still extant, as Wulfhelm donated them to Christ Church. One of the gospels was produced in Ireland, the other either in Lotharingia or Germany. The second gospel may originally have been a gift to thelstan during the negotiations over the marriage of thelstan's sister Edith to the future Emperor Otto I. These diplomatic events probably explain the appearance of Wulfhelm's name in the confraternity books of some German monasteries. He may also have given land to the church, although the record is a bit unclear as to exactly what was given. Another grant of land was of land at Deverel, Wiltshire to Glastonbury Abbey while he was archbishop. Wulfhelm was buried at Canterbury. He was buried at first the church of St John the Baptist near the Saxon era Canterbury Cathedral. When a new cathedral was constructed under Archbishop Lanfranc after the Norman Conquest of England, the earlier archbishops of Canterbury were moved to the north transept of the new cathedral. Later, Wulfhelm and his predecessor as bishop and archbishop Athelm were moved to a chapel dedicated to St Benedict, which later was incorporated into the Lady Chapel constructed by Prior Thomas Goldstone d. 1468 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfhelm
"Wulfred died 24 March 832 was an Anglo Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England. Nothing is known of his life prior to 803, when he attended a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings Coenwulf and Ceolwulf over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office for a number of years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were somewhat better with the new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck. The main sources for Wulfred's life are the surviving charters which mention him, a number of documents from his suffragan bishops pledging obedience, the records of a church council he presided over, and the coinage he issued. Wulfred is believed to have come from Middlesex and to have been a member of a wealthy and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions. Although earlier historians felt that Wulfred came from the Kentish nobility, it no longer appears that this was so. A kinsman, Werhard, owned property near Hayes, and Wulfred later owned property there also. Other evidence suggests that he was related to a noble family that owned lands in Harrow and Twickenham as well as Hayes. Wulfred was archdeacon of the community at Christ Church, Canterbury before the death of his predecessor thelhard on 12 May 805. Wulfred attended a synod as a member of thelhard's staff in 803, but this is the first mention of Wulfred in the historical record. On 26 July 805, he attended a synod and was named archbishop elect on the documents relating to the council decisions. Wulfred was consecrated archbishop on 3 August 805, or perhaps in October or later in 805. He may have owed his elevation to Canterbury to the fact that the kingdom of Mercia dominated Kent and Canterbury at this time. One of Wulfred's main objects as archbishop was the reformation of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury that of Christ Church. A main tenet was the establishment of communal life for the clergy in the cathedral chapter. This effort was modelled on that of Bishop Chrodegang of Metz. By 813, Wulfred was already claiming in a document that he had revived the holy monastery of the church of Canterbury by renewing, restoring and rebuilding it . Wulfred may have based the rule of the community on Chrodegang's Regula canonicorum, or perhaps on the rule of Benedict. His efforts including requiring the clergy to eat together, to give over their personal property to the chapter, and ensuring that the canonical hours were kept as part of the liturgy. Although it is clear that a communal style of living was practised, whether the cathedral clergy were transformed into canons or if they remained monks is unclear. Later, Wulfred granted land to the chapter, but the gifts would only be valid as long as the chapter kept to the new standards. Wulfred also used his personal wealth to fund the construction of new buildings. Wulfred came into conflict with King Coenwulf of Mercia over the issue of whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 they seem to have been on good terms the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815. In 814, Wulfred travelled to Rome to visit Pope Leo III. Although the exact nature of his business with the pope is unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries. He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster in Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the then victorious Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active in the last years of Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings. Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an unfavourable settlement by which Wulfred gained control over the debated monasteries in exchange for a large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 or possibly the following year , however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death. Wulfred died in 832, probably on 24 March. Most of his wealth was left to a kinsman, Werhard, who was to give the lands to Christ Church after his own death. Werhard, who was a member of the monastery of Christ Church, rose to the position of priest abbot by the middle years of the 830s. This is known from Wulfred's will, which survives in a late copy. This document names Werhard as Wulfred's nephew, and calls him priest. The Christ Church scriptorium was particularly active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting of the documents produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite elegant, the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad grammar and other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, although it is not known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfred
"Wulfstan sometimes Lupus died 28 May 1023 was an English Bishop of London, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York. He should not be confused with Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York, or Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester. He is thought to have begun his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk. He became the Bishop of London in 996. In 1002 he was elected simultaneously to the diocese of Worcester and the archdiocese of York, holding both in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester he remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was at London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, on the topic of Antichrist. In 1014, as archbishop, he wrote his most famous work, a homily which he titled the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, or the Sermon of the Wolf to the English. Besides sermons Wulfstan was also instrumental in drafting law codes for both kings thelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England. He is considered one of the two major writers of the late Anglo Saxon period in England. After his death in 1023, miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb, but attempts to have him declared a saint never bore fruit. Wulfstan's early life is obscure, but he was certainly the uncle of one Beorhtheah, his successor at Worcester but one, and the uncle of Wulfstan of Worcester. About Wulfstan's youth we know nothing. He probably had familial ties to the Fenlands in East Anglia, and to Peterborough specifically. Although there is no direct evidence of his ever being monastic, the nature of Wulfstan's later episcopal career and his affinity with the Benedictine Reform argue that he had once studied and professed as a Benedictine monk, perhaps at Winchester. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle, Wulfstan was consecrated bishop of London in 996, succeeding Aelfstan. Besides the notice in the Chronicle, the first record of his name is in a collection of nine Latin penitential letters collected by him, three of which were issued by him as bishop of London, and one by him as Archbishop of the English . The other five letters in the collection only one of which is addressed to Wulfstan, as archbishop were issued by Pope Gregory V and by a Pope John either Pope John XVII or Pope John XVIII . In the letters issued by Wulfstan as bishop of London he styles himself Lupus episcopus , meaning the bishop Wolf . Lupus is the Latin form of the first element of his Old English name, which means wolf stone . In 1002 Wulfstan was elected Archbishop of York and was immediately translated to that see. Holding York also brought him control over the diocese of Worcester, as at that time it was practice in England to hold the potentially disaffected northern archbishopric in plurality with a southern see. He held both Worcester and York until 1016, resigning Worcester to Leofsige while retaining York. There is evidence, however, that he retained influence over Worcester even after this time, and that Leofsige perhaps acted only as a suffragan to Wulfstan. Although holding two or more episcopal sees in plurality was both uncanonical and against the spirit of the Benedictine Reform, Wulfstan had inherited this practice from previous archbishops of York, and he was not the last to hold York and Worcester in plurality. Wulfstan must have early on garnered the favour of powerful men, particularly thelred king of England, for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under thelred's reign from 1005 to 1016. There is no doubt that Wulfstan had a penchant for law his knowledge of previous Anglo Saxon law both royal and ecclesiastical , as well as ninth century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king's legal draftsman. But it is also likely that Wulfstan's position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England's West Saxon throne in 1016. Wulfstan was one of the most distinguished and effective Old English prose writers. His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres, including homilies or sermons , secular laws, religious canons, and political theory. With lfric of Eynsham, he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh century England, a period which, ecclesiastically, was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform. The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy, a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Reform promoted a regular i.e. based on a regula, or rule life for priests and clerics, a strict church hierarchy, the primacy of the Roman see, the authority of codified or canonical church law, and stressed the importance of catholic, that is universal, church practices throughout all Christendom. These ideas could only thrive in a social and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy's and the laity's obedience to the authority of the church on all things spiritual, and also on many things secular and juridical. This was one of the main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan's legal and quasi legal writings. But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that, in order for this Reform model to thrive in England, the English clergy and laity especially the laity needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith. Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen's steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices, like, for example, knowledge of Christ's life and passion, memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles' Creed, proper baptism, and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass. It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices, that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity. In a series of homilies begun during his tenure as Bishop of London, Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan's homilies their tempo driven, almost feverish, quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes. An example from one of his earliest sermons, titled Secundum Lucam, describes with vivid rhetorical force the unpleasantries of Hell notice the alliteration, parallelism, and rhyme Wa am onne e r geearnode helle wite. r is ece bryne grimme gemencged, r is ece gryre r is granung wanung aa singal heof r is ealra yrma gehwylc ealra deofla gering. Wa am e r sceal wunian on wite. Betere him wre t he man nre fre geworden onne he gewurde. This type of heavy handed, though effective, rhetoric immediately made Wulfstan's homilies popular tools for use at the pulpit. There is good evidence that Wulfstan's homiletic style was appreciated by his contemporaries. While yet bishop of London, in 1002 he received an anonymous letter in Latin praising his style and eloquence. In this letter, an unknown contemporary refuses to do a bit of translation for Wulfstan because he fears he could never properly imitate the Bishop's style. The Chronicle of Ely said of his preaching that when he spoke, it was as if his listeners were hearing the very wisdom of God Himself. Though they were rhetorically ornate, Wulfstan's homilies show a conscious effort to avoid the intellectual conceits presumably favoured by educated i.e. monastic audiences his target audience was the common English Christian, and his message was suited to everyone who wished to flock to the cathedral to hear it. Wulfstan refused to include in his works confusing or philosophical concepts, speculation, or long narratives devices which other homilies of the time regularly employed likely to the dismay of the average parishioner . He also rarely used Latin phrases or words, though a few of his homilies do survive in Latin form, versions that were either drafts for later English homilies, or else meant to be addressed to a learned clergy. Even so, even his Latin sermons employ a straightforward approach to sermonising. Wulfstan's homilies are concerned only with the bare bones, but these he invests with a sense of urgency of moral or legal rigorism in a time of great danger . The canon of Wulfstan's homiletic works is somewhat ambiguous, as it is often difficult to tell if a homily in his style was actually written by Wulfstan, or is merely the work of someone who had appreciated Wulfstanian style and imitated it. However, throughout his episcopal career, he is believed to have written upwards of 30 sermons in Old English. The number of his Latin sermons has not yet been established. He may also have been responsible, wholly or in part, for other extant anonymous Old English sermons, for his style can be detected in a range of homiletic texts which cannot be directly attributed to him. However, as mentioned, some scholars believe that Wulfstan's powerful rhetorical style produced imitators, whose homilies would now be difficult to distinguish from genuine Wulfstanian homilies. Those homilies which are certainly by Wulfstan can be divided into 'blocks', that is by subject and theme, and in this way it can be seen that at different points in his life Wulfstan was concerned with different aspects of Christian life in England. The first 'block' was written ca. 9961002 and is concerned with eschatology, that is, the end of the world. These homilies give frequent descriptions of the coming of Antichrist and the evils that will befall the world before Christ's Second Coming. They likely play on the anxiety that surely developed as the end of the first millennium AD approached. The second 'block', written around 10021008, is concerned with the tenets of the Christian faith. The third 'block', written around 10081020, concerns archiepiscopal functions. The fourth and final 'block', written around 10141023, known as the Evil Days 'block', concerns the evils that befall a kingdom and people who do not live proper Christian lives. This final block contains his most famous homily, the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, where Wulfstan rails against the deplorable customs of his time, and sees recent Viking invasions as God's punishment of the English for their lax ways. About 1008 and again in a revision about 1016 he wrote a lengthy work which, although not strictly homiletic, summarises many of the favourite points he had hitherto expounded upon in his homilies. Titled by modern editors as the Institutes of Polity, it is a piece of 'estates literature' which details, from the perspective of a Christian polity, the duties of each member of society, beginning with the top the king and ending at the bottom common folk . Wulfstan was a native speaker of Old English. He was also a competent Latinist. As York was at the centre of a region of England that had for some time been colonised by people of Scandinavian descent, it is possible that Wulfstan was familiar with, or perhaps even bilingual in, Old Norse. He may have helped incorporate Scandinavian vocabulary into Old English. Dorothy Whitelock remarks that the influence of his sojourns in the north is seen in his terminology. While in general he writes a variety of late West Saxon literary language, he uses in some texts words of Scandinavian origin, especially in speaking of the various social classes. In some cases, Wulfstan is the only one known to have used a word in Old English, and in some cases such words are of Scandinavian origin. Some words of his that have been recognised as particularly Scandinavian are rl slave, servant cf. Old Norse rll cp. Old English eowa , bonda husband, householder cf. Old Norse bondi cp. Old English ceorl , eorl nobleman of high rank, Danish jarl cf. Old Norse jarl cp. Old English ealdorman , fysan to make someone ready, to put someone to flight cf. Old Norse fysa , genydmaga close kinsfolk cf. Old Norse nauleyti , and laga law cf. Old Norse lag cp. Old English w Some Old English words which appear only in works under his influence are werewulf were wolf, sibleger incest, leohtgescot light scot a tithe to churches for candles , tofesian, gylde, and morwyrhta Wulfstan was very involved in the reform of the English church, and was concerned with improving both the quality of Christian faith and the quality of ecclesiastical administration in his dioceses especially York, a relatively impoverished diocese at this time . Towards the end of his episcopate in York, he established a small monastery in Gloucester, which had to be re established in 1058 after being burned. In addition to his religious and literary career, Wulfstan enjoyed a lengthy and fruitful career as one of England's foremost statesmen. Under both thelred II and Cnut, Wulfstan was primarily responsible for the drafting of English law codes relating to both secular and ecclesiastical affairs, and seems to have held a prominent and influential position at court. He drew up the laws that thelred issued at Enham in 1008, which dealt with the cult of St Edward the Martyr, the raising and equipping of ships and ship's crews, the payment of tithes, and a ban on the export of Christian slaves from the kingdom. Pushing for religious, social, political, and moral reforms, Wulfstan wrote legislation to reassert the laws of earlier Anglo Saxon kings and bring order to a country that had been unsettled by war and influx of Scandinavians. In 1009 Wulfstan wrote the edict that thelred II issued calling for the whole nation to fast and pray for three days during Thorkell's raids on England, in a national act of penance. Only water and bread were to be eaten, people should walk to church barefoot, a payment of one penny from each hide of land was to be made, and everyone should attend Mass every day of the three days. Anyone not participating would be fined or flogged. After Cnut conquered England, Wulfstan quickly became an advisor to the new king, as evidenced by Wulfstan's influence on the law code issued by Cnut. After the death of Lyfing, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1020, Wulfstan consecrated his successor thelnoth in 1020, and wrote to Cnut asking the king to grant the same rights and dignities for the new archbishop that previous archbishops had held. Wulfstan also wrote the laws that were issued by Cnut at Winchester in 1021 or 1022. These laws continued in force throughout the 11th century, as they were the laws referred to in Domesday Book as the law of King Edward . Wulfstan died at York on 28 May 1023. His body was taken for burial to the monastery of Ely, in accordance with his wishes. Miracles are ascribed to his tomb by the Liber Eliensis, but it does not appear that any attempt to declare him a saint was made beyond this. The historian Denis Bethell called him the most important figure in the English Church in the reigns of thelred II and Cnut. Wulfstan's writings influenced a number of writers in late Old English literature. There are echoes of Wulfstan's writings in the 1087 entry of the Peterborough Chronicle, a version of the Anglo Saxon Chronicle written at Peterborough Abbey. This entry has long been famous as it deals with the death of King William the Conqueror, and contrasts his worldly power with his status after death. Other suggestions of Wulfstan's writing occur in works of Old English, including the Soul's Address to the Body. His law codes, which were written under thelred and Cnut, remained in effect through the reign of King Edward the Confessor, and were still being reaffirmed in 1100, when King Henry I of England swore a coronation oath to observe the laws of King Edward. The unique 11th century manuscript of the Early English Apollonius of Tyre may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Wulfstan's homilies. Wulfstan wrote some works in Latin, and numerous works in Old English, then the vernacular. He has also been credited with a few short poems. His works can generally be divided into homiletic, legal, and philosophical categories. Wulfstan's best known homily is Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, or Sermon of the Wolf to the English. In it he proclaims the depredations of the Danes who were, at that point, primarily Norwegian invaders a scourge from God to lash the English for their sins. He calls upon them to repent of their sinful ways and return to the faith of baptism, where there is protection from the fires of hell. He also wrote many homilies relating to the Last Days and the coming of the Antichrist. Age of the Antichrist was a popular theme in Wulfstan's homilies, which also include the issues of death and Judgment Day. Six homilies that illustrate this theme include Secundum Matheum, Secundum Lucam, De Anticristo, De Temporibus Antichrist, Secundum Marcum and De Falsis Deis . De Antichristo was the first full development of the Antichrist theme , and Wulfstan addressed it to the clergy. Believing that he lived at the time right before the Antichrist was to come, he felt compelled to diligently warn and teach the clergy to withstand the dishonest teaching of the enemies of God. These six homilies also include emphasis that the hour of the Antichrist is very near, warnings that the English should be aware of false Christs who will attempt to seduce men, warnings that God will pass judgement on man's faithfulness, discussion of man's sins, evils of the world, and encouragement to love God and do his will. He wrote the Canons of Edgar and The Law of Edward and Guthrum which date before 1008. The Canons was written to instruct the secular clergy serving a parish in the responsibilities of their position. The Law of Edward and Guthrum, on the other hand, is an ecclesiastical law handbook. Modern editors have paid most attention to his homilies they have been edited by Arthur Napier, by Dorothy Whitelock, and by Dorothy Bethurum. Since that publication, other works that were likely authored by Wulfstan have been identified a forthcoming edition by Andy Orchard will update the canon of Wulfstan's homilies. Wulfstan was also a book collector he is responsible for amassing a large collection of texts pertaining to canon law, the liturgy, and episcopal functions. This collection is known as Wulftan's Commonplace Book. A significant part of the Commonplace book consists of a work once known as the Excerptiones pseudo Ecgberhti, though it has most recently been edited as Wulfstan's Canon Law Collection a.k.a. Collectio canonum Wigorniensis . This work is a collection of conciliar decrees and church canons, most of which he culled from numerous ninth and tenth century Carolingian works. This work demonstrates the wide range of Wulfstan's reading and studies. He sometimes borrowed from this collection when he wrote his later works, especially the law codes of thelred. There are also a number of works which are associated with the archbishop, but whose authorship is unknown, such as the Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor. Wulfstans style is highly admired by many sources, easily recognisable and exceptionally distinguished. Much Wulfstan material is, more over, attributed largely or even solely on the basis of his highly idiosyncratic prose style, in which strings of syntactically independent two stress phrases are linked by complex patterns of alliteration and other kinds of sound play. Indeed, so idiosyncratic is Wulfstans style that he is even ready to rewrite minutely works prepared for him by lfric Blackwell, 495 . From this identifiable style, 26 sermons can be attributed to Wulfstan, 22 of which are written in Old English, the others in Latin. However, its suspected that many anonymous materials are Wulfstans as well, and his handwriting has been found in many manuscripts, supplementing or correcting material 495 . He wrote more than just sermons, including law codes and sections of prose. Certainly he must have been a very talented writer, gaining a reputation of eloquence while he still lived in London Bethurum, 58 . In a letter to him, the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishops skill 58 . Similarly, ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose Continuations, 229 . This suggests Wulfstan's writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm 229 . Taking a look at Wulfstan's actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured even his notes in the margins are well organised and tidy, and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable. original research",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfstan%20%28died%201023%29
"Johann Jakob von Wunsch 17171788 was soldier of fortune and Prussian general of infantry, and a particularly adept commander of light infantry. The son of a Wurttemberg furrier, he served in several armies in the course of his lengthy career. Shortly after he turned 18, his father enrolled him in Wurttemberg service. In the Wurttemberg Regiment, he supported the Austrians against the Ottoman Empire in 1737. Later, he served in Bavarian army during the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1748 he came to the notice of Prince Henry, and enter Prussian service for the Seven Years' War, where he led an autonomous corps in many raids and skirmishes that wrought havoc on the Austrian forces. His incursion over Prussia's border with Bohemia in 1778 was the opening action of the War of the Bavarian Succession. In peace time, he devoted his efforts to training light infantry, developing an autonomous corps of skirmishers. Frederick the Great's successor, Frederick Wilhem II, promoted him to general of infantry and raised him to the Prussian nobility. Wunsch was born on 22 December 1717 in Heidenheim, Wurttemberg to a furrier and died at Prenzlau, in the Kingdom of Prussia on 18 October 1788. His grandfather served in the Austrian military, and his father had served for a few years in the Bavarian military. He received schooling locally, and on his eighteenth year, his father sent him to Officer Cadet training in the Duke of Wurttemberg's Regiment. While with this regiment in Vienna, he married Josephine le Roi, the daughter of a Habsburg War Commissary. They had one son. The Duke of Wurttemberg's regiment supported the Austrian military in its wars with the Ottoman Empire. Between 1737 and 1739, Wunsch participated in several battles in the vicinity of Banja Luka, in modern day Bosnia and Herzegovina. By 1739, he realized he had prospects in neither Austrian nor Wurttemberg service and he entered Bavarian service as the oldest second lieutenant in the Hussar Regiment Frangipani. Upon the death of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor, the new Duke of Bavaria, Maximilian III Joseph, agreed to forgo any imperial aspirations. Wunsch's Bavarian regiment went into the service in the Netherlands, where it eventually liberated Brussels from the French in 1745. In the course of this service, Wunsch advanced to the rank of Rittmeister, or captain of cavalry. At the conclusion of the war in 1749, Rittmeister Wunsch acquired a staff position and a pension and remained in the Netherlands with his wife and son. When it became apparent that there would be another war, in 1756 he offered his services to Frederick the Great and became the oldest captain in Prussian service. His unit came under the command of Prince Henry of Prussia, an officer who understood the value of the new military formation of light troops for skirmishing and raids. Throughout the Seven Years' War, Wunsch operated successfully as a light troops officer. After the Battle of Prague in 1757, he was promoted to major. He followed this up with stellar action near Torgau in September, and the following day his troops overran Leipzig. The subsequent Prussian successes at the battles of Breslau and Leuthen led to his promotion, this time by Frederick himself, to lieutenant colonel. The King also gave him command of an independent battalion and awarded him the Order Pour le Merite. Wunsch made a brief journey to his home town of Heidenheim and returned to his unit in Bohemia. Wunsch's raids were so successful that, in 1758, Frederick promoted him to the rank of colonel and gave him his own regiment of light troops to command. Two days later, at the Battle of Kunersdorf, the Prussian army was nearly destroyed. Wunsch's only child, a son, was killed in the battle. Frederick barely escaped with his life, assisted by his remaining cavalry. Wunsch's small force remained intact and provided the rear guard for Frederick's escape. In Berlin, Wunsch commanded the city's defenses. From April to November 1759, he led his regiment on a series of raids and skirmishes in Silesia, Bohemia, Franconia, and Thuringia, such as the Battle of Peterswalde Silesia in August 1759. Wunsch took the pass of Reizenhain from the Austrians, skirmished with them at Konigswarte and attacked and beat a small force of Austrians at Weinberg. He acquired two cannons in the engagement. He successfully raided various towns and cities held by Austria and her allies in Franconia, Saxony, and Bohemia, capturing supplies and cannons and frequently taking many prisoners. His son was a lieutenant in his regiment during these raids. Following this action, Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a corps of 10,00012,000 men in his first independent command. There he participated in the Battle of Hoyerswerda with General Frederick August Finck. Prince Henry, in overall command of the army, surprised von Daun at Hoyerswerda by punching a hole in the Austrian defensive line. This success gave Frederick the first good news he had had in weeks and confirmed to Frederick that Wunsch had been worthy of the trust placed in him. After two months of skirmishing in Bohemia, in November Wunsch participated in the Battle of Maxen. There, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun's army isolated and captured Finck. Subsequently, Wunsch led both his corps and Finck's until they too were surrounded Daun's army was three times the size of Finck's and Wunsch's combined force. Wunsch capitulated on 21 November 1759 and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner in Innsbruck. After the war, Frederick reorganized his army, placing nine of his generals under command of General Hans Joachim von Zieten. An additional eight were placed under command of Finck. Wunsch remained the only general with an independent corps, further unusual in that he was not Prussian. Wunsch used the ensuing years of peace in garrison at Prenzlau to reorganize the light corps of Frederick's army. In 1778, he patrolled the border of Austrian Bohemia during the tense negotiations surrounding Bavarian Succession crisis. His entry into Bohemia in early July of that year was the first action of the War of the Bavarian Succession. There were no major engagements in the war, only a series of raids in which both sides tried to deny each other access to food and fodder. After his initial foray at the Silesia border, he and his command remained at the County of Glatz, guarding the military commissary and the bakery. In 1787, Frederick Wilhelm II, Frederick the Great's successor, named Wunsch a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle for his excellent service. After a lengthy illness, Wunsch died of a pneumonia in Prenzlau on 18 October 1788. Prince Henry established a monument for him in 1790, in Rheinsberg. Its inscription reads Johann Jakob von Wunsch, the son of Heidenheim, the splendid monument which the Prussian people have established on behalf of their King, Frederick The Great.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann%20Jakob%20von%20Wunsch
"World War II Josef Sepp Wurmheller 4 May 1917 22 June 1944 was a German Luftwaffe pilot during World War II, a fighter ace credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down in over 300 combat missions. He claimed the majority of his aerial victories over the Western Front, and nine over the Eastern Front. Of his 93 victories over the Western Allies, at least 1820 were four engined bombers and 56 were against Supermarine Spitfire fighters. Born in Hausham, Wurmheller was a glider pilot in his youth, and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany in 1937. Following flight training he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 53 JG 5353rd Fighter Wing in 1939. He claimed his first aerial victory on the Western Front on 30 September 1939, a phase of World War II dubbed the Phoney War. He then served as a flight instructor before returning to JG 53 for the Battle of Britain. In June 1941 he participated in Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 4 September 1941 after 32 victories. Following another tour as fighter pilot instructor, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 2 Richthofen JG 22nd Fighter Wing operating on the Channel Front. Wurmheller claimed seven aerial victories during the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942 and after his 67th victory was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 1 October 1942. In April 1943, Wurmheller was appointed Staffelkapitan squadron leader of 9. Staffel 9th squadron of JG 2 Richthofen . On 8 June 1944, two days after the Allied Invasion of Normandy, he was given command of III. Gruppe 3rd group of JG 2 Richthofen . He and his wingman were killed in a mid air collision during combat near Alencon, France on 22 June 1944. Wurmheller was posthumously promoted to Major major and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 24 October 1944. Wurmheller was born on 4 May 1917 in Hausham in the Kingdom of Bavaria, a federated state of the German Empire. After growing up on his uncle's farm at Schliersee, he spent four years working as a miner like his father. He was also an enthusiastic glider pilot and in 1937 he volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe. Following training as a fighter pilot, Wurmheller, holding the rank of Unteroffizier sergeant , was posted to 2. Staffel 2nd squadron of Jagdgeschwader 53 JG 5353rd Fighter Wing in 1939. World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. On 30 September, elements of I. Gruppe 1st group of JG 53 encountered a formation of five Royal Air Force RAF Fairey Battle single engined bombers in the vicinity of Saarbrucken during the early Phoney War period. Wurmheller claimed his first victory during this encounter. The Fairey Battle K9283, of No. 150 Squadron flown by Squadron Leader William MacDonald, was on an aerial reconnaissance mission in the area from Metzing to Saarbrucken and crash landed at Ecury sur Coole. For this victory, Wurmheller received the Iron Cross 2nd Class Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse on 19 October 1939. He was posted to the Jagdfliegerschule fighter pilot school at Werneuchen as an instructor in November 1939. Following a tour as an instructor at the Luftwaffe fighter pilot school, Wurmheller returned to 5. Staffel of JG 53 in June 1940. During the Battle of Britain, he flew combat missions as a fighter pilot and as a fighter bomber pilot. He claimed four further victories in this campaign and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse on 16 October 1940. He was shot down three times himself by RAF fighters and each time had to bail out. On the third occasion, he was shot down in Messerschmitt Bf 109 E 4 Werknummer 5242factory number at approximately 5 10 pm on 23 November over the English Channel and had to swim for four and a half hours before he was rescued by a Schnellboot E boat of the Kriegsmarine Navy . Hospitalized until March 1941, he returned to combat duty and claimed two Supermarine Spitfires shot down on 7 May 1941, his 9th and 10th victories. Wurmheller's unit was subsequently transferred to the Eastern Front in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941. During Barbarossa he was deployed in the southern sector of the German advance. He added nine victorieseight bombers and one Polikarpov I 16 Rata fighterin this theater of operations. His last victory on the Eastern Front, his 19th overall, was claimed on 15 July 1941. Wurmheller was transferred back to the Channel Front on 20 July 1941. He was assigned to the Stab headquarters unit of II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 2 Richthofen JG 22nd Fighter Wing , named after the World War I fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen. He claimed his 20th aerial victory on 24 July 1941 and over a period of four weeks claimed a further 12 victories, all over Spitfires, including five in one day, making him an ace in a day . On 30 August 1941, Wurmheller was awarded the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe , and on 4 September he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes for 32 aerial victories. His former unit, 5. Staffel of JG 53, had nominated him for the Knight's Cross, but the nomination was not approved until he was assigned to JG 2 Richthofen . On the same day, his fellow II. Gruppe pilot Oberfeldwebel Kurt Buhligen also received the Knight's Cross. At the time, Wurmheller flew a Bf 109 F 2 from the airbase at St Pol Bryas. Following a minor injury, Wurmheller was again posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon his return to front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to 1. Staffel and claimed 10 victories during May 1942 and a further 12 victories the following month. Among these claims were four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942. Most of these missions were flown with Rudolf Pflanz as his wingman. Wurmheller's most successful day as a fighter pilot was during the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. On that day, the Allies unsuccessfully attacked the German occupied port of Dieppe. Over 6,000 infantrymen, predominantly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian armored regiment and a strong force of Royal Marines and smaller RAF landing contingents. Wurmheller, whose right foot was plastered in an orthopedic cast, claimed seven victories during the course of four combat missions that day, six Spitfires and a Bristol Blenheim bomber. The Blenheim most likely was a misidentified Martin Baltimore. He had to abort his first mission due to engine trouble, suffering a minor concussion in the forced landing. He returned from his second mission claiming two Spitfires and a Blenheim shot down. His third mission resulted in the destruction of three more Spitfires, his 56th to 58th victories. Wurmheller claimed another Spitfire shot down on his fourth combat mission. The next day, 20 August, he claimed his 60th aerial victory, which earned him the German Cross in Gold Deutsches Kreuz in Gold it was awarded on 21 August. Wurmheller was promoted to Leutnant second lieutenant for bravery in the face of the enemy on 1 October 1942. Following his 67th aerial victory, achieved in about 150 combat missions, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub on 14 November 1942. He was the 146th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored. The United States Army Air Forces USAAF , in particular the Eighth Air Force, began regular combat when the VIII Bomber Command attacked the RouenSotteville marshalling yards in France on 17 August 1942. Wurmheller claimed four Boeing B 17 Flying Fortress bombers shot down on 3 January 1943. On 1 April 1943 he was appointed Staffelkapitan squadron leader of 9. Staffel of JG 2 Richthofen , succeeding Hauptmann Captain Siegfried Schnell, who was transferred to III. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 JG 5454th Fighter Wing . Wurmheller claimed his 70th victory on 17 May, when he shot down a B 17. On 23 September, Wurmheller was wounded by bomb splinters while making an emergency landing in his Focke Wulf Fw 190 A 6 during a bombing raid at VannesMeucon. Sepp , as he was named by his comrades, was promoted to Oberleutnant first lieutenant on 1 August 1943 and to Hauptmann on 1 November 1943. He claimed his first heavy bomber in the Defense of the Reich campaign on 8 February 1944 in the vicinity of Le Treport. On 8 March 1944, he claimed his 90th victory overall. Wurmheller claimed further aerial victories following the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. He was appointed Gruppenkommandeur group commander of III. Gruppe of JG 2 Richthofen on 8 June, succeeding Hauptmann Herbert Huppertz who was killed in action near Caen earlier that day. Wurmheller claimed the last three victories of his total of 102 on 16 June 1944. He was the 80th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. Wurmheller was killed in his Fw 190 A 8 Werknummer 171 053 on 22 June 1944, when he collided with his wingman, Feldwebel Staff Sergeant Kurt Franzke, during aerial combat with USAAF Republic P 47 Thunderbolt and Royal Canadian Air Force RCAF Spitfire fighters near Alencon. He was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern and promoted to the rank of Major major on 24 October 1944, which was back dated to 1 June 1944. Wurmheller and Franzke were buried beside each other at the Champigny Saint Andre German war cemetery, near Saint Andre de l'Eure, in plot 9, graves 1704 and 1705 respectively. Matthews and Foreman, authors of Luftwaffe Aces Biographies and Victory Claims, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 103 aerial victory claims, plus five further unconfirmed claims. This figure of confirmed claims includes nine Soviet Air Forces piloted aircraft on the Eastern Front and 94 on the Western Front, including 21 four engined bomber. Victory claims were logged to a map reference PQ Planquadrat , for example PQ 3841 . The Luftwaffe grid map Jagermeldenetz covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude, an area of about 360 square miles 930 km2 . These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 4 km in size. This and the Ace of spades indicates those aerial victories which made Wurmheller an ace in a day , a term which designates a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more airplanes in a single day. This and the dash indicates unwitnessed aerial victory claims for which Wurmheller did not receive credit.

"Paul Bernard Wurtsmith 9 August 1906 13 September 1946 was a United States Army Air Forces general during World War II. Enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps as a flying cadet in 1927, Wurtsmith was commissioned in 1928. Over the next 13 years, he served in instructional and command positions. He took over command of the 49th Pursuit Group in December 1941 and between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters downed 78 enemy aircraft in the defense of Darwin in northern Australia, against Japanese air attacks. In 1943 he assumed command of the V Fighter Command, part of Major General George Kenney's Fifth Air Force. In 1945, he commanded the Thirteenth Air Force in the Southern Philippines and Borneo campaigns. After the war Wurtsmith served with the Strategic Air Command. Wurtsmith was killed when his North American B 25 Mitchell medium bomber crashed near the summit of Cold Mountain near Asheville, North Carolina, on September 13, 1946. In February 1953, the United States Air Force named Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda Township, Michigan, in his honor. Paul Bernard Wurtsmith was born in Detroit, Michigan, on 9 August 1906, the eldest of three sons of Fred Bernard Wurtsmith, a railroad engineer on the Pere Marquette Railroad, and his wife Ella. Paul was educated at Holy Redeemer Grammar School and Cass Technical High School in Detroit. In his teenage years he earned some money working as a copy boy at The Detroit News and in his spare time he worked on a Ford Model T hot rod. He attended the University of Detroit, where he earned a degree in aeronautical engineering. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps as a flying cadet on 4 August 1927. On earning his wings through the successful completion of flight training at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, he was directly commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Reserve on 23 June 1928. On 2 February 1929, he received a regular commission in the US Army Air Corps. He married Irene Gillespie. The couple had no children. Wurtsmith joined the 94th Pursuit Squadron, the famed World War I Hat in the Ring Squadron, at Selfridge Field, Michigan. Over the next 13 years, he served in numerous instructional and command positions. He won the Mitchell Trophy Air Race in 1930. On 1 October 1934, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was temporary captain from 7 August 1935 to 16 June 1936 before being promoted substantively on 2 February 1939. He graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School in 1939. Wurtsmith commanded the 17th Pursuit Squadron at Selfridge Field from September 1939 to July 1940, then the 41st Pursuit Squadron until January 1941. Still at Selfridge Field, he served with the 50th Pursuit Group until December 1941, when he assumed command of the 49th Pursuit Group at Key Field, Mississippi, shortly after the United States entered the war following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The 49th Pursuit Group was soon on its way to fight the Japanese in the South West Pacific. Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number of times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its principal defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily dependent on their Australian allies. Morale was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost. Between December 1941 and March 1942, over 300 P 40 Kittyhawks, 100 P 400 and 90 P 39 Airacobras had been sent to Australia of these, around 125 had been lost to enemy action in the Dutch East Indies campaign, 75 had been transferred to the RAAF, 74 were under or awaiting repair and perhaps another 100 had yet to be completely assembled. On 18 March, 33 P 39s, 92 P 40s and 52 P 400s were on hand. While there were three USAAF pursuit groups in Australia, the 8th, 35th and 49th, Wurtsmith's was the only one considered combat ready. Of the 102 pilots in his group, only Wurtsmith, with 4,800 hours of pursuit time, and his executive officer, Major Donald R. Hutchinson, with 2,600 hours, were veteran pilots. Five others had more than 600 hours and nine had about 15 hours. The remaining 89 pilots had no pursuit time at all. The P 40s were better armored and faster in level flight than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P 40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P 40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was practically suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit the strengths of the P 40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P 40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted to make sure that he had enough P 40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P 40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P 40s the P 40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P 40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft. In August 1942, Major General George Kenney assumed command of the Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, becoming the senior Allied air officer under the theater commander, General Douglas MacArthur. Kenney split the Allied Air Forces into Australian and American components, with the American part becoming the re formed Fifth Air Force in September 1942. Kenney concurrently commanded the Fifth Air Force, with Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead as his deputy. The major commands of the Fifth Air Force were the V Service Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln, V Bomber Command under Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, and the V Fighter Command. Activated at Fort George Wright in April 1942 as V Interceptor Command, it was redesignated V Fighter Command in August. Wurtsmith assumed command on 11 November, with his headquarters at Port Moresby. Kenney told him that if he made good , he would be promoted to brigadier general. If not, he would be sent home on a slow boat. By early 1943, Kenney was convinced that Wurtsmith had made good in the Papuan Campaign, and he took the papers recommending Wurtsmith's promotion to MacArthur, who promised to approve it and sent it in to Washington, DC. One of MacArthur's staff quipped that he hoped Wurtsmith was over 21. Wurtsmith was actually 36 but MacArthur, who had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general at age 37, icily replied, We promote them out here for efficiency, not age. Wurtsmith was duly promoted on 8 February 1943. He also became one of a handful of American officers to be decorated by the Australian government, being awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire for excellence of training and direction of fighter operations in New Guinea . The award was eventually presented by General Sir Thomas Blamey on Leyte in March 1945. The first long range American fighter was the twin engined P 38 Lightning but none reached the South West Pacific Area until October 1942 and, beset with a host of mechanical difficulties, it was not until December 1942 that they flew their first major combat mission over New Guinea. Deliveries were suspended in January 1943 owing to the requirements of the North African Campaign, forcing Kenney to accept the P 47 Thunderbolt, the first of which arrived in Australia in July 1943. Early model P 47s had less range than P 40 Kittyhawks until 200 imperial gallon 910 l fuel tanks could be manufactured for them in Australia. These enabled the 348th Fighter Group to become operational in August 1943. While the tanks were very successful on the P 38s and P 40s, overloading the P 47s caused numerous crashes, and the pilots were reluctant to fly with more than 505 US gallons 1,910 l of fuel. In 1945, the P 47s were replaced by P 51 Mustangs. By September 1943, Wurtsmith's five fighter groups had 598 aircraft but this included 70 P 39s, 30 P 400s and 118 P 40s, half of which were in the depots. The technical representative of Bell Aircraft reported that the P 39s and P 40s averaged 300 combat hours. That of Curtiss Wright similarly reported that the P 40s had from 300 to 500 combat hours, which was equivalent to about 2,000 normal hours. General Kenney wrote to General Henry H. Arnold that With the possible exception of Chennault, I do not believe that anyone else is flying stuff as old and worn out as these youngsters out here. In New Guinea, the main role of the fighters was escortsomething not foreseen before the war. Early losses of bombers made fighter protection the rule rather than the exception, and if fighter cover was not available, the bombers flew by night. During the last half of 1943, V Fighter Command flew 6,607 sorties in support of bombers and 10,215 to protect transports, out of 24,397 sorties for the period in total. These missions often depended upon securing forward fighter fields, particularly for long missions. Wurtsmith made what he claimed was the shortest landing ever made in a P 40 at Marilinan in order to see if it could serve as a forward fighter strip. He proved that it could, although a better site was subsequently located at nearby Tsili Tsili. This base allowed Wurtsmith's fighters to support the bombing of Wewak and the landing at Nadzab. The range of the fighters was increased by the addition of external 200 gallon fuel tanks. Then, in July 1944, Charles Lindbergh, who was visiting the South West Pacific area as civilian observer, taught Wurtsmith's pilots how to obtain additional range by economical operation of their engines. The new technique increased the combat radius of the P 38s to 600 miles 970 km , a gain of some 30 percent. Combining three external droppable tanks with new techniques increased the range of the P 40s to 650 miles 1,050 km . On 30 January 1945, Wurtsmith replaced Major General St. Clair Streett as commander of the Thirteenth Air Force. He was promoted to the rank of major general on 19 March 1945. The Thirteenth Air Force was tasked with the support of Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger's Eighth United States Army in the Victor series of operations to clear the Southern Philippines that included the Invasion of Palawan, Battle of the Visayas, and the Battle of Mindanao. Operating under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock's RAAF Command, the Thirteenth Air Force also supported Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead's Australian I Corps in the Oboe series of operations against Japanese forces in Borneo. Wurtsmith relinquished command of the Thirteenth Air Force in July 1946 and returned to the United States, where he was assigned to the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command SAC at Washington, DC's Bolling Field. While perhaps an unusual posting for a fighter expert, SAC was then commanded by Kenney. Wurtsmith attended the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests on Bikini Atoll as an observer, and in September 1946, he was appointed commander of the Eighth Air Force, one of SAC's three numbered air forces. On 12 September 1946, he took off from MacDill Field, Florida, in a B 25 Mitchell. He first flew to Bolling Field, where he had some business, then on to Selfridge Field. He paid a visit to his family, whom he had not seen for three years, including his mother Ella, whose 77th birthday was on 14 September. On 13 September, with Wurtsmith at the controls, the Mitchell, 44 30227, set out for MacDill Field in bad weather, flying at 6,000 feet 1,800 m below the safe altitude for the area. At around 11 20 all on board were killed when the aircraft crashed into Cold Mountain, about 20 miles 32 km southwest of Asheville, North Carolina. The official report listed the cause of the crash as miscalculation of altitude . Wurtsmith's remains were recovered from Cold Mountain and were interred in Arlington National Cemetery on 17 September 1946. In February 1953, the United States Air Force named Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan, in his honor. Special guests at the dedication ceremony included his mother Ella, his widow Irene, his nephews Paul D. Wurtsmith and Fred Wurtsmith, and George Kenney. General Thomas D. White told the crowd that the base was being named after a man who was probably the best fighter pilot and fighter tactician in all of World War II . In 1954, Ella Wurtsmith was named Michigan Mother of the Year. Among the letters recommending her for the honor was one from General MacArthur.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20Wurtsmith
"SMS Wurttemberg was one of four Sachsen class armored frigates of the German Imperial Navy. Her sister ships were Sachsen, Bayern, and Baden. Wurttemberg was built in the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin from 1876 to 1881. The ship was commissioned into the Imperial Navy in August 1881. She was armed with a main battery of six 26 cm 10 in guns in two open barbettes. After her commissioning, Wurttemberg served with the fleet on numerous training exercises and cruises. She participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s. During 18981899, the ship was modernized at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel she served for another seven years with the fleet before being withdrawn from active service in 1906. She was subsequently used in a variety of secondary roles, until she was sold in 1920 and broken up for scrap. The Sachsen class was the first group of capital ships built under the tenure of General Albrecht von Stosch, the first Chief of the Imperial Admiralty. Stosch favored a coastal defense strategy for the German fleet, and the Sachsens were intended to operate from fortified ports, from which they could sortie to attack blockading fleets. They proved to be controversial in service, as critics pointed out their poor seakeeping, tendency to roll in heavy seas, and low speed compared to earlier armored frigates. The ship was 98.20 meters 322.2 ft long overall and had a beam of 18.40 m 60.4 ft and a draft of 6.32 m 20.7 ft forward. Wurttemberg was powered by two 3 cylinder single expansion steam engines, which were supplied with steam by eight coal fired Durr boilers. The ship's top speed was 13 knots 24 km h 15 mph , at 5,600 metric horsepower 5,500 ihp . Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, though while serving as a squadron flagship this was augmented by another 7 officers and 34 men. She was armed with six 26 cm 10 in guns, two of which were single mounted in an open barbette forward of the conning tower and the remaining four mounted amidships, also on single mounts in an open barbette. As built, the ship was also equipped with six 8.7 cm 3.4 in L 24 guns and eight 3.7 cm 1.5 in Hotchkiss revolver cannons. Wurttemberg's armor was made of wrought iron, and was concentrated in an armored citadel amidships. The armor ranged from 203 to 254 mm 8.0 to 10.0 in on the armored citadel, and between 5075 mm 2.03.0 in on the deck. The barbette armor was 254 mm of wrought iron backed by 250 mm of teak. Wurttemberg was ordered by the Imperial Navy under the contract name D, which denoted that the vessel was a new addition to the fleet. She was built at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin her keel was laid down in 1876 under yard number 78. The ship was launched on 9 November 1878 and was commissioned into the German fleet on 9 May 1881. Along with her three sisters, Wurttemberg was the first large, armored warship built for the German navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion. After her commissioning, Wurttemberg was placed in reserve. She was not activated for service with the fleet until 1884 this in part had to do with the poor performance of her sister Sachsen in the fleet maneuvers of 1880. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. Nevertheless, Wurttemberg and her three sisters served as I Division in the 1884 fleet maneuvers, under the command of Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts. The ship was again placed in reserve in 1885, but returned to fleet service in 1886 alongside Sachsen, Baden, and the new ironclad Oldenburg. During the annual fleet maneuvers, Wurttemberg's engines proved troublesome. Following the 1886 maneuvers, Wurttemberg and her three sisters were removed from active duty to serve as the Baltic reserve division. In June 1887, Germany dedicated the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal Wurttemberg was among the ships present during the celebrations. The ship returned to active service with the fleet in 1890 when she joined I Division during the annual maneuvers. Wurttemberg was commanded by Captain Alfred von Tirpitz during the exercises. The eight ships of I and II Divisions simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel, which was defended by torpedo boat flotillas. Wurttemberg was in reserve during the 1891 maneuvers, but returned to I Division in 1892, 1893, and 1894. By the winter of 18941895, the last of the four Brandenburg class battleships had been commissioned these ships were assigned to I Division, which displaced Wurttemberg and her three sisters to II Division. The eight ships conducted training cruises over the winter and spring before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises. On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic, eight years after work had begun. Wurttemberg and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, attended the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high seas battle between I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the Baltic. Wurttemberg again served during the 1896 and 1897 maneuvers, though Sachsen was her only sister to join the exercises. Baden and Bayern were out of service for extensive modernization. After the conclusion of the 1897 maneuvers, Wurttemberg was taken into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for reconstruction. The ship's old wrought iron and teak armor was replaced with new Krupp nickel steel armor. The four funnels were trunked into a single large funnel and new engines were also installed, which increased the ship's speed to 15.4 knots 28.5 km h 17.7 mph . The ship's 8.7 cm guns were replaced with quick firing 8.8 cm 3.5 in SK L 30 guns and four 3.7 cm 1.5 in autocannons. Work was completed in 1898. Wurttemberg remained with the fleet until 1906 her replacement in the fleet organization plan, the new dreadnought battleship Rheinland, was ordered that year. Wurttemberg was then used as a torpedo training and test ship until February 1919, when she was reduced to an escort for F type minesweepers. The ship was stricken from the naval register on 20 October 1920 and sold to Hattinger Co. Wurttemberg was ultimately broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20W%C3%BCrttemberg%20%281878%29
"WWE 2K is a series of professional wrestling video games that are currently developed by Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. These series of games are based on the sport of professional wrestling, more specifically, World Wrestling Entertainment, which features the professional wrestling match types, storylines, and playable characters wrestlers . Every game produced in the WWE 2K series until 2019 was developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. From 2000 to 2012, the publisher was THQ. The game engine was originally based on the one used by the Japanese professional wrestling video game series Toukon Retsuden, which was also developed by Yuke's. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw, the only communication possible in season mode was through subtitles. Voice over, however, was included in season mode with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. RAW. WWE superstars record a script, which is then assigned to the voice of the corresponding superstar in the game. With the exception of WWE SmackDown Here Comes the Pain, pre recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of WWF SmackDown Just Bring It. Yuke's studios in Yokohama, Japan worked with WWE writers to create storylines for the season modes of each game. When WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 was released for more than one console, Yuke's had to port their original game codes that make up each game mode and graphic designs to a new game engine that supported the new consoles. When new features are added to WWE 2K games, developers have to create new gaming codes for the features. Along with the features, the developers have to test the game for any errors. An improvement done yearly by Yuke's with each release of a WWE 2K game is the polygon count for the 3D models of the superstars in each game. Technical limitations had occurred through the series which lead the developers to adjust custom characters while loading. Beginning with WWE '12, promotion render art photos were used up to WWE 2K16 from WWE 2K17 on, the promotion render art was replaced with in game rendering to accommodate created characters to lessen loading times. The in game announcer calls out the names when selecting the wrestler beginning in WWE 2K17 and continues through WWE 2K18 now in WWE 2K19 as for the in game render photos in the 2k19 title, the wrestlers stand still without posing differently than the previous two installments. During the Wrestlers' entrances whether solo tag team or trio tag team the commentary is expanded to an extensive library of words relative to the real life counterparts of WWE superstars. In August 2019 publisher 2K confirmed Yukes would no longer be working on the WWE 2K series. The news marked the first time the Japanese studio hadnt been actively involved in the creation of a mainline WWE title for almost 20 years. The series was originally named SmackDown , after WWE's own SmackDown television program. The first release in the series was WWF SmackDown in March 2000, which along with these subsequent titles, remained exclusive to Sony's PlayStation consoles. After the brand extension, the series was retitled SmackDown vs. Raw in 2004, to indicate the Raw brand was also featured. Within a few years, the series had expanded to a yearly release cycle for various seventh generation consoles as well as mobile devices. Yuke's had also released the games in Japan under the name of Exciting Pro Wrestling. However, after SmackDown vs. Raw 2006, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the Japanese releases adopted the western name. The series was later renamed as just simply WWE, starting from 2011 and 2012. After THQ's dissolution in January 2013, it was reported that the publishing rights for the WWE video game series were acquired by Take Two Interactive. Take Two confirmed the acquisition in February, saying that it would also retain the services of Yuke's and the THQ staff that worked on the WWE series. WWE 2K14 is the first game to be released under the 2K brand. In 2018, 2K Sports and WWE had signed a multi year contract extension that now runs through 2025 also noted, that a 3 year transitional console agreement was also purposed due to the development of future titles in the series likely to be transfer to Gen 9 systems in years to come. The T.C.A. runs until October 2021 this contract also affects the NBA 2K titles as well as the PS4 and Xbox One will continue to have installments of both series' up until the T.C.A. is ended. The first game in the series, WWF SmackDown had a clear cut system for moves such as combining an arrow key with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an arrow key with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from WWF SmackDown 2 Know Your Role to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 used the aforementioned control scheme. When WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007 was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called Ultimate Control moves. Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, in order for players to force a superstar to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker towards the end of the meter labeled Submit , and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards Escape . Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold. Every game in the SmackDown vs. Raw series used to have the amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, measured with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashedthe more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more likely it is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more likely it is for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on screen referee in WWF SmackDown Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included. Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw was the option of fighting dirty or clean . When players select dirty , the superstar is booed by the audience in the game conversely, the clean superstar is cheered by the audience. With the dirty or clean option comes the inclusion of performing a special maneuver when playing. Players using a dirty superstar must direct their superstar into building up their dirty meter by performing dirty tactics, such as attacking the referee or taking the pad off the ring's turnbuckle. Unlike performing dirty tactics, clean superstars build their meters by performing clean tactics, such as an aerial technique or performing a taunt. When dirty superstars' meters build up, they are able to perform a signature low blow likewise, clean superstars can perform their signature move at double its normal damage. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 was the inclusion of a stamina system, which was a measure of the superstars' stamina. The stamina system was measured by a meter on the HUD the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, the superstar fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 and was disabled until 2K took over the series, with 2K16. The weak strong grapple system from the past games was removed from WWE '12 onwards. Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. Dynamic Comebacks gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New wake up taunts bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move such as pounding on the ground before RKO finishing maneuver . Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a Breaking Point submission minigame. OMG moments were introduced to WWE '13. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show, super heavyweights like now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite , players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings Quick , Normal and Epic will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected. To overhaul the gameplay of the series, 2K15 features five times the animation data of WWE 2K14, containing over fifty days work of motion capture by the WWE superstars. Over four times the amount of dialogue for commentary was recorded. The general gameplay of the game too has been revised, with the wrestlers being divided once more into classes, as was present in the Smackdown vs. Raw series. This creates what is known as in ring psychology . The classes brawlers, giants, grapplers and high flyers all provide different and unique sensations within the game to provide more diverse mechanics. In addition, the game's overall core mechanics have been fundamentally altered. WWE 2K16 introduces Working Holds, which allows the player to go through a collar elbow tie up situation in order to either damage the opponent or regain stamina to reverse the tide in the match. Dirty Pins now come in various animations and also A.I. for the referee is improved for example, they break up collar elbow tie ups when the wrestlers are holding each other at the corner for too long. The Reversal Limit system was introduced to prevent players from reversing throughout the match, they come as minor and major ones depending on the class of the wrestler diva. This method can be toggled on off in the Options section. WWE 2K17 retains the control scheme from the previous title but implements two styles of submissions. Ladders can now be propped many of ways, OMG's such as Kevin Owens' Apron Pop Up Powerbomb makes its debut and a new mini game involving the Money in the Bank Briefcase to name a few features changes the aesthetics to ladder matches. WWE 2K18 re works the carrying system. High Flying moves such as elbow drops are performed faster and attack animations are massively improved. There's also new corner finishers such as Randy Orton's Corner RKO and John Cena's Corner AA. WWE 2K19 introduces the Payback engine, which gives advantages after being down in a match to reverse the tide such as Auto Reversal, spraying Green Mist or storing finishers to name a few. WWE 2K20 streamlines the controls for newbie players yet more concise and simple for the veterans. Paybacks make their return with tweaks and new versions of paybacks are introduced. In the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series, the player was able to choose a superstar from a roster and compete in an arcade like feature called season mode. In season mode, players direct their superstars through different career obstacles through a year of WWE programming to gain respect with other superstars and popularity among the fans. Like superstars from WWE, the superstars in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series season mode are involved in storylines that affect their career mode in some way. Beginning with the release of WWE SmackDown Shut Your Mouth, the WWE Brand Extension has been included in season mode, and superstars are exclusive to one brand of WWE. A result of this feature is that the player's superstar may only wrestle superstars and compete for championships from the same brand on which he is a part of. In season mode, the player's superstar has the ability to earn and wrestle for a variety of championships based on actual WWE Championships. When superstars win championships, their respect and popularity increase, which also increases their involvement in main event matches. As the superstar's respect and popularity increases through the year of WWE programming, it becomes more likely for the player to achieve the main goal in season mode, which is to earn a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania, the WWE's flagship pay per view event and the final stage in season mode. After the final stage, season modes begins again with the same superstar chosen before, though the player has the option of switching superstars. The superstar is then a part of the WWE Draft Lottery and is assigned to a brand. Season mode was replaced with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single player or multi player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade like than the former season mode was. Road to WrestleMania was replaced with Attitude Era Mode in WWE '13. This single player mode is an abridged recreation of a memorable time in sports entertainment, allowing players to journey through various storylines as eight of the most popular superstars of that time, including Stone Cold Steve Austin and Dwayne The Rock Johnson. The chapter based saga moves through WWE's struggle and eventual triumph during the Monday Night Wars, which saw the company on the brink of defeat at the hands of a powerful rival, WCW. Told from the perspective of the WWE during that period, matches and in game cutscenes are supplemented by video packages assembled by WWE's own editors. In WWE 2K14, a single player campaign titled The 30 Years of WrestleMania was introduced, a nostalgic gameplay mode that recreates nearly three decades of WWE history, including 46 matches, classic WWE footage and many legendary characters. The mode features a distinct roster of wrestlers and alternate gimmicks, who wrestled at WrestleMania. In this mode matches have primary objectives, required to beat the game, and bonus historical objectives, which result in recreated WrestleMania moments. Sometimes the player must follow a guided sequence of inputs, rather than freely control the character. The player competes through storylines of various lengths, switching predetermined characters as they are completed. Each chapter has its own title and focus Hulkamania Runs Wild focuses on Hulk Hogan and early WrestleManias, while The New Generation showcases the rise of Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels in the mid 1990s. The Attitude Era chapter brings back some matches from WWE '13's Attitude Era mode, as well as some not covered before. The Ruthless Aggression chapter focuses on the departure of The Rock, lessened focus on Triple H and rise of Randy Orton and Edge. The final Universe Era chapter focuses on the rise of John Cena and the returns of The Rock and Brock Lesnar. The video packages provided detailed the intro to Wrestlemania, Wrestlemania III, Wrestlemania V, which background glimpses IV, Wrestlemania VI, Wrestlemania VIII, an intro to the New Generation Era leading to Wrestlemania X also another promoting X, Wrestlemania XII, a video opening the Attitude Era leading to XIV, Wrestlemania 2000, Wrestlemania X Seven, two videos about Wrestlemania X8, two about Wrestlemania XIX, two of Wrestlemania XX, Wrestlemania 23, Wrestlemania XXIV, A interchange video regarding the Ruthless Aggression Era to the Universe Era opening for XXV, Wrestlemania XXVI, Wrestlemania 27, next, a video of Wrestlemania 27, which crosses into XXVIII and another of XXVIII which culminates the first battle between the Rock and John Cena. Videos for XXIX was not included as three important matches were just finished at that event in the same year when the game was released. The matches were Undertaker vs. CM Punk Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar The Rock vs. John Cena for the Reality Era WWE Championship. The last video was an overlook of what happened throughout the decades showing some events going to the future of that pay per view. WWE 2K15 features the 2K Showcase, the core stories include CM Punk vs. John Cena Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels. These rivalries detail from 2002 to 2004 Triple H and Shawn Michaels and 2011 to 2013 CM Punk and John Cena .

And lastly, the One More Match story, which stars captain charisma, Christian as he complained about having one more match as his way of getting multiple second chances of earning the World Heavyweight Championship. Originally, these stories were meant to be produced for WWE '12, WWE '13 WWE 2K14, but the developers chose to use WWE '12 for Road to Wrestlemania, the Attitude Era for WWE '13 and 30 years of Wrestlemania for WWE 2K14. WWE 2K16 details the historical career of Steve Austin, from his days at ECW when he was angry that things were not going to happen in a good sense for him to WCW when he and Brian Pillman began to become a strong tag team leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti hero that was not going to be tame into a corporate man.

Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in one on one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 , players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature. In WWE 2k19, 2k Towers have been introduced for offline and online some implemented to assist Road to Glory mode the Wyatt Compound is used in a backstage brawl match this is also a integral area in the MyCareer Mode . In WWE 2k20, Lobbies return with quick matchmaking and more responsiveness for Road to Glory mode. Every game in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series includes a roster of superstars and Divas based on superstars who compete for WWE. Every year, WWE acquires new superstars and releases old superstars. As a result, every time a WWE SmackDown vs. Raw game is released, the new superstars are added into the game and the old released superstars are removed from the game to reflect the changes in the actual WWE. From the release of WWF SmackDown to the release of WWF SmackDown Just Bring It, superstars were not divided into brands. In 2002, the WWE split its entire roster into two brands of wrestling, called Raw and SmackDown , which were named after WWE's television shows. The WWE Brand Extension was first featured in WWE SmackDown Shut Your Mouth. In 2006, WWE launched a new brand, called ECW, which was named after the original Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion. The new ECW brand was first featured in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008. WWE holds an annual draft lottery, in which WWE superstars switch brands. The games in production when the draft occurs include the changes that take place in the draft. For example, when WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was in production during June 2007, the 2007 WWE Draft took place, and the draft changes were included in the video game. Another brand of wrestling included in the series is the legends program, which was first included with the release of WWE SmackDown Here Comes the Pain. Popular WWE alumni or members of the WWE Hall of Fame have been included since then under the legends program. This was featured up until the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, as alumni and Hall of Fame members were not featured in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 due to production of WWE Legends of WrestleMania. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 was also the first game to feature characters as downloadable content. WWE '12 has 56 wrestlers and 78 by DLC, WWE '13 with 84 and 107 by DLC, WWE 2K14 with 82 and 103 by DLC, WWE 2K15 with 76 and 113 with DLC, WWE 2K16 with 133 including DLC giving this title the highest character roster in the video game's history with 165. WWE 2K17 carries 145 for the physical disc versions for PS3 and Xbox 360 150 for the NXT Edition made for PS4 Xbox One with DLC at 172. WWE 2K18 contains 197 for the standard version 202 via Deluxe and Collector's Edition with DLC announced at a later date. An update on the WWE 2K18 roster revealed on September 25, 2017, the final roster is 220 197 on disc virtually reading 204 by attires counted . WWE 2K19 has 217 characters on disc 224 via Woo Edition and 236 with DLC counted as final. WWE 2k20 has 217 characters on disc 221 via Smackdown 20th Anniversary Edition with DLC yet to be finalized. The series features a create a superstar mode, where players are able to create their own wrestler, including their move set and ring entrances. The feature was introduced when WWF SmackDown was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered the first change came with the release of WWF SmackDown 2 Know Your Role, which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in WWE SmackDown Shut Your Mouth, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2006, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for the created superstar. The feature was expanded with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects in any part of the superstar's entrance. As an addition to SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, a create a finisher mode was introduced where the player chooses up to 10 out of 500 animations combined to make their own personalised finisher. The create a finisher feature was removed on next gen consoles, starting with WWE 2K15. On the 360 and PS3 versions of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010, it is possible to change the colors of a featured superstar's attire, this new mode is known as Superstar Threads . In this game, there is also a new creation mode giving players the ability to create their designs. From WWE 2K14 alongside the Superstar Threads feature, in the Create a Superstar mode there was a new part of it called Superstar Heads . This feature allowed players to take certain in game models and modify or create a new attire for that model and use it as an alternative attire for the superstar that they have done it for. This was only available for very limited superstars and players couldn't any headgear or masks to the superstar. A DLC was soon released which featured vintage versions of some of the existing models as well as few new models. From WWE 2K15, on next generation consoles a new feature was available to players which was similar to the Superstar Heads feature that had previously featured on WWE games but this new feature was called the Superstar Studio . This new Superstar Studio allowed players to take any existing in game model and modify their attires into anything that the player desired. Whilst this was exclusive to next generation consoles, players playing on last gen consoles had the returning Superstar Heads mode which featured all of the models from 2K14 as well as a new Brock Lesnar model. WWE 2K17 brings back Highlight Replay and Create A Victory features from WWE '13 and SmackDown Here Comes the Pain respectively. WWE 2K18 introduces Create A Match where players can save changes and use them in Play Mode. The original WWF SmackDown was one of the most popular games for the PlayStation console in 2000, selling over 975,000 units for the PlayStation, and selling over one million copies in the United States. The game lost appeal due to the failing of a well established season mode that was deemed disappointing. The season mode was criticized for the lack of in depth storylines and the way superstars spoke in season mode, through putrid lines and blocked text. WWF SmackDown 2 Know Your Role received a better reception than the first WWE SmackDown game, as IGN stated that season mode actually works properly , though the audio of the game was lacking as there was no commentary, and only generic music was included in the game. WWF SmackDown Just Bring It, according to IGN, did little to improve the season mode of the game, while GameSpot stated that the addition of audio commentary detracted from the playing experience. WWE SmackDown Shut Your Mouth and WWE SmackDown Here Comes the Pain received more positive reviews from both IGN and GameSpot, both of whom cited the expanded season mode as an improvement, although flaws were still visible in the mode. It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown games, as it was written by actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that make the whole package shine. WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2 10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 received positive reviews upon release. According to video game review aggregator Metacritic, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 received favorable reviews on all platforms. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight and three sevens for the Xbox 360 version, and one five, one seven and two sixes for the PSP version. The game received praise for presentation and the high amount of content, but was criticized for glitches, including commentary and ring announcing problems, and collision detection issues, with wrestlers being able to skip climbing an occupied ladder, making the Money In The Bank match extremely difficult. For example, if one wrestler is on top of the ladder, another wrestler may suddenly superplex him, without even climbing the ladder. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 received more negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the Ultimate Control moves, Struggle system, and the ECW Extreme Rules matches. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 was rated 31st and 28th Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively in IGN's Top 100 Games list. It is among the best selling video game franchises, with 60 million copies shipped as of 2013. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 was met with mostly positive reception from numerous video game publications. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 81.29 and 80 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version 80.60 and 81 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version 79 and 78 out of 100 for the Wii version 76 and 76 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version 73.29 and 75 out of 100 for the DS version 71 and 71 out of 100 for the PSP version and 48.33 and 42 out of 100 for the iOS version. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 was met with positive to mixed reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 80 and 80 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version 77.47 and 74 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version 76.84 and 75 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version 74 and 72 out of 100 for the Wii version and 60 and 62 out of 100 for the PSP version. Greg Miller of IGN gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game an eight out of ten. He praised the game's Universe Mode and the wrestler animations, but criticized the limitations of Road to WrestleMania mode and the inaccurate commentary. In addition, he stated that the grappling system could be frustrating at times. Miller gave the Wii version of the game a 7.5 out of ten, however. He mentioned the same criticisms from the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, but also criticized the graphics. GameSpot's Chris Watters rated the PS3 and X360 versions seven out of ten, lauding the game's customization options, while finding fault with the game's collision detection and the lag during online multiplayer games. He also claimed that the series was starting to show its age. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of WWE '12 garnered mixed reviews. IGN gave the game a 9.0 out of 10, stating that the gameplay changes are breathing new life into its core mechanics . Mike D'Alonzo of G4 called it the best wrestling game ever made . However, Andy Hartup of Computer and Video Games gave the game a 6.7 out of 10 and wrote that the game, offers little more than some new gloss painted over an old product . Game Informer's Dan Ryckert echoed the sentiment, stating, Thanks to a severely downgraded story mode and a lack of substantial improvements, this is the weakest WWE title in years.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE%202K
"WWT Slimbridge is a wetland wildlife reserve near Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, England. It is midway between Bristol and Gloucester on the eastern side of the estuary of the River Severn. The reserve, set up by the artist and naturalist Sir Peter Scott, opened in November 1946. Scott subsequently founded the Wildfowl Wetlands Trust, which has since opened eight reserves around the country. Slimbridge comprises some 800 hectares 2,000 acres of pasture, reed bed, lagoon and salt marsh. Many water birds live there all year round, and others are migrants on their ways to and from their summer breeding grounds. Other birds overwinter, including large numbers of white fronted geese and increasing numbers of Bewick's swans. Besides having the world's largest collection of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities. The Wildlife and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge was set up by Peter Scott and opened on 10 November 1946, as a centre for research and conservation. In a move unusual at the time, he opened the site to the public so that everyone could enjoy access to nature. This modest beginning developed in time into the formation of the Wildfowl Wetlands Trust, the only United Kingdom charity to promote the protection of wetland birds and their habitats, both in Britain and internationally. Although starting out at Slimbridge, the Wildfowl Wetlands Trust now owns or manages eight other reserves in Britain, and advocates for wetlands and conservation issues world wide. WWT Consulting is an offshoot of the Wildlife Wetland Trust and is based at Slimbridge. It provides ecological surveys and assessments, and offers consultancy services in wetland habitat design, wetland management, biological waste water treatment systems and the management of reserves and their visitor centres. The Queen in later years became Patron to the WWT, and Prince Charles became the President. A bust of founder Sir Peter Scott by Jacqueline Shackleton was completed in 1986 and is on display in the grounds. His wife Philippa, Lady Scott, sat for Jon Edgar as part of his Environmental Series of heads, and a bronze was unveiled in the visitor centre in December 2011. A sculpture by Peter Scott's mother, Kathleen Scott, entitled Here Am I, Send Me , originally commissioned for West Downs Preparatory School, is also on display in the grounds. The site consists of 800 hectares 2,000 acres of reserve, of which part is landscaped and can be visited by the public. At Slimbridge is the largest collection of wildfowl species in the world, and wild birds mingle with these in the enclosures. Some of the captive birds form part of international breeding programmes. The reserve includes a mixture of pastureland, much of which gets flooded in winter, lagoons, reed beds and salt marshes besides the Severn Estuary. Many wildfowl visit the site including greater white fronted geese, spoonbills, avocets and even common cranes, the latter being birds that were originally bred here and later released on the Somerset Levels. There are also some rare species of plant on the reserve including the grass poly Lythrum hyssopifolia and the wasp orchid, a variant of the bee orchid Ophrys apifera . The number of ducks, geese and swans is greatest in winter, with large flocks of greater white fronted geese, sometimes with a rare lesser white fronted goose amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, and it is a good place to see the elusive water rail. Species present all year round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, sparrowhawk and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart. Swans and geese usually start to arrive in late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white fronted geese, large waterfowl regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off in the day and return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff. Before the establishment of the WWT reserve at Slimbridge, no Bewick's swans were regularly wintering on the Severn Estuary. In 1948, one arrived at Slimbridge, perhaps attracted by a captive whistling swan. A mate for this bird was acquired from the Netherlands and the pair eventually successfully bred. More wild Bewick's swans joined the group so that by 1964, more than thirty wild swans were present. So that the birds could be better studied, the tame resident swans were relocated to an easily observable lake. Peter Scott realised that every bird had a unique patterning of black and yellow on its beak by which individual birds could be recognised. These were recorded in small paintings with front and side views rather like mug shots to aid recognition. By 1989, over six thousand swans had been recorded visiting the site, and by this means, much research was made possible on the birds. An early success story in the 1950s was the saving of the nene or Hawaiian goose from extinction. Birds were brought to the site and breeding at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible. During Princess Elizabeth's 1951 tour of Canada, she was promised a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the arrangements to be made by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia as they had been fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos . One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years. Slimbridge has also been involved in trying to increase population levels of common cranes, which had bred spasmodically in Britain since the late 1970s. A specially built Crane School is used where the young birds are taught to forage and avoid danger. This project has led to 23 birds being released onto the Somerset Moors and Levels in September 2013, and 93 being released by the end of 2015. In September 2016, a researcher from Slimbridge is planning to become a human swan and follow migrating Bewick's swans using a powered paraglider. She plans to try to find out the hazards they face during migration and why their numbers have halved in the last twenty years. The 4,500 mi 7,200 km mission from the Arctic tundra of Russia to Slimbridge is expected to last for ten weeks. The Sloane Observation Tower gives far reaching views to the Cotswold escarpment in the east and the River Severn and Forest of Dean in the West. The 6.2m visitor centre has a shop, waterside restaurant, cinema, art gallery and tropical house, and exhibitions are held in the Hanson Discovery Centre . There are sixteen hides that visitors can use for bird watching, as well as several comfortable observatories. Educational visits are available for schools and there is a programme of guided walks, events, talks and workshops. Visitors are allowed to feed the captive birds with approved food mixes bought on site, and during the winter, feeding of wild birds near one of the hides takes place at certain scheduled times, including on some floodlit occasions in the evening for visiting groups.

"WWV is a shortwave also known as high frequency HF radio station, located near Fort Collins, Colorado. It is best known for its continuous time signal broadcasts begun in 1945, and is also used to establish official United States government frequency standards, with transmitters operating on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. WWV is operated by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST , under the oversight of its Time and Frequency Division, which is part of NIST's Physical Measurement Laboratory based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. WWV was first established in 1919 by the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., and has been described as the oldest continuously operating radio station in the United States. In 1931 it relocated to the first of three suburban Maryland sites, before moving to its current location near Fort Collins in 1966. WWV shares this site with longwave also known as low frequency LF station WWVB, which transmits carrier and time code no voice at 60 kHz. NIST also operates the similarly structured WWVH on Kauai, Hawaii. Both WWV and WWVH announce the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements of general interest on an hourly schedule, including the Global Positioning System GPS satellite constellation status. Because they simultaneously transmit on the same frequencies, WWV uses a male voice in order to differentiate itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice. NIST has announced plans to celebrate WWV's centennial on October 1, 2019. See web site for celebration plans WWV, along with WWVB and WWVH, was recommended for defunding and elimination in NIST's Fiscal Year 2019 budget request. However, the final 2019 NIST budget preserved funding for the three stations. Since 1945 WWV has disseminated official U.S. time , as provided by government entities such as NIST and the United States Naval Observatory USNO , to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge beyond the cost of the receiving equipment. The time signals generated by WWV allow time keeping devices such as radio controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations including shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and telecommunications. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as amateur radio operators. WWV broadcasts over six transmitters, each one dedicated for use on a single frequency. The transmitting frequencies and time signals of WWV, WWVB and WWVH, along with the four atomic cesium clocks from which their time signals are derived, are maintained by NIST's Time and Frequency Division, which is based in nearby Boulder, Colorado. WWVB's carrier frequency is maintained to an accuracy of 1 part in 1014 and can be used as a frequency reference. The broadcast time is accurate to within 100 ns of UTC and 20 ns of the national time standard. The transmitters for 2.5 MHz, 20 MHz, and the experimental 25 MHz put out an ERP of 2.5 kW, while those for the other three frequencies use 10 kW of ERP. Each transmitter is connected to a dedicated antenna, which has a height corresponding to approximately one half of its signal's wavelength, and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional. The top half of each antenna tower contains a quarter wavelength radiating element, and the bottom half uses nine guy wires, connected to the midpoint of the tower and sloped at one to one from the groundwith a length of 2 4 times the wavelengthas additional radiating elements. WWV's time signal can also be accessed by telephone by calling 1 303 499 7111 WWV or 1 808 335 4363 for WWVH. An equivalent time service operated by the United States Naval Observatory can be accessed by calling 1 202 762 1401 Washington, D.C. . Telephone calls are limited to 2 minutes and 35 seconds, and the signal is delayed by an average of 30 milliseconds due to telephone network propagation time. On top of the standard carrier frequencies, WWV carries additional information using standard double sideband amplitude modulation. WWV's transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute. They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them. Because they are so similar, both are described here. WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows In both cases the transmitted time is given in Coordinated Universal Time UTC . WWV transmits audio ticks once per second, to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization. These ticks are always transmitted, even during voice announcements and silent periods. Each tick begins on the second, lasts 5 ms and consists of 5 cycles of a 1,000 Hz sine wave. To make the tick stand out more, all other signals are suppressed for 40 ms, from 10 ms before the second until 30 ms after 25 ms after the tick . As an exception, no tick and no silent interval is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute. In the event of a leap second, no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute, either. On the minute, the tick is extended to a 0.8 second long beep, followed by 0.2 s of silence. On the hour, this minute pulse is transmitted at 1,500 Hz rather than 1,000. The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute. Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute, the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling some of the once per second ticks, transmitting a second tick 100 ms after the first. The second tick preempts other transmissions, but does not get a silent zone. The absolute value of this difference, in tenths of a second, is determined by the number of doubled ticks. The sign is determined by the position If the doubled ticks begin at second one, UT1 is ahead of UTC if they begin at second nine, UT1 is behind UTC. WWVH transmits similar 5 ms ticks, but they are sent as six cycles of 1,200 Hz. The minute beep is also 1,200 Hz, except on the hour when it is 1,500 Hz. The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100 modulation 0 dBc . Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute, giving the time of the following minute beep. The format for the voice announcement is, At the tone, X hour s , Y minute s , Coordinated Universal Time. The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7.5 seconds before the minute tone. WWVH makes an identical time announcement, starting 15 seconds before the minute tone, in a female voice. When voice announcements were first instituted, they were phrased as follows National Bureau of Standards, WWV when the tone returns, Eastern Standard Time is time in 12 hour format . After the 1967 switch to GMT, the announcement changed to National Bureau of Standards, WWV, Fort Collins, Colorado next tone begins at X hours, Y minute s , Greenwich Mean Time. However, this format would be short lived. The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971. At the tone, X hour s , Y minute s , Greenwich Mean Time. The name Greenwich Mean Time was changed to Coordinated Universal Time in 1974. Voice time announcements are sent at 75 modulation 1.25 dBc , i.e., the carrier varies between 25 and 175 of nominal power. WWV transmits the following 44 second voice announcements in lieu of the standard frequency tones on an hourly schedule Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone, but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule. WWV and WWVH's voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk WWV airs dead air when WWVH airs voice announcements, and vice versa. WWVH's storm warnings cover the area around the Hawaiian islands and the Far East rather than North America. WWV identifies itself twice each hour, at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour. The text of the identification is as follows National Institute of Standards and Technology time this is Radio Station WWV, Fort Collins Colorado, broadcasting on internationally allocated standard carrier frequencies of two point five, five, ten, fifteen, and twenty megahertz, providing time of day, standard time interval, and other related information. Inquiries regarding these transmissions may be directed to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Radio Station WWV, 2000 East County Road 58, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80524. WWV accepts reception reports sent to the address mentioned in the station ID, and responds with QSL cards. WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tones during most minutes. They begin after the 1 second minute mark and continues until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute. Even numbered minutes except for minute 2 transmit 500 Hz, while 600 Hz is heard during odd numbered minutes. The tone is interrupted for 40 ms each second by the second ticks. WWVH is similar, but exchanges the two tones. WWV also transmits a 440 Hz tone, a pitch commonly used in music A440, the musical note A above middle C during minute 2 of each hour, except for the first hour of the UTC day. Since the 440 Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour, many chart recorders may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day, and likewise, the omission of the 440 Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty four hour period. WWVH transmits the same tone during minute 1 of each hour. No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes 43 through 51 inclusive and minutes 29 and 59 of each hour. Likewise, WWVH transmits no tone during minutes 0, 8, 9, 10, 14 through 19, and 30. Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50 modulation 3 dBc . Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital time code, interpretable by radio controlled clocks. The time code uses a 100 Hz subcarrier of the main signal. That is, it is an additional low level 100 Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals. This code is similar to, and has the same framework as, the IRIG H time code and the time code that WWVB transmits, except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first. Like the IRIG timecode, the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute. Also like the IRIG timecode, numeric data minute, hour, day of year, and last two digits of year are sent in binary coded decimal BCD format rather than as simple binary integers Each decimal digit is sent as two, three, or four bits depending on its possible range of values . The 100 Hz subcarrier is transmitted at 15 dBc 18 modulation beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick , and then reduced by 15 dB to 30 dBc, 3 modulation at one of three times within the second. The duration of the high amplitude 100 Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0, a data bit of 1, or a marker , as follows A single bit or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first second 00 . The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker, previously described. In the diagram above, the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100 Hz subcarrier, with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier 15 dB referenced to 100 modulation and red the lower strength subcarrier 30 dB referenced to 100 modulation . The widest yellow bars represent the markers, the narrowest represent data bits with value 0, and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value 1. It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code. Most of the bits encode UTC time, day of year, year of century, and UT1 correction up to 0.7 s. Like the WWVB time code, only the tens and units digits of the year are transmitted unlike the WWVB time code, there is no direct indication for leap year. Thus, receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year correct for year 2000 will be incorrect in the year 2100. On the other hand, receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through 2399. The table below shows the interpretation of each bit, with the Ex column being the values from the example above. The example shown encodes day 86 March 27 of 2009, at 21 30 00 UTC. DUT1 is 0.3, so UT1 is 21 30 00.3. Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00 00 UTC DST1 0 , and will not be in effect at the next 00 00 UTC DST2 0 . There is no leap second scheduled LSW 0 . The day of year normally runs from 1 January 1 through 365 December 31 , but in leap years, December 31 would be day 366, and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27. The time code contains three bits announcing daylight saving time DST changes and imminent leap seconds. If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ, DST is changing during the current UTC day, at the next 02 00 local time. Before the next 02 00 local time after that, the bits will be the same. Each change in the DST bits happens at 00 00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16 00 PST and 20 00 EDT , depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end. A receiver in the Eastern time zone UTC5 must therefore correctly receive the DST is changing indication within the seven hours before DST begins, and six hours before DST ends, if it is to change the local time display at the correct time. Receivers in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones have one, two, and three more hours of advance notice, respectively. During a leap second, a binary zero is transmitted in the time code in this case, the minute will not be preceded by a marker. The earliest formal record of WWV's existence is in the October 1, 1919 issue of the Department of Commerce's Radio Service Bulletin, where it is listed as a new experimental station assigned to the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C, with the randomly issued call letters of WWV. However, there were also earlier reports of radio demonstrations by the Bureau, starting the previous February. As of May 1920 the Bureau's Radio Laboratory was reported to be conducting weekly Friday evening concerts from 8 30 to 11 00, transmitting on 600 kHz. That same month, the Bureau demonstrated a portable radio receiver, called the portaphone , which was said to be capable of receiving broadcast programs for up to 15 miles 24 km away. A newspaper article the following August reported that the weekly concerts could be heard up to 100 miles 160 km from Washington. However, it also noted that The bureau has been experimenting with the wireless music for several months, and has reached such an advanced stage of development that further investigation to them is useless, and they are going to discontinue the concerts. However, the station continued to make occasional broadcasts, and in January 1921 a new distance record was reported when a listener in Chattanooga, Tennessee heard the jazzy waves whirling out from the Bureau of Standards . On December 15, 1920, WWV began broadcasting 500 word Daily Radio Marketgrams , prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Markets, in Morse code on 750 kHz, which reportedly could be heard up to 200 miles 320 km from Washington. However, on April 15, 1921 responsibility for the reports was transferred to four stations operated by the Post Office Department, including its WWX in Washington, D.C. At the end of 1922, WWV's purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals. These were an important aid to broadcasting and amateur stations, because their equipment limitations at the time meant they had difficulty staying on their assigned frequencies. Testing began on January 29, 1923. Regularly scheduled operations began on March 6, 1923, initially consisting of seven transmitting frequencies ranging from 550 to 1500 kHz wavelengths of 545 to 200 meters . The frequencies were accurate to better than three tenths of one percent . At first, the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next, using a wavemeter. The first quartz resonators that stabilized the frequency generating oscillators were invented in the mid 1920s, and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV's frequency broadcasts. In 1926, WWV was nearly shut down. Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States, and other stations located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5 MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937. WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6, 1940. The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered, and the station was back on the air with reduced power on November 11. Congress funded a new station in July 1941, and it was built 5 kilometres 3.1 mi south of the former location, still referred to as Beltsville although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt, Maryland . WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 MHz on August 1, 1943. Beginning in 1913 the primary official time station broadcasting in the eastern United States was the Navy's NAA in Arlington, Virginia, however NAA was decommissioned in 1941. WWV began broadcasting second pulses in 1937, but initially these were not tied to actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO's clock as a source for its time signals. Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Audio frequencies of 600 Hz and 440 Hz were employed during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 MHz. The 30 and 35 MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953. A binary coded decimal time code began testing in 1960, and became permanent in 1961. This NASA time code was modulated onto a 1000 Hz audio tone at 100 Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated baaga bong . The code was also described as sounding like a buzz saw . On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast was changed to the present 100 Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder . WWV moved to its present location near Fort Collins on December 1, 1966, enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States. WWVB signed on in that location three years earlier. In April 1967, WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site Eastern Time until 1966, and Mountain Time afterwards and switched to broadcasting Greenwich Mean Time or GMT. The station switched again, to Coordinated Universal Time UTC , in 1974. The 20 and 25 MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977, but the 20 MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year. Starting on April 4, 2014, the 25 MHz signal was back on the air in an 'experimental' mode but has since been dropped again. The voice used on WWV was that of professional broadcaster Don Elliott Heald until August 13, 1991, when equipment changes required re recording the announcer's voice. The one used at that time was that of another professional broadcaster, John Doyle, but was soon switched to the voice of KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers, since then John Doyle's voice has been returned to the broadcast. WWV's 20 MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958 to track the disintegration of Russian satellite Sputnik 1 after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.

"Originally named USS Tippecanoe, after the river in Indiana, USS Wyandotte was a single turreted Canonicus class monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War. Completed after the end of the war, Wyandotte was laid up until 1876, although she received her new name in 1869. The ship was commissioned in 1876 and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron for the next three years. She became a receiving ship in 1879 until she was placed in reserve again in 1885. Wyandotte was on militia duty when the SpanishAmerican War began and she was recommissioned in 1898 to defend Boston, Massachusetts from any Spanish raiders. The ship was decommissioned after the end of the war and sold for scrap in 1899. The ship was 224 feet 6 inches 68.4 m long overall, had a beam of 43 feet 5 inches 13.2 m and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 3 inches 4.0 m . Wyandotte had a tonnage of 1,034 tons burthen and displaced 2,100 long tons 2,100 t . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men. Wyandotte was powered by a two cylinder horizontal vibrating lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire tube boilers. The 320 indicated horsepower 240 kW engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots 15 km h 9.2 mph . She carried 140150 long tons 140150 t of coal. Wyandotte's main armament consisted of two smoothbore, muzzle loading, 15 inch 381 mm Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret. Each gun weighed approximately 43,000 pounds 20,000 kg . They could fire a 350 pound 158.8 kg shell up to a range of 2,100 yards 1,900 m at an elevation of 7. The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of 1 inch 25 mm wrought iron plates, backed by wood. The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one inch plates. The ship's deck was protected by armor 1.5 inches 38 mm thick. A 5 by 15 inch 130 by 380 mm soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened to several of the older Passaic class monitors during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. The base of the funnel ship was protected to a height of 6 feet 1.8 m by 8 inches 200 mm of armor. A rifle screen of 12 inch 13 mm armor 3 feet 0.9 m high was installed on the top of the turret to protected the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven, captain of her sister ship Tecumseh. The only known modification after the ship's completion was the addition of a hurricane deck between the turret and the funnel sometime after the end of the Civil War. The contract for Wyandotte, the only Navy ship to be named after the Wyandotte Indian Tribe, was awarded to Miles Greenwood the ship was laid down on 28 September 1862 at the shipyard of John Litherbury in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was launched on 22 December 1864 and completed on 15 February 1866. The ship's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors. This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches 203 mm to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret. Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches 457 mm to increase the ship's buoyancy, moving the position of the turret to balance the ship's trim and replacing all of the ship's deck armor. Completion of the ship was further delayed by the low depth of the Ohio River which prevented her movement from Cincinnati in December 1864 to finish their fitting out. The river finally rose in March 1865 which allowed the ship to reach New Albany, Indiana on 14 March. Wyandotte was moved to Evansville, Indiana in late May to complete her hull where rudimentary facilities and illness among her workers delayed her construction still further. The monitor joined her sisters Oneota, Manayunk, and Catawba in ordinary opposite Cairo, Illinois when she was completed on 15 February 1866 although they drew enough water that they had to be anchored in the main channel where they were often struck by debris, drifting ice, and were vulnerable to accidents. Wyandotte's anchor chain was broken on 27 March when she was struck by a steamboat towing barges and the ship collided with Oneota and the two ships were dragged 2 miles 3.2 km downstream before they could be brought under control. This was a persistent problem and the Navy finally decided to move the ships down to New Orleans in May 1866. In 1869, she was twice renamed, first to Vesuvius on 15 June and then Wyandotte on 10 August. The monitor was moved to Key West, Florida in 1870 and then to the Philadelphia Navy Yard by 1872. In 187374, Wyandotte was thoroughly overhauled by John Roach Sons in Chester, Pennsylvania and commissioned for the first time on 24 January 1876, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas C. Terrell. The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron through 1879 and spent her time on exercises and training cruises she was based at Hampton Roads, Virginia for a while. She served as the station ship at Washington, D.C., beginning in 1879, before she was again placed in reserve in 1885, first at Richmond, Virginia and then at Norfolk, Virginia. Wyandotte was transferred to the Connecticut Naval Militia in 1896, and she was recommissioned for local defense duties on 30 April 1898 during the SpanishAmerican War in response to political pressure. Commanded by Lt. John B. Milton, the ship sailed from New Haven, Connecticut on 17 May, to guard Boston and remained on there from 19 May to 5 September. Wyandotte sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after the end of the war and arrived there on 9 September. She was decommissioned on 20 September and sold for scrap on 17 January 1899.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%20Wyandotte%20%281864%29
"Amy Wyatt is a fictional character from the British soap opera Emmerdale, played by Natalie Ann Jamieson. She debuted on screen during the episode airing on 8 October 2010, played by Chelsea Halfpenny. Since her inception Amy has been central to main storylines and has been played as the serial's rebellious teenager. Halfpenny has said she enjoys playing the character's mischievous side. Amy's unstable upbringing in children's homes and foster care has impacted on her persona. She is a troubled character and protects herself by creating a hard exterior. Amy's biggest fear is embarrassment and she aspires to lead a normal family life with her foster parents Val Pollard and Eric Pollard. As her storylines have developed she has grown close to the pair, yet rebelled at various stages. Charlie Hardwick and Chris Chittell who play Val and Eric have expressed their delight with the positive impact Amy has had on their on screen family. She has a kooky style and wears heavy make up. Other stories for the character include blackmail, one night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant by the serial's villain Cain Dingle. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the fear of losing her new found family increases. Halfpenny announced her departure from Emmerdale in October 2013, and she departed on 14 November 2013. The character was reintroduced on 7 March 2019, with Natalie Ann Jamieson now in the role. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Jane Simon from the Daily Mail said her first scenes resembled a horror movie, while her colleague Jaci Stephen has opined that Amy wears too much make up. However, entertainment website Digital Spy has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three Best Newcomer awards for her portrayal of Amy. Series producer Gavin Blyth first mentioned Amy's arrival in June 2010. He said the characters of Val Charlie Hardwick and Eric Pollard Chris Chittell faced a fascinating future with the arrival of a fresh faced stranger who takes a shine to the pair. Amy debuted on screen on 8 October 2010 when she found herself stranded outside the village. She later moves in with Val and Eric and attempts to rebuild her life. Amy is a happy character with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in foster care it shows in her persona. Though it is often hard for people to understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a hard exterior . Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite out there in her choice of clothing and make up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's nice side and reminded them that she is good at lying and scheming . She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface. Halfpenny on Amy 2011 After Val and Eric foster Amy, she starts acting rebellious again. She starts drinking and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails because she is convinced everything goes wrong in her life. She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first. Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe Matthew Wolfenden grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is light hearted. However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has gone too far and question their ability to cope with her. Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys. Off screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel were thrilled by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has freshened the whole place up. In comparison, David was initially hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David has a soft spot for Amy and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his little sister. When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding Roxy Shahidi accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher Natalie Anderson as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up. Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden Isabel Hodgins , claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home. Halfpenny revealed that Amy genuinely liked David and thought the feeling was mutual. She wouldn't do it to embarrass herself i think that is one of Amy's biggest fears being embarrassed. When David tracks Amy down she blackmails him in return for the truth but David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a good relationship . Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because deep down he really cares about her. The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy meeting her match. As nothing is straight forward with Amy , she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes Philip Hill Pearson arrives and blackmails Amy. An Emmerdale spokesperson revealed that Amy had an affair with Jared's father and ruined his family. Shes got herself in a mess and this is just the start of her problems. Amy steals from Val and Eric to pay Jared off. At this point in the story Val and Eric are sick of Amy's bad behaviour. Val refuses to give her any more help. Halfpenny on the pregnancy storyline. 2011 Amy's role in the serial increased with her much publicised pregnancy storyline. The plot begins when Amy has sex with Cain Dingle Jeff Hordley . Halfpenny said It's Amy who takes the lead and it goes from there. Hordley explained that Amy's attention inflates Cain's ego and he thinks 'aye, aye . It's still young but in his book, he's like, 'wahey, I've still got it'. However, when he learns she is sixteen, he feels incredibly stupid and embarrassed. Cain shows no guilt and orders her to keep her distance. Halfpenny said Amy is not fazed by Cain's attitude and uses the situation to make David jealous. In August 2011, Amy discovers she is pregnant and is left in a state of shock. With the storyline Halfpenny received her busiest filming schedules since she started filming. Halfpenny told What's on TV that it couldn't have come at a worse time because Amy is on her final chance with Val and Eric. Cain is unsympathetic, angry while Amy is scared. Hordley said Cain wants to keep it low key to get rid and then move on. He attempts to force her into an abortion and Amy agrees because she isn't very bright and thinks it will be the easier option. When she sees her ultrasound scan, Amy cannot go ahead with the abortion due to her own upbringing. Amy's left in a terrified frame of mind when Victoria tells her about Cain's violent past. As the storyline developed, it held the potential to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a good place and they think Amy's all happy. The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes gutted to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a dark place as she is too young to be coping with something like this. As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do something dangerous. Though, Amy has Victoria to fall back on and is described as her rock . Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives of a lot of people around Amy. At times he said the narrative is truly heart breaking and dangerous. I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy ... were going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more. On 11 October 2013, it was announced Halfpenny would be leaving Emmerdale. The actress said she had had an amazing experience with the show and added It's completely changed my life, as it's given me confidence and I'm coming out of it having learnt so much. I now feel ready to move on and play other characters, although playing Amy Wyatt has been more fun than I'd ever imagined. Following Halfpenny's departure from Casualty in January 2019, speculation began that she would reprise her role as Amy. However, Halfpenny stated that she would not be returning to Emmerdale, as she wanted to do other things with her career. On 21 January, Jess Less of Digital Spy confirmed the character of Amy would be returning to the show, but with Natalie Ann Jamieson in the role. Of her casting, Jamieson said I feel very lucky to be joining the cast of such a loved and respected show. I'm very grateful for this opportunity, and can't wait to find out what the future holds for Amy Halfpenny later gave her approval to Jamieson taking over her role. Amy's car breaks down outside the village and Andy Sugden Kelvin Fletcher stops to help. Amy claims she is pregnant but Andy knows she is lying and takes her to the local garage. While her car is being serviced, Amy checks into the B B where she meets Val and Eric and claims to be a trainee nurse to get a discount but tells Victoria that she is actually 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out without paying but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by working for them. The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B B's basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she will not come out until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B B and later fosters her. Amy starts working for Leyla and develops feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain and tries to make David jealous. When Alicia steals 500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek to thank him for his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her.

Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption.

When Kyle drops his toy, Amy picks it up and tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is studying childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy.

They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt. In September 2015, David informs Amy of Val's death and the funeral date, but Amy believes it would be too big a risk to return to the village. She passes her regards to Eric and the family. Amy now played by Natalie Ann Jamieson is found by Kerry and Jessie Dingle Sandra Marvin in Belfast, fighting off a scruffy man. Kerry initially thinks she is a prostitute, but a horrified Amy denies it, and says she works at a women's shelter, and the man she fought off was one of the women's husbands. When Kerry tells her that Kyle is living with Cain, Amy is horrified, but when Kerry begs her to come back to the village, she says she can't and flees. However, the next day, she leaves Ireland and secretly returns to Emmerdale, surprising her mother. Amy tells Kerry she will fight for Kyle. In 2011, Halfpenny was nominated in the category of Best Soap Newcomer at the TV Choice Awards. She was later nominated in the category of Best Newcomer at the Inside Soap Awards. She was later nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2012 National Television Awards. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said Amy's first scenes resembled the start of a teen horror movie. Inside Soap described Amy stating To survive in soapland you need attitude and Amy Wyatt isn't lacking in that department. Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail has criticised Amy for the amount of make up she wears. When Leyla accused her of thieving, Stephen said it couldn't have been her because she wears too much eye make up. She jibed she's lucky she can find one foot in front of the other. When Amy is unsure whether or not to undergo an abortion, Stephen jested her first decision should be whether to change her mascara Ive seen less fuel faced coal miners. Stephen opined that it was obvious David was heading for trouble with gratingly Geordie Amy. She said she had no sympathy for him because he knowingly walked into Amy's maelstrom of rampant teen hormones.

"Major General Ira Thomas Wyche 16 October 1887 8 July 1981 was a career officer in the United States Army who became Inspector General of the United States Army. A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, during World War I he served in the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front, and returned to the United States to train artillery students. He spent time teaching and attending various army schools from 19181942 including the United States Army Command and General Staff College and United States Army War College. In May 1942, he took command of the 79th Infantry Division. He led the division in the Normandy landings, and oversaw many of its battles until May 1945. After World War II ended, Wyche took command of VIII Corps. He would later serve on the Officer Interview Board and command III Corps and 1st Service Command. He served as Inspector General of the Army from January 1947 to September 1948, during which he investigated charges that John C. H. Lee misused enlisted men under his command in occupied Italy. Wyche retired from the army in September 1948, and moved to Pinehurst, North Carolina. Wyche was born on 16 October 1887, on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, the son of Lawrence Olin Wyche and his wife Lorena nee Howard. Lawrence was the pastor of the Methodist church on Ocracoke. Wyche attended the Quackenbush School in Laurinburg, North Carolina. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Wyche entered the Military Academy on 15 June 1907. He graduated on 13 June 1911, 68th in his class of 82. Upon graduating, he received a commission as second lieutenant in the 30th Infantry Division. His classmates included John P. Lucas, Frederick Gilbreath, Charles P. Hall, Joseph Cowles Mehaffey, John Homer, Paul W. Baade, and William Henry Harrison Morris Jr. Wyche served from September 1911 to February 1912 at Fort Mason, in California, before he was transferred to the Presidio of Monterey in California. He returned to Fort Mason from May to June. After leaving Fort Mason, he traveled to Fort William H. Seward in Alaska, where Wyche remained until July 1914. He later spent several months at the Plattsburgh Barracks in Plattsburgh, New York, before graduating from the Mounted Service School, and serving in Texas beginning in 1916 briefly with the Signal Corps , during which he was promoted to first lieutenant. In 1917, he married Mary Louise Dunn. They had a daughter, Elizabeth. He spent time at Fort Sam Houston, Leon Springs and Camp MacArthur in Texas, and Camp Upton in New York, until May 1917, during which he was appointed to captain. Upon joining the American Expeditionary Forces on 18 May 1917, Wyche was promoted to the temporary rank of major then lieutenant colonel. He embarked for France on 22 June 1917, and spent most of his time in the St. Die sector on the Western Front, before returning to the United States to help train gunners in early August. He took command of an artillery regiment at Camp Jackson, in South Carolina, from July 1918 to December 1918. After leaving Camp Jackson, Wyche traveled to Washington, D.C., to work with the Purchase, Storage, and Traffic Division of the War Department. He remained there until December 1919, when Wyche instructed students in artillery at Camp Taylor, in Kentucky. In 1920, he reverted to his substantive rank of captain, and taught at Camp Knox, in Kentucky, from June 1920 to June 1922. Being promoted to major while at Camp Knox, Wyche spent the next ten years instructing artillery students at Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Forts Leavenworth and Riley in Kansas. He also attended the United States Army Field Artillery School and United States Army Command and General Staff College, and at one point commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment. Wyche left Fort Riley in August 1933 to attend the United States Army War College. After graduating, he assumed command of the 1st Battalion of the 14th Field Artillery Regiment in 1934. While in command, he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel. He later commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment from September 1938 to June 1940, when he was promoted to colonel. He then was the chief of the training sector at the Office of the Chief of Field Artillery until April 1941 during which he became a brigadier general . At Camp Blanding in Florida, he was the commanding general of the 74th Field Artillery Brigade until March 1942. He took a course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, where, after graduating, he was temporarily promoted to major general on 17 April 1942. Wyche spent time at various military camps, including Camp Pickett in Virginia, Camp Blanding, the Tennessee Maneuver Area, the Desert Training Center, Camp Phillips in Kansas, and the South Boston Army Base. He was appointed the commander of the 79th Infantry Division of the XV Corps, on 15 June 1942. He oversaw the division's attacks at the Battle of Cherbourg, where it spearheaded the attack on Fort Deroulede, and fought in several other battles, including the fight for the Forest of Parroy. The division participated in Operation Flashpoint in 1945. While commanding the 79th Infantry Division, Wyche created a new program for funneling replacement troops into front line units. He felt that new recruits were not receiving enough training, and he created a divisional replacement pool. Each infantry regiment sent one officer and one noncommissioned officer to serve on the staff of the pool, which also included one officer and four enlisted men selected from the division at large. This pool repeated most of the checking that new men had received at the forward replacement battalions, including the zeroing of rifles. Additional pool camps were operated in the three regimental sections and another one was maintained in the special troops section. These camps gave new arrivals a chance to learn many lessons from experienced soldiers. The success of this 79th Division pool caused the 44th Infantry and 100th Infantry Divisions, as well as some of the other XV Corps units to adopt similar methods. According to U.S. Army G 2 intelligence the 361st Volksgrenadier Division released a report on 25 October 1944 that stated The 79th Division is said to have fought particularly well in Normandy and is considered as one of the best attack divisions of the U. S. Army. Well liked by his soldiers, Wyche was known as the Doughboy's General , and called 'Papa' Wyche by his soldiers, as a result of his daily inspections of the Division's camp. For his service, he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit. Wyche left command of the division on 20 May 1945, after which he commanded VIII Corps until December 1945, when he took command of III Corps, leaving in May 1946. He was later a member of the Press Integration Interview Board and Officer Interview Board. In May 1946, Wyche took command of the 1st Service Command, which he held until 30 January 1947. Wyche then became the Inspector General of the U. S. Army in January, receiving the permanent rank of major general. While inspector general, he investigated charges raised by newspaper columnist Robert Ruark against John C. H. Lee, that he misused enlisted men under his command in occupied Italy. Wyche exonerated Lee in a report he issued in October 1947. The 12,000 word report concluded that Ruark had presented a wholly false picture of conditions. He retired from the office and army service on 30 September 1948. After retiring from the army in 1948, Wyche moved to Pinehurst, North Carolina with his wife, Mary. He would live there until his death on 8 July 1981 at Moore General Hospital. Wyche is buried at the Fort Bragg Main Post Cemetery.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira%20T.%20Wyche
"Wynnea americana, commonly known as moose antlers or rabbit ears, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae. This uncommon inedible species is recognizable by its spoon shaped or rabbit ear shaped fruit bodies that may reach up to 13 cm 5.1 in tall. It has dark brown and warty outer surfaces, while the fertile spore bearing inner surface is orange to pinkish to reddish brown. The fruit bodies grow clustered together from large underground masses of compacted mycelia known as sclerotia. In eastern North America, where it is typically found growing in the soil underneath hardwood trees, it is found from New York to Michigan south to Mexico. The species has also been collected from Costa Rica, India, and Japan. Wynnea americana is distinguished from other species in the genus Wynnea by the pustules small bumps on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculuma lid that is opened when spores are to be released from the ascus. Wynnea americana was first described in 1905 by American mycologist Roland Thaxter. Thaxter found several clusters of fruit bodies in Burbank, Tennessee in 1888, and believed the fungus to be Wynnea macrotis, one of the first identified species of genus Wynnea. An 1896 visit to the same location as well as Cranberry, North Carolina yielded further specimens. This time, however, Thaxter noticed that the fruit bodies were not attached to humus, as expected, but rather to a large, irregularly lobed, brown, firm, tuber like body buried a few inches deep in the humus. Microscopic examination of this structure and other tissue of the fruit body convinced Thaxter the material was sufficiently different from known Wynnea species to justify the creation of a new species. Both the Tennessee and the North Carolina specimens were used as syntypes to describe the taxon the Tennessee specimen has since been designated the lectotype the name bearing type specimen . In 1946, French mycologist Marcelle Louise Fernande Le Gal determined that the ascus in W. americana was similar in structure to those species he placed in the suboperculate series. The common names for W. americana are moose antlers , or rabbit ears . The fruit bodies technically called apothecia of W. americana are erect and spoon or ear shaped, and may reach up to 13 cm 5.1 in tall by 6 cm 2.4 in wide with the edges usually rolled inward. The outside surface is dark brown, while the inner surfacethe spore bearing hymeniumis pinkish orange to dull purplish red or brown at maturity. The outer surface may develop wrinkles in maturity. The apothecia, which occur singly or in groups of up to about 25, arise from a short stalk. The stalk is variable in length and solid, dark outside, white within. The stalks originate from a sclerotium, a compact mass of hardened mycelium. The sclerotium has an almost gelatinous consistency with irregularly shaped lobes and internal chambers, and may reach a diameter of 4 to 6 cm 1.6 to 2.4 in . The sclerotium's function is thought to supply moisture and nutrients, or to serve as a resistant structure capable of sustaining the fungus through times of stress. W. macrotis is the only other species in the genus to bear a sclerotium. Wynnea americana has no discernible odor, and its taste is unknown. It has been described as inedible due to its toughness. With many cup fungi, microscopic analysis of the anatomy and structure of the apothecium is necessary for accurate identification of species, or to help distinguish between related species that have a similar external appearance. In W. americana, the ectal excipulum the outer layer of tissue comprising the apothecia is 125 m thick, and composed of dark angular to roughly spherical cells that are 4070 m in diameter. The angular cells form pyramidal warts on the outer surface. The medullary excipulum the inner fleshy layer of tissue underneath the ectal excipulum is almost gelatinous, composed of interwoven hyphae 10 m in diameter. Several structural components are involved in spore discharge in W. americana, such as the ascus, the operculum, the suboperculum. The spore bearing cells, the asci, are 330400 m long by 1620 m wide. The ascus has a thickened apical ring that is capped by a hinged operculum, a lid that is opened when spores are to be released from the ascus. The presence of the apical ring beneath the operculum and the slanted opening that results is a condition known as suboperculate , and is shared with Cookeina tricholoma and Phillipsia domingensis, also in the family Sarcoscyphaceae. The spores are scaphoid boat shaped , and have dimensions of 3538 by 1214 m. They are marked with prominent longitudinal grooves, and when mature, are apiculate ending abruptly in a short point . The spores typically contain several oil droplets. The paraphyses sterile cells interspersed among the asci are 89 m long and have internal partitions called septa. The structure of the septa has been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, which has revealed that W. americana has a single pore plugged by a fan shaped matrix an electron dense region with a torus shaped ring of translucent tissue wrapped around it. The pore plug resembles those found in the Sarcoscyphaceae species Sarcoscypha occidentalis and Phillipsia domingensis. The closely related Wynnea sparassoides, known in the vernacular as the stalked cauliflower fungus , has a fruit body resembling a yellow brown cauliflower atop a long brown stem. In comparison to W. americana, W. gigantea has apothecia that are smaller, more rounded at the tips, more numerous in a single specimen, and paler in color. Donald H. Pfister, in his 1979 monograph on the genus Wynnea, suggests that the pustulate appearance of the outer surface clearly distinguishes W. americana from the other species in the genus. The fruit bodies of Wynnea americana grow solitarily or in clusters on the ground in deciduous forests, and prefer moist, organic soils. In both Asia and North America, fruit bodies are most often produced during August and September. The single Central American collection, from Costa Rica, was made in early November. In North America, Wynnea americana has been collected from several locations, including Tennessee, New York, West Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It has also been collected in Costa Rica, India, Mexico, and Japan.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynnea%20americana
"Wyntoon is the name of a private estate in rural Siskiyou County, California, owned by the Hearst Corporation. Architects Willis Polk, Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan all designed structures for Wyntoon, beginning in 1899. The land, sited at two sharp bends in the McCloud River, was named by financial adviser Edward Clark for the local Native American tribe of the Wintun people. Beginning as a humble fishing resort, the land was improved by a series of people, notably San Francisco attorney Charles Stetson Wheeler, his client Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and her son William Randolph Hearst who disputed with his cousin over ownership. Prominent structures, noted for their architecture, have been built on the land, some lost to fire, while other multimillion dollar buildings were planned, but not built. Famous visitors to Wyntoon include Clark Gable, Charles Lindbergh, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and his son John F. Kennedy. The earliest known inhabitants of the area of Wyntoon were the Winnemem Wintu tribe of Native Americans, a subgroup of the Wintun people. In the 1880s, outdoorsman, guide, hunter and trapper Justin Hinckley Sisson came to the area and established a hotel, restaurant and tavern at the foot of Mount Shasta. He advocated for a railroad line to be extended northward from Redding to his location, and was successful. Construction of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Siskiyou Trail began in the mid 1880s, and Sisson bought 120 acres 49 ha in its path. The railroad was completed in 1887 and brought miners, hunters, fishermen, loggers, naturalists and tourists. With his wife, the former Miss Lydia Field, Sisson operated the inn, and he led various groups of hunters, geologists and mountain climbers. With profits from his successful business, Sisson acquired large parcels of land including the tract which would become Wyntoon. He established the town of Sisson surrounding his inn, and he built a fishing resort a half day's ride away on the McCloud River, at an elevation between 2,700 and 3,000 feet 820 and 910 m , some 16 miles 26 km distant. Popular with hunters and fishermen, it became known as Sisson's on the McCloud . Justin Sisson died in 1893. In 1924, the town of Sisson was renamed Mount Shasta, California. In 1899, Sisson's widow sold the McCloud River fishing resort site to Charles Stetson Wheeler, a wealthy attorney from San Francisco. This parcel lay in the Cascade Range of mountains, south by southeast of Mount Shasta. Wheeler called this holding the Wheeler Ranch, and he built a hunting lodge on the river at Horseshoe Bendits cornerstone was laid in 1899. The multi wing lodge, dramatic with its stone walls and slate roof, was designed by San Francisco architect Willis Polk, and included an 800 book library with room for hundreds of Native American baskets. Wheeler directed Polk to give the lodge a fish tower a high study with a view, and two windows which were aquariums containing local trout. A Latin inscription over the entrance indicated this room was a temple to fishing piscatoribus sacrum. Polk's design was pictured in July 1899 in The American Architect and Building News which described it as a California Mountain Home . Sir Banister Fletcher included the building in a list of Shingle Style architecture. The layout of the structure, a rambling group of masses , snaked through the trees, curving to follow the bend in the river, the curve creating a courtyard with a circular drive and a central fountain. The dining room enjoyed a three sided view of the river, and diners could take the air on a wraparound porch. The porch opened to the river in a flight of wooden steps leading down to an octagonal gazebo pierced and supported by a large tree, overhanging the tumbling waters. Massive fireplaces and heavy timbers gave the impression of a medieval estate interior. Polk's use of stone and wood on the exterior achieved a sense of compatibility with the land, celebrating the setting's primal beauty. The Wheeler family stayed at the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst asked if she could purchase the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99 year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her. Wheeler retained the part of Wheeler Ranch that was not leased to Hearst, including The Bend. In 1911, Wheeler invited Austro Hungarian artist and naturalist Edward Stuhl and his wife Rosie to live on the property they made extensive studies of plant and animal life in the area, and collected many hundreds of specimens. Stuhl, an avid mountain climber, published Wildflowers of Mount Shasta from his base at Wheeler Ranch. After Wheeler's death in 1923, Stuhl served as custodian of the ranch. William Randolph Hearst bought Wyntoon outright from its 99 year lease in 1929, and in 1934 bought all of Wheeler Ranch and The Bend, a combined total of 50,000 acres 20,000 ha . Phoebe Hearst, upon signing the 99 year lease, decided to build a very grand residence. She hired Bernard Maybeck to design one in the Gothic style of a Rhine River castle. The structure was mainly complete in 1902, and cost Hearst 100,000. Maybeck hired Julia Morgan to assist in the design. The castle's layout was fitted to the slope of the site, and to a semicircle of six tall conifers. Its footprint was 120 by 56 feet 37 by 17 m an underground cellar was 45 feet 14 m wide, 15 feet 4.6 m high, and ran the length of the building, containing stores and a central heating furnace supplying steam throughout the building. The central tower made of stone reached to a height of 75 feet 23 m . A plumbed room entered from the outside allowed fishermen and hunters to clean their catch and themselves. Six floors of sleeping rooms were contained in the central tower each bedroom entered from landings along the main spiral staircase carved of stone. The exterior of the tower was thick load bearing crowning wall topped with a steeply angled roof to hold the weight of snow, and to shed excess snow. Glazed Paris green tile from the Netherlands surfaced the roof, providing a misty color like the holes between the branches in the trees in the forest. Bluish gray basalt volcanic stone was quarried from local lava flows it supplied the strength of the massive walls. The living room, 80 by 36 feet 24 by 11 m , had at one end an alcove framing a stained glass window, a copy of the 13th century one in Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg, the reproduction fabricated in the Netherlands. The room's apex was 36 feet higha meeting of steeply angled wooden beams resting on 7 foot 2.1 m thick stone walls. A tall fireplace separated the alcove from the majority of the living room a large man could stand in its opening. Another fireplace warmed the other end of the living room. Tapestries hung from the stone walls to add a medieval appearance. Frederick Meyer made furniture for this room, and for all Wyntoon, in European vernacular style. Maybeck designed a dining hall much like the living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, 40 by 40 feet 12 by 12 m , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached to the top of the ground floor the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery. Phoebe Hearst also built other structures including The Gablesa storybook dwelling for overflow guestsand a Honeymoon Cottage . The castle was habitable in 1902, completely finished in 1904. It was featured in American Homes and Gardens in 1906, a three page spread the same space given the house in Architectural Review in 1904. The writer in Architectural Review criticized the quaint wooden carvings which gave the impression of pastry and perfume , but praised the most important aspects of the structure The dark height of the room, the unobstructed archways, the deep blues, reds and yellows of the cathedral window, to which time had given maturity, the tapestries, the little flicker of fire, and the roaring of the river outside and you satiated, tired and inspired by the day's trip among hazel, dogwood, great aged pines, rocks, cascades, great trunks of trees fallen years agoa disheveled harmonyhere you can reach all that is within you. Hearst summered at Wyntoon and raised her son's children there when he was not watching them. William Randolph Hearst and his wife Millicent produced five sons from 1904 to 1915each one spent summer months at Wyntoon with grandmother. The boys' father sent instructions about their upbringing, writing after the eldest boy George Randolph Hearst was nearly washed down the McCloud, that the boys needed a severe warning about the river . Hearst occasionally entertained her society friends and acquaintances at Wyntoon, bringing selected guests up north from the PanamaPacific International Exposition of 1915. At her death in 1919, she willed Wyntoon to her niece Anne Apperson Flint, along with a Cadillac car and 250,000. Flint moved in with her husband, Joseph Marshall Flint, M.D, a former Yale professor of surgery. During this time, architect Julia Morgan designed four structures which were built at Wyntoon a superintendent's residence and a separate servant's quarters in 1924, and in 1925, a stables building holding a caretaker's house erected near a Swiss Chalet which was built for higher status domestic staff. From his mother's will, William Randolph Hearst received the bulk of the family inheritance, including the 270,000 acre 110,000 ha ranch in San Simeon, the 900,000 acre 360,000 ha Babicora Ranch in Mexico, a fruit orchard in Butte County, and various mining and industrial stocks, the whole worth around 510 million dollars. Wyntoon, however, was given to his cousin Anne Apperson Flint in his mother's will, and Hearst was angered over this. He refused to return to Flint any of the art objects from Wyntoon that had been loaned to the Palace of Fine Arts for an exhibit. In 1925 after years of acrimonious negotiation, he bought Wyntoon from Flint for 198,000, but he remained forever embittered toward his cousin. In the winter of 19291930, Maybeck's Wyntoon masterpiece burned down, possibly from a kitchen fire. Time magazine reported Hearst's losses at 300,000 to 500,000, including portions of his art collection. In early 1930, Hearst contracted to have Morgan design an even larger castle as replacement. Morgan was already working for Hearst on Hearst Castle in San Simeon and nearly finished with The Hacienda near King City. Morgan collaborated with her early mentor and teacher Maybeck on plans for an eight story Bavarian Gothic style castle with two great towers and more minor turrets, some 61 bedrooms proposed for Wyntoon's largest building project. Hearst instructed Arthur Byne, his art agent based in Madrid, to find likely buildings he could purchase for their stonework, to give Wyntoon an ancient air. In December 1930, Byne discovered Santa Maria de Ovila, a 700 year old Cistercian monastery, and Hearst paid 97,000 for it. The monastery was taken apart and removed illegally, but the Spanish government was changing hands and was not effective in stopping Hearst's hired men. Some 10,000 stones were shipped to a warehouse in San Francisco at a total cost of about 1 million. Another old structure removed from Europe was proposed for Wyntoon the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory had been used by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities. In the spring of 1931, Morgan offered several designs for Hearst's consideration, all of them using the stones of the Spanish monastery on the ground floor, reinforced by steel girders to take the weight of the upper floors. Portions of the monastery were considered as a library, an armory , and a living room. The final proposal from Morgan included an indoor swimming pool constructed from the monastery's old church. The 150 foot 46 m long swimming pool featured changing rooms and lounges in the old side chapels, shallow water for wading in the apse, 11 foot 3.4 m deep water in the central plunge, and a diving board where the altar had been. In July 1931, as a steam shovel was making ready to level enough land to accommodate the great castle, Hearst put a stop to all his construction plans. The Great Depression had greatly diminished his income, and he could not pay for his 50 million project at Wyntoon while at the same time indulging his expansion at San Simeon. Abandoning the massive castle idea, Hearst instead asked Morgan to design a Bavarian Village with multiple half timbered buildings in the medieval style of Germany or Austria. Hearst sent Morgan to Europe to study suitable buildings she brought fine artist Doris Day with her to investigate architectural inscriptions and painting styles. In 1932, Morgan put together a master plan for Wyntoon. It described a group of guesthouses with romantic names such as Cinderella House, Fairy House and Bear House, arranged not in a cramped medieval style but symmetrically around a common green in the Beaux Arts style. These three story structures with steeply gabled roofs were completed in 1933. Swiss artisan Jules Suppo and his assistants carved much of the German Gothic decorations. Day painted fine inscriptions and exterior decorative patterns. Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany painted exterior murals depicting Russian and Germanic fairy tales such as those from the Brothers Grimm, but Pogany's versions were bright, humorous and cheerful, not dark and grim. Downstream of the Bavarian Village, Morgan's plan called for a selection of leisure activities. A swimming pool with a pool house was to be near tennis courts and a croquet lawn, and a dining hall called The Gables would be equipped to show films. Though San Simeon could house perhaps 30 to 50 guests, the expanded Wyntoon plan could accommodate 100 for a weekend. In 1934, Hearst bought all of Wheeler Ranch. Polk's structure The Bend was torn down except for one wing containing the master bedroom. This wing held the cornerstone engraved The Bend 1899 . The rest of the building was redesigned by Morgan in Gothic Revival style and rebuilt from 1935 to 1941 using many of its original stones. On January 1, 1935, photographer Peter Stackpole's images of Wyntoon were published in Life magazine, showing Hearst relaxing at Wyntoon with friends. Hearst's communications office at Wyntoon was shown in the photos it was built next to Bear House to keep him abreast of current events. This office was fitted into a shingle covered bungalow built to house Joe Willicombe, Hearst's private secretary. The structure served as the nerve center of Hearst's publishing empire, with three round the clock operators minding the telegraph facilities and the telephone switchboard. In mid 1937, Hearst was forced by bankruptcy to sign over all of his holdings to a group of trustees called the Conservation Committee. Wyntoon was included, it was estimated the prior year to be worth 300,000. Headed by New York Judge Clarence J. Shearn, the trustees slashed Hearst's costs and halted the smaller side projects at San Simeon and Wyntoon which had kept so many contractors busy. Wyntoon was maintained only by a skeleton staff paid for by the Hearst Corporation. Hearst never hosted more than 14 guests at Wyntoon after the bankruptcy. From 1938 to 1940, Hearst's art collections were cataloged and sold, including items from Wyntoon. Hearst was made to pay rent out of his allowance when he stayed at any of his properties. After the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, blackout conditions were imposed on San Simeon because of its nearness to the ocean and associated likelihood of Japanese shelling, so before Christmas Hearst moved to Wyntoon with his lover, actress Marion Davies. There, the two lived in Bear House at the river's edge with their pet dachshunds. Davies' cherished dachshund named Gandhi, 15 years old, fell gravely ill during this time a veterinarian was called and the animal put down by injection. Distraught, Davies raged through Bear House, later writing I broke everything I could lay my hands on. Hearst's favorite dog Helen died in his arms at Wyntoon he buried her on a hillside covered with flowers, the spot marked by a stone inscribed, Here lies dearest Helen my devoted friend. And the water runs down to the spring, And the spring in a turbulent fountain, With a song of youth to sing, Runs down to the riotous river, And the river flows to the sea, And the water again Goes back in rain To the hills where it used to be. And I wonder if life's deep mystery Isn't much like the rain and snow Returning through all eternity William Randolph Hearst During the Wyntoon residency of Hearst and Davies, they received fewer visitors than they had at San Simeon, because it was more remote. They spent much time together, and Davies picked up sewing again after years of no practice. She sewed silk fabric into ties for Hearst. He wrote her a poem or a short note every night, which he slipped under her door for her to see in the morning. Over the 19431944 winter, with snow and ice transforming the outdoor scenery, Wyntoon hosted actor Clark Gable, film directors Louis B. Mayer and Raoul Walsh, columnist Louella Parsons, cartoonist Jimmy Swinnerton and his wife, aviator Charles Lindbergh and his family, the former president's daughter Anna Roosevelt and her husband John Boettiger who worked for Hearst , and millionaire industrialist Joe Kennedy who brought his 26 year old son Jack , the future president. Jack surprised Hearst by swimming in the freezing McCloud. Hearst's trustees reorganized the Hearst Corporation in 1943, installing Richard E. Berlin as president. Under Berlin, Wyntoon was made to turn a profitthe old 50,000 acre Wheeler Ranch holding and adjoining parcels adding up to 67,000 acres 27,000 ha were logged and replanted with more tree seedlings, the operation generating about 2 million annually by 1959. In the late 1980s, architects Blunk Demattei Associates BDA began working with the Hearst Corporation to complete the interior of Angel House whose construction had been halted in the late 1930s. BDA next began to remodel the one original bedroom wing of Polk's The Bend . There, the second and main bedroom wing finished in the 1950s in Tudor style burned down on December 30, 1992, and BDA was contracted to rebuild it. Sensitive to the problem of recreating the ambiance, BDA used Sugar Pine paneling in keeping with other rooms on site, wrought iron from Poland and from local blacksmiths, stones quarried locally, and Renaissance era fireplaces.

"USS Wyoming BB 32 was the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships and was the third ship of the United States Navy named Wyoming, although she was only the second named in honor of the 44th state. Wyoming was laid down at the William Cramp Sons in Philadelphia in February 1910, was launched in May 1911, and was completed in September 1912. She was armed with a main battery of twelve 12 inch 305 mm guns and capable of a top speed of 20.5 kn 38.0 km h 23.6 mph . During the First World War, she was part of the Battleship Division Nine, which was attached to the British Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. During the war, she was primarily tasked with patrolling in the North Sea and escorting convoys to Norway. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets throughout the 1920s, and in 19311932, she was converted into a training ship according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Wyoming served as a training ship throughout the 1930s, and in November 1941, she became a gunnery ship. She operated primarily in the Chesapeake Bay area, which earned her the nickname Chesapeake Raider . In this capacity, she trained some 35,000 gunners for the hugely expanded US Navy during World War II. She continued in this duty until 1947, when she was decommissioned on 1 August and subsequently sold for scrap she was broken up in New York starting in December 1947. Wyoming was 562 ft 171 m long overall and had a beam of 93 ft 3 in 28 m and a draft of 28 ft 6 in 9 m . She displaced 26,000 long tons 26,417 t as designed and up to 27,243 long tons 27,680 t at full combat load. The ship was powered by four shaft Parsons steam turbines and twelve coal fired Babcock Wilcox boilers rated at 28,000 shp 21,000 kW , generating a top speed of 20.5 kn 38.0 km h 23.6 mph . The ship had a cruising range of 8,000 nmi 15,000 km 9,200 mi at a speed of 10 kn 19 km h 12 mph . The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 12 inch 50 caliber Mark 7 guns in six Mark 9 twin gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in two superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of twenty one 5 inch 127 mm 51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. The main armored belt was 11 in 279 mm thick, while the gun turrets had 12 in 305 mm thick faces. The conning tower had 11.5 in 292 mm thick sides. In 1925, Wyoming was modernized in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Her displacement increased significantly, to 26,066 long tons 26,484 t standard and 30,610 long tons 31,100 t full load. Her beam was widened to 106 ft 32 m , primarily from the installation of anti torpedo bulges, and draft increased to 29 ft 11.75 in 9 m . Her twelve coal fired boilers were replaced with four White Forster oil fired boilers that had been intended for the ships cancelled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty performance remained the same as the older boilers. The ship's deck armor was strengthened by the addition of 3.5 in 89 mm of armor to the second deck between the end barbettes, plus 1.75 in 44 mm of armor on the third deck on the bow and stern. The deck armor over the engines and boilers was increased by 0.75 in 19 mm and 1.25 in 32 mm , respectively. Five of the 5 inch guns were removed and eight 3 inch 76 mm 50 caliber anti aircraft guns were installed. The mainmast was removed to provide space for an aircraft catapult mounted on the Number 3 turret amidships. Wyoming was laid down at the William Cramp Sons shipyard in Philadelphia on 9 February 1910, and was launched on 25 May 1911. She was completed a year and four months later, on 25 September 1912. After her commissioning, the final fitting out work was completed at the New York Navy Yard over the next three months. She then proceeded to join the rest of the fleet at Hampton Roads on 30 December, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Wyoming left Hampton Roads on 6 January 1913, bound for the Caribbean. She visited the Panama Canal, which was nearing completion, and then participated in fleet exercises off Cuba. The ship was back in port in Chesapeake Bay on 4 March. Wyoming then took part in gunnery drills off the Virginia Capes, and on 18 April, entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard for some repairs, which lasted until 7 May. She joined the rest of the fleet for maneuvers off Block Island that lasted from 724 May. During the maneuvers, the ship's machinery proved troublesome, which necessitated repairs at Newport from 919 May. At the end of the month, she was in New York harbor, to participate in the ceremonies for the dedication of the monument to the armored cruiser Maine, which had been destroyed in Havana harbor on 15 February 1898. On 4 June, Wyoming steamed to Annapolis, where she took on a crew of naval cadets from the Naval Academy for a summer midshipman cruise. After returning the cadets to Annapolis on 2425 August, Wyoming took part in gunnery and torpedo training over the next few weeks. On 16 September, she returned to New York for repairs, which lasted until 2 October. She then ran fullpower sea trials before proceeding to the Virginia Capes, where she participated in another round of fleet maneuvers. Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914. On the 6th, Wyoming left for Hampton Roads, where she took on coal in preparation for the annual fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean. The exercises lasted from 26 January to 15 March, and the fleet was based in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Wyoming and the rest of the fleet then proceeded to Tangier Sound for additional training, including gunnery drills. On 3 April, Wyoming left the fleet for an overhaul in New York, which lasted until 9 May. She then returned to Hampton Roads, where she took on a contingent of troops and ferried them to Veracruz, arriving on 18 May. The US had intervened in the Mexican Revolution and occupied Veracruz to safeguard American citizens there. Wyoming cruised off Veracruz into the Autumn of 1914, at which point she returned to the Virginia Capes for exercises. On 6 October, she entered New York for repairs this work lasted until 17 January 1915. Wyoming then proceeded to Hampton Roads, and then to Cuba, where she joined the fleet for the annual maneuvers off Cuba. These lasted until April, when she returned to the US. She participated in more exercises off Block Island over the next several months, and on 20 December, she returned to New York for another overhaul. On 6 January 1916, she emerged from dry dock, and then proceeded to the Caribbean. On 16 January, she reached Culebra, Puerto Rico, then visited Port au Prince, Haiti on 27 January. She entered port at Guantanamo the next day, and took part in fleet maneuvers until 10 April, after which she returned to New York. Another round of dockyard work took place from 16 April to 26 June. After returning to service, Wyoming took part in more maneuvers off the Virginia Capes for the remainder of the year. She left New York on 9 January 1917, bound for Cuban waters for exercises that lasted through mid March. She left Cuba on 27 March, and was cruising off Yorktown, Virginia when the US declared war on Germany on 6 April, formally entering World War I. Wyoming operated out of the Chesapeake Bay area for the next seven months, training engine room personnel for the expanding American fleet. On 25 November, Battleship Division 9 BatDiv 9 , which at that time comprised Wyoming, New York, Delaware, and Florida, departed the US, bound for Britain. BatDiv 9 was to reinforce the British Grand Fleet at its base in Scapa Flow. The American ships reached Scapa on 7 December, where they became the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. The American ships drilled with their British counterparts from December 1917 to February 1918. On 6 February, Wyoming and the other American battleships undertook their first wartime operation, to escort a convoy to Stavanger, Norway, in company with eight British destroyers. On 7 February, lookouts on several ships, including Wyoming, thought they spotted German U boats attacking the ships with torpedoes, though these proved to be incorrect reports. The convoy successfully reached Norway two days later the return trip to Scapa Flow took another two days. Wyoming patrolled in the North Sea for the next several months, watching for a sortie by the German High Seas Fleet. On 30 June, Wyoming and the rest of the 6th Battle Squadron covered a minelaying operation in the North Sea the operation lasted until 2 July. During the operation, jumpy crewmen again incorrect reported U boat sightings, and Wyoming opened fire on the supposed targets. On the return voyage, the 6th Battle Squadron joined up with Convoy HZ40, which was returning from Norway. On 14 October, New York collided with a U boat and sank it. The collision nevertheless damaged her screws, which forced Rodman to transfer his flag from New York to Wyoming while the former was in dock for repair. On 21 November, after the Armistice with Germany ended the war, Wyoming and an Allied fleet of some 370 warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea and escorted it into internment in Scapa Flow. On 12 December, Wyoming, now the flagship of Rear Admiral William Sims, the new BatDiv 9 commander, left Britain for France. There, she rendezvoused off Brest, France, with George Washington, which was carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the peace negotiations in Paris. Wyoming then returned to Britain two days later before departing for the US, arriving in New York on 25 December. She remained there through the new year, and on 18 January 1919, she became the flagship of BatDiv 7, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Robert Coontz. On 1 February, Wyoming steamed out of New York to join the annual fleet maneuvers off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port to help guide a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, Wyoming entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5 inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, Wyoming and the rest of the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August. On 9 August, Wyoming moved to San Pedro, where she was based for the next month. She went to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted until 19 April 1920. On 4 May, she was back in San Pedro and resumed her normal routine of fleet maneuvers off the California coast. On 30 August, Wyoming left California for Hawaii, where she participated in more training exercises through September. She then returned to San Diego on 8 October for more maneuvers off the west coast. The ship left San Francisco on 5 January 1921 for a cruise to Central and South American waters the trip culminated in Valparaiso, Chile, where she was reviewed by the President of Chile Arturo Alessandri Palma on 8 February. Wyoming then returned north, arriving in Puget Sound for repairs on 18 March. On 2 August, Wyoming was in Balboa in the Canal Zone, where she picked up Rear Admiral Rodman and a commission traveling from Peru back to New York. She arrived in New York on 19 August and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. There, she became the flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Wyoming spent the next three and a half years on the normal routine of winter fleet exercises off Cuba, followed by summer maneuvers off the east coast of the US. Throughout the period, she served as the flagship of Vice Admirals John McDonald, Newton McCully, and Josiah McKean in the Scouting Fleet. In the summer of 1924, she conducted a midshipman training cruise to Europe, and stopped in Torbay, Great Britain, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Gibraltar, and the Azores. In January and February 1924, the Navy conducted Fleet Problem II, III, and IV concurrently. During the FP III maneuvers, Wyoming, her sister Arkansas, and the two Florida class battleships stood in for the new Colorado class battleships. During the FP IV portion of the maneuvers, Wyoming served in the Blue force, which represented the US Navy. She was attacked by Black aircraft, but the umpires judged Wyoming's anti aircraft fire and the escort fighters provided by Langley to have effectively defended the fleet. On 14 February 1925, Wyoming again passed through the Panama Canal to return to the Pacific. There, she joined fleet exercises off California. She then proceeded to Hawaii, where she remained from late April to early June. She visited San Diego on 1822 June, and then returned to the east coast via the Panama Canal, arriving in New York on 17 July. A cruise to Cuba and Haiti followed, after which Wyoming returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 23 November to 26 January 1926. During this period, then Commander William F. Halsey, Jr. came aboard as the ship's executive officer he served on Wyoming until 4 January 1927. Wyoming then returned to the routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean and training cruises in the summer. In late August, the ship went to Philadelphia for an extensive modernization. Her old coal fired boilers were replaced with new oil fired models and anti torpedo bulges were added to improve her resistance to underwater damage. The work was completed by 2 November, after which Wyoming conducted a shakedown cruise to Cuba and the Virgin Islands. She was back in Philadelphia on 7 December, and two days later, she returned to her post as the flagship of the Scouting Fleet, flying the flag of Vice Admiral Ashley Robertson. Wyoming spent the next three years in the Scouting Fleet. She conducted training cruises with Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps NROTC cadets from various universities, including Yale, Harvard, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern. These cruises went throughout the Atlantic, including to the Gulf of Mexico, to the Azores, and to Nova Scotia. While on one of these cruises in November 1928, Wyoming picked up eight survivors from the wrecked steamship SS Vestris she took them to Norfolk on 16 November. On 19 September 1930, Wyoming was transferred from the Scouting Force to BatDiv 2, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Wat T. Cluverius. She served here until 4 November, when she was withdrawn from front line service and became the flagship of the Training Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Harley H. Christy. Thereafter, she conducted a training cruise to the Gulf of Mexico. After returning to Philadelphia on 1 January 1931, Wyoming was placed on reduced commission. Under the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed the previous year, Wyoming was to be demilitarized. During the demilitarization process, her anti torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. She was back in service by May, and on the 29th, she took on a crew of midshipmen from Annapolis for a training cruise to Europe, which began on 5 June. While en route on 15 June, Wyoming rescued the disabled submarine O 12 and took it under tow to Queenstown, Northern Ireland. While in Europe, she stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, Greenock, Scotland, Cadiz, Spain, and Gibraltar. The ship was back in Hampton Roads on 13 August while on the cruise, Wyoming was reclassified as AG 17 , to reflect her new role as a training ship. Wyoming spent the next four years conducting training cruises for midshipmen and NROTC cadets to various destinations, including European ports, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. On 18 January 1935, she carried the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, from Norfolk to Puerto Rico for amphibious assault exercises. On 5 January 1937, the ship left Norfolk and steamed to the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She took part in more amphibious assault exercises and gunnery drills at San Clemente Island. On 18 February, during the exercises, a 5 inch shrapnel shell exploded as it was being loaded into one of her guns. The blast killed six Marines and wounded another eleven. Wyoming immediately steamed to San Pedro and transferred the wounded Marines to the hospital ship Relief. On 3 March, Wyoming left Los Angeles, bound for the Atlantic. She reached Norfolk on 23 March, where she served as the temporary flagship for Rear Admiral Wilson Brown, the commander of the Training Squadron, from 15 April to 3 June. On 4 June, she left port to conduct a goodwill cruise to Kiel, Germany, arriving on 21 June. There, she visited Admiral Graf Spee. She left Germany on 29 June, stopping in Torbay, Britain, and Funchal, Madeira, and arrived in Norfolk on 3 August. Wyoming resumed her training ship duties for Naval and Merchant Marine Reserve units. She returned to Norfolk Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 16 October to 14 January 1938. Wyoming performed her typical routine of training cruises in the Atlantic through 1941. The cruises included another European trip in 1938 she took the midshipmen to Le Havre, France, Copenhagen, and Portsmouth. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, Wyoming was assigned to a naval reserve force in the Atlantic, alongside the battleships New York, Arkansas, and Texas and the aircraft carrier Ranger. Wyoming became the flagship of Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, the commander of the Training, Patrol Force on 2 January 1941. In November, Wyoming became a gunnery training ship. Her first cruise in this new role began on 25 November she was cruising off Platt's Bank when she received word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December. Following the United States' entrance into World War II, Wyoming performed her normal duties as a gunnery training ship with the Operational Training Command, United States Atlantic Fleet starting in February 1942. She operated primarily in the Chesapeake Bay area, and frequent sightings of the ship steaming around the bay earned her the nickname Chesapeake Raider . Wyoming was very busy, training thousands of anti aircraft gunners on weapons ranging from light .50 caliber 12.7 mm guns to medium caliber 5 inch guns for the rapidly expanding American fleet. Early in the war, the Navy briefly considered converting Wyoming back to her battleship configuration, but decided against the plan. These duties continued throughout the rest of the war. Wyoming was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944 the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12 inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5 inch 38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed these modifications allowed Wyoming to train anti aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. She was back in service in the Chesapeake Bay by 10 April. Over the course of the war, Wyoming trained an estimated 35,000 gunners on seven different types of guns 5 inch, 3 inch, 1.1 inch, 40 millimeter, 20 millimeter, .50 caliber, and .30 caliber 7.62 mm weapons. Due to her extensive use as a gunnery training ship, she claimed the distinction of firing more ammunition than any other ship in the fleet during the war. Wyoming finished her gunnery training duties in the Chesapeake area on 30 June 1945, when she left Norfolk for the New York Navy Yard, for further modifications. Work was completed by 13 July, after which she left for Casco Bay. There, she joined Composite Task Force 69 CTF 69 , under command of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee. Wyoming was tasked with developing tactics to more effectively engage the Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft. The gunners conducted experimental gunnery drills with towed sleeves, drone aircraft, and radio controlled targets. On 31 August, CTF 69 was renamed Operational Development Force, United States Fleet. Wyoming continued in this unit through the end of the war, and began to be used to test new fire control equipment. In the summer of 1946, then Ensign Jimmy Carter, the future President of the United States, came aboard as part of the final crew of the old battleship. On 11 July 1947, Wyoming put into Norfolk and was decommissioned there on 1 August. Her crew was transferred to the ex battleship Mississippi AG 128 , which was also serving in the gunnery training unit. Wyoming was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 16 September, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 October. She arrived on 5 December in New York, where she was dismantled by Lipsett, Incorporated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%20Wyoming%20%28BB-32%29
"The Wyoming class was a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy. The Wyoming and Arkansas were authorized in early 1909, and were built between 1910 and 1912. These were the fourth dreadnought design of the US Navy, but only an incremental improvement over the preceding Florida class, and the last US battleships to use 12 guns. The primary changes were the addition of a sixth twin gun turret, and improved armor protection, including the first use of a torpedo bulkhead on American battleships. The Navy considered using more powerful 14 inch 356 mm guns, but this would have caused delays and required larger ships. The two ships frequently served together, first in the Atlantic Fleet in the 1910s. Both vessels were deployed to British waters after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 to reinforce the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet. They served in the Pacific Fleet in 191921, before both returned to the Atlantic Fleet. Much of their time in the Atlantic Fleet was spent conducting peacetime training exercises, along with taking midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on training cruises. Wyoming and Arkansas were heavily modernized in the mid 1920s, receiving more efficient oil fired boilers to replace their old coal fired models, thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire, anti torpedo bulges to increase their resistance to underwater damage, and anti aircraft guns to defend against aerial attacks. The London Naval Treaty of 1930 mandated that Wyoming be demilitarized she accordingly was converted into a training ship, with half of her main battery turrets, belt armor, and anti torpedo bulges removed. However, Arkansas was permitted to continue in service with the fleet. After the United States entered World War II, Arkansas was used to escort convoys to North Africa. By 1944, she served as a coastal bombardment vessel in this role, she supported Allied landings at Normandy Operation Overlord and southern France Operation Dragoon before being transferred to the Pacific, where she provided fire support to Marines fighting on Iwo Jima and at Okinawa in 1945. Wyoming meanwhile continued as a training ship, being modified further in 1944 to include the various types of anti aircraft guns that trainees would operate in the fleet. Both ships were decommissioned shortly after the war, with Arkansas being expended as a target ship during the 1946 nuclear tests at Operation Crossroads, and Wyoming being sold for scrap in 1947. On 22 July 1908, the Newport Conference was held this included the General Board, the staff of the Naval War College, President Theodore Rooseveltwho had a keen interest in naval mattersand other officers. This conference examined a series of issues relating to existing battleships and new designs the first of these new ships would become the Wyoming class. The Board on Construction received general instructions from the Newport Conference those at the conference favored adopting the 14 inch gun, as the British Royal Navy had already traded their 12 inch guns for 13.5 inch 343 mm pieces. The Bureau of Ordnance BuOrd estimated that design work on the new gun, production, and testing would take two years. On 26 August, the Secretary of the Navy, Victor Metcalf, issued a request for eight and ten gun battleships armed with the 14 inch weapons to the Bureau of Construction and Repair C R . Speed was to be at least 20 kn 37 km h 23 mph , with as much armor as could be accommodated. BuOrd argued that at likely battle ranges, 8,000 to 8,500 yd 7,300 to 7,800 m , the 12 inch gun was powerful enough to penetrate existing armor, and so the 14 inch gun was unnecessary. C R produced three designs to meet Metcalf's request, all based on the preceding Florida design the first, referred to as design 404, was a battleship armed with eight 14 inch guns. The second, design 502, had an additional twin turret for a total of ten 14 inch guns. The third, design 601, would be fitted with twelve 12 inch guns. The General Board chose 601, since the design work for the 14 inch gun had not begun, and adopting it would have caused the class to be delayed. In addition, the ships' displacement would have increased more dramatically with the larger gun, requiring extensive improvements to harbor facilities design 502 would have only been able to dock in Pearl Harbor and Puget Sound with the existing facilities. The placement of the secondary battery also proved to be problematic. The cruise of the Great White Fleet in 190709 had demonstrated the problems with casemates on the main deck. They were too easily washed out in even moderate seas, making them unusable. Some officers at the Newport Conference had advocated placing them in the superstructure, but the heavy 5 inch 127 mm guns used by the Navy would have added excessive top weight. Another alternative was to place them in the forecastle, but the additional weight forward would have strained the ship where the forecastle stepped down to the main deck. The designers ultimately settled on a full length forecastle, which allowed the casemates to be moved about 4 ft 1.2 m higher in the hull. The ships' armor protection was improved over earlier designs. The belt and barbette armor was increased by an inch compared to an earlier version of the twelve gun battleship. A new protection scheme for the funnels was devised, after the Russian experience at the Battle of Tsushima three years before had highlighted the risk of a destroyed exhaust system. The designers also emphasized the need for improved underwater protection. As a result, the Wyomings design incorporated a torpedo bulkhead, the first time the feature was included on an American battleship design. Congress approved two new battleships, BB 32 and BB 33, on 3 March 1909. Design 502 later proved to be the basis for the subsequent class of battleships, the New Yorks. The ships of the Wyoming class were 554 ft 169 m long at the waterline and 562 ft 171 m long overall. They had a beam of 93 ft 3 in 28.42 m and a draft of 28 ft 7 in 9 m . The ships displaced 26,000 long tons 26,417 t as designed and up to 27,243 long tons 27,680 t at full combat load. They had a full length flush deck, which improved sea keeping and the ability to work the secondary guns in heavier seas. Both ships were fitted with lattice masts. Their transverse metacentric height was 5.4 ft 2 m They had a crew of 58 officers and 1,005 enlisted men. The ships were powered by four shaft Parsons steam turbines rated at 28,000 shp 21,000 kW . Steam was provided by twelve mixed oil and coal fired Babcock Wilcox boilers, which were trunked into two closely spaced funnels amidships. The engines generated a top speed of 20.5 kn 38.0 km h 23.6 mph , though on speed trials Arkansas made 21.22 knots 39.30 km h 24.42 mph from 25,546 shp 19,050 kW . Fuel capacity was 1,667 long tons 1,694 t of coal and 266 long tons 270 t of oil. This allowed the ships to cruise for 6,700 nmi 12,400 km 7,700 mi at a speed of 10 kn 19 km h 12 mph . At 20 kn 37 km h 23 mph , the range fell considerably, to 2,655 nmi 4,917 km 3,055 mi . Steering was controlled by a single rudder. The ships were armed with a main battery of twelve 12 inch 50 caliber Mark 7 Mod 0 guns in six Mark 9 twin gun turrets all on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in two superfiring pairs. These guns fired a 870 lb 395 kg shell with a 353 lb 160 kg propellant charge, which produced a muzzle velocity of 2,900 ft s 880 m s . Wyoming and Arkansas were the only ships of the US Navy to receive the gun earlier dreadnoughts were equipped with the lower velocity 12 inch 45 caliber Mark 5 gun. The Mark 7 had significantly better armor penetrating capabilities, owing to its higher muzzle velocity and thus higher striking velocity . At a range of 12,000 yd 11,000 m , the gun could penetrate 12.3 in 310 mm of contemporary face hardened armor, compared to 10.8 in 270 mm for the Mark 5. The guns were mounted in the Mark IX gun turret, which allowed for elevation to 15 degrees and depression to 5 degrees. Unlike the turrets used on earlier dreadnoughts, the Mark IX turret required the guns to return to 0 degrees to reload. The secondary battery consisted of twenty one 5 inch 51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. These guns fired a 50 lb 23 kg shell with a charge of 24.5 lb 11.1 kg , at a muzzle velocity of 3,150 ft s 960 m s . As was standard for capital ships of the period, they carried a pair of submerged 21 inch 530 mm torpedo tubes in the hull on the broadside. They were equipped with the Mark III Bliss Leavitt design, which carried a 218 lb 99 kg warhead and had a range of 4,000 yd 3,700 m at a speed of 26.5 kn 49.1 km h 30.5 mph . The main armored belt, which was 8 ft 2.4 m high, was 11 in 280 mm thick over the central portion of the ship, where it protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The belt reduced to 5 in 130 mm toward the stern. On the bottom edge it was reduced to 9 in 230 mm . The forward end of the belt was connected with an 11 in thick transverse bulkhead with the forward most main battery barbette, while the aft end of the belt was connected with a 9 in bulkhead. The main armored deck was 2.5 in 64 mm of special treatment steel, reduced to 1.5 in 38 mm in less critical areas. The conning tower had 11.5 in 292 mm thick sides and a 3 in 76 mm thick roof. The gun turrets had 12 in 305 mm thick faces and 3 in thick roofs. Their supporting barbettes had 11 in thick sides where they were exposed the portions that were masked by the armored belt were reduced to 4.5 in 110 mm . The lower half of the casemate armor was 11 in thick, and the upper half was reduced to 6.5 in 170 mm . Inboard of the casemate battery were longitudinal armored bulkheads these were designed to protect the uptakes to the funnels. These were deemed important because during the Russo Japanese War, three years before, Russian battleships had had their uptakes damaged, which ducted the boiler smoke into the ship rather than out through the funnels. Both ships were significantly modified throughout their careers. During and shortly after World War I, the horizontal armor of the ships was improved, including the roofs of the conning tower and the gun turrets. Their deck armor was increased to 3.5 in 89 mm , and eight 3 inch 76 mm 50 caliber anti aircraft guns were installed. Following the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in February 1922, modernization work was strictly controlled. The treaty governed what modifications could be made to existing ships, and included restrictions on what could be changed or added. Displacement could rise by no more than 3,000 long tons 3,000 t and no alterations of any kind could be made to the main battery guns or mounts. The primary areas that could be improved were those that concerned defense against aerial and underwater attack, along with propulsion systems. The two Wyomings, along with the Floridas and New Yorks were heavily modernized in the 1920s. All six ships were converted to completely oil fired boilers with equipment taken from the cancelled South Dakota class battleships. The boilers were trunked into a single funnel. These boilers were much more efficient than the coal fired models the ships had been completed with, and they allowed a significantly greater cruising radius of 11,000 nmi 20,000 km 13,000 mi . The ships were also fitted with anti torpedo bulges, which improved their underwater defense and also provided additional oil storage capacity. Wyoming and Arkansas lost their cage main mast, which was replaced by a short tripod mast that carried searchlights and radio antennas. Some of their secondary battery guns were relocated higher in the ship to improve their workability in heavy seas. A sponson for six guns was built into the hull abreast of the conning tower and the eight 3 inch anti aircraft guns were moved to the top of the sponson. Both ships had their torpedo tubes removed. Under the terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, Wyoming was to be demilitarized and converted into a training ship. During the demilitarization process, her anti torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. Wyoming was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944 the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12 inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5 inch 38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed these modifications allowed Wyoming to train anti aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. Modifications to Arkansas during World War II were kept to a minimum. In 1942, Arkansas received a new tripod foremast and bridgework, along with more anti aircraft guns throughout the war. By 1945, she carried nine quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounts and twenty eight 20 mm Oerlikons, and the number of 3 inch guns had been increased to ten. After entering service, both ships were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The ships took part in the normal routine of training and fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean, interspersed with periodic maintenance. Both ships toured the Mediterranean in late 1913, making stops in Italy and France, among others. In April 1914, Arkansas was involved in the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, and Wyoming arrived later to support the operation. Two men from Arkansas earned the Medal of Honor for their actions during the initial occupation of the city. After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Wyoming, along with the rest of Battleship Division 9 BatDiv 9 , steamed to Britain to reinforce the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, stationed in Scapa Flow. Arkansas initially remained in the United States, training gun crews for the expanding wartime fleet. In July 1918, she too was sent to Britain. Neither ship saw action during the war, though they were present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered in November 1918. From mid 1919 to mid 1921, Arkansas and Wyoming served in the Pacific Fleet, with the latter serving as the flagship of BatDiv 6. During this time, the ships made a tour of Central and South American countries, culminating in a visit to Valparaiso, where they took part in a naval review for the Chilean president. Both battleships returned in service with the Atlantic Fleet in mid 1921. They returned to their peacetime routine of training and maneuvers and periodic maintenance. In the summers, the ships would generally take midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on training cruises. In June 1925, Arkansas assisted relief efforts after the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. From late 1925 to late 1926, Arkansas received her reconstruction, followed by Wyoming in 1927. In 1929 and 1930, Arkansas visited European waters on midshipmen cruises she made stops in several countries. Wyoming was reduced to a training ship in 1931 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, and she spent the next decade conducting training cruises for midshipmen and NROTC cadets. From early 1932 to early 1934, Arkansas returned for another stint in the Pacific Fleet, followed by another tour of Europe later in the year. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was assigned to the reserve force for the Neutrality Patrols. She supported the occupation of Iceland in July 1941 as an escort for the troopship convoys. In November, as it became increasingly apparent that the United States would become involved in World War II, Wyoming was reassigned as a gunnery training ship, a role she served in for the duration of the war. Arkansas, meanwhile, continued in front line service during the war, first as an escort to convoys to North Africa, and then as a shore bombardment vessel. She supported the landings at Normandy in June 1944, shelling German positions at Omaha Beach, before bombarding Cherbourg later in the month. Her next bombardment mission came with Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, in August that year. She was then transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations for action against the Japanese. She bombarded Japanese positions on Iwo Jima in February 1945 and on Okinawa in April. With the end of the war in September 1945, Arkansas was employed with Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating American soldiers in the Pacific. Wyoming remained in service briefly after the war, though she was decommissioned in August 1947. She was sold for scrap in October and subsequently broken up. Arkansas was instead retained for use as a target ship during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in mid 1946. She survived the first test, an air burst code named ABLE, though the second experiment, an underwater detonation code named BAKER, sank the ship.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming-class%20battleship
"The Wytheville Raid or Toland's Raid July 18, 1863 was an attack by an undersized Union brigade on a Confederate town during the American Civil War. Union Colonel John Toland led a brigade of over 800 men against a Confederate force of about 130 soldiers and 120 civilians. The location of Wytheville, the county seat of Wythe County in southwestern Virginia, had strategic importance because of a nearby lead mine and the railroad that served it. This mine supplied lead for about one third of the Confederate Army's munitions, while the Virginia Tennessee Railroad transported Confederate troops and supplies plus telegraph wires along the railroad line were vital for communications. In addition to logistics of moving the lead to bullet manufacturing facilities, this rail line also connected an important salt works of an adjacent county with the wider Confederacy. Toland's entire brigade was mounted, and consisted of a mounted infantry regiment plus eight companies of cavalry. It approached the small town of Wytheville on the evening of July 18. The community had been warned that a large force of Union horsemen was heading in its direction, and hastily made preparations before the brigade's arrival. While many in the community fled south or hid in their homes, a force of about 120 civilians including home guard volunteered to defend their town. The Union cavalry entered the town first, charging in column down the main road that led into town. The men from the cavalry were ambushed by Confederate soldiers, Home Guard, and local citizens. Most of the local men, and women, fired their oneshot muskets from inside their homes and businesses. This type of warfare was considered unconventional at the time. One Union soldier described the road as an avenue of death . The Union force suffered significant losses. The Union commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, was left to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. Powell was also second in command of the entire brigade. Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, wounded, or missing. The Union after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expeditionalthough Confederate leadership believed the Union casualties were much higher. The entire expedition includes the trips to and from Wytheville. Approximately 300 horses were lost killed, wounded, or injured by the brigade during the raid and retreatincluding an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, the Union brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of the Union force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacya railroad line, telegraph line along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of the Union cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics. Wythe County is located in southwestern Virginia near the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was created in 1790, and named after George Wythe. Wythe was a legal mentor to Thomas Jefferson during the 1760s, and signed the Declaration of Independence. The crossroads town of Wytheville was the county seat during the Civil War, and remains so today. According to the 1860 census, the county's population was 12,305, and Wytheville's population was 1,111. Wytheville was said to have 1,800 inhabitants in 1863. Wythe County had two resources that caught the attention of the Union army during the Civil Wara lead mine and a railroad. The lead mine was located about 10 miles 16.1 km southeast of Wytheville in the unincorporated community of Austinville. The mine was the source for a significant portion, estimated to be about one third, of the lead used by the Confederacy to produce bullets for its armies. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which ran roughly eastwest through the county, served the lead mine. Telegraph lines strung along the railroad were vital for communications in the region, and enabled communications between the Confederate capitol of Richmond and points as far west as Tennessee. In addition, the railroad was important for transporting Confederate troops and supplies. The railroad had a station located about 0.75 mi 1.2 km south of the center of Wytheville. Ammunition and weapons for the Confederate Army were often stored there. Thus, the town had a strategic significance during the American Civil War, and was often a target. Because of the railroad, Wytheville was connected to two more points of military significance. A small headquarters for the Confederate army was located about 44 mi 70.8 km west of Wytheville at the western edge the adjacent Smyth County. The army outpost was at the community named Saltville, which was the home of a salt mine that was important to the Confederacy. Salt is essential for the diet of humans and livestock, and was also used at the time to preserve meat. Salt was not widely available during the Civil War, and eight states used salt from this mine. More fighting would occur at Saltville in 1864. About 25 mi 40.2 km east of Wytheville in Pulaski County is the Dublin railroad depot, which was a regional headquarters for the Confederate Army. The Dublin Depot was originally named Newbern Depot, although the town of Newbern is 2 mi 3.2 km south of the railroad line. A short time before the Civil War, the depot was renamed Dublin Depot in honor of the New Dublin Presbyterian Church, which was located nearby. Thus, some maps from the early 1860s still used New Bern to identify the depot. On the afternoon of July 13, 1863, a brigade of 870 Union soldiers departed their base camp located a few miles upriver east of Charleston, West Virginia. Their orders, which came from General Eliakim P. Scammon, were to disable the Virginia Tennessee Railroad. Telegraph line strung along the railroad line was also a target. If circumstances allowed, nearby lead and salt mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, and salt mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were in code. Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few. The Union brigade consisted of 365 men from the 2nd West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and 505 men from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. This combined force is considered undersized for a Civil War brigade, which usually consisted of about 2,600 soldiers. Colonel John T. Toland was the acting brigadier general, and therefore commanded the brigade. He was from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Toland had performed with utmost bravery and valor in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, which occurred during September 1862. During the campaign, Toland twice escaped serious injury while his horses were killed. The infantry commander was Lieutenant Colonel Freeman E. Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was also known as Piatt's Zouaves or the 1st Ohio Zouaves , and typically served as a mounted infantry, including in this expedition. As mounted infantry, Piatt's Zouaves used horses for transportation, but unlike cavalry fought dismounted. Their infantry weapons were heavier and had longer range than the light weapons used by cavalry. Colonel Abram S. Piatt, who retired in 1862 after injuries, was their original commander. Piatt's Zouaves wore distinctive caps and uniforms trimmed in red, but did not always have the Asian style baggy pants with open jackets typical of zouave units. Regiments that dressed as zouaves during the Civil War were copying the look and hopefully the discipline of elite French troops that fought successfully during the 1850s in northern Africa. Colonel William H. Powell was commander of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment, and second in command of the brigade. Powell also performed well in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, leading as a major the advance guard of the 2nd Loyal West Virginia Cavalry that successfully attacked a larger rebel cavalry and drove it away. If the rebel cavalry had not been removed from its position, the entire Union army in the Kanawha River Valley would have been surrounded and prevented from retreating to safety. During November 1862, Powell led a group of 22 men that captured an entire rebel camp in what became known as the Sinking Creek Raid. For this action, Powell was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Powell, who had been told by General George Crook to not return from the Sinking Creek Raid without good results, received a letter from Crook in 1889 that said ... I have always regarded the part you took in that expedition as one of the most daring, brilliant and successful of the whole war. After departing from camp, the brigade traveled along the Coal River, moving upriver about 50 mi 80.5 km without significant incidents. Traveling along the river required numerous river crossings. On the evening of July 14, the advance guard the cavalry's Company C was about 4 mi 6.4 km east of Raleigh Court House also known as Beckley, West Virginia when it was ambushed while crossing Piney Creek. A sergeant was killed, and a private mortally wounded. Three additional men were wounded. Colonel Toland sent forward two companies of infantry as skirmishers, which soon drove the Confederate force away. After the incident, the men were ordered to fall back to the pike that was located between the West Virginia communities of Raleigh Court House and Oceana. At the time, Oceana was the county seat of Wyoming County. The brigade became separated into two groups during this time early morning before sunrise on July 15 because the portion led by Lieutenant Colonel Franklin had not received the order to fall back. Both groups were required to operate on bad roads and in extreme darkness. They were reunited about 10 mi 16.1 km from Raleigh Court House around noon. At a farm 6 mi 9.7 km west of Raleigh Court House, a two company detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry joined the brigade and brought supplies. The detachment's leader, Captain George Washington Gilmore, also brought orders from General Scammon that clarified the brigade's mission. The men were issued four days of rations plus three days of rations for their horses. Any men or horses determined to be unfit to continue the expedition were sent back to their home camp with the empty supply wagons. The group returning to home camp was escorted by one company from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry. Thus, the brigade continued with 441 mounted infantry men, 298 men from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, and 79 men from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. The brigade passed Oceana Court House in Wyoming County on July 16. On the next day, the advance guard cavalry companies D, E, and F with Colonel Powell was sent forward to the top of Tug Ridge. Tug Ridge is located on the north side of Abb's Valley, near the Virginia border with West Virginia. During the war, Abb's Valley was an important mountain pass monitored by rebel troops. It was raining as Powell's men advanced, and they encountered a picket of six rebels who were inside a tent. A portion of the three companies led by Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson surprised the rebels, capturing them without firing a shot. About 3 mi 4.8 km beyond the ridge, near Abbs Valley, Powell and the three companies ... dashed into Camp Pemberton, at the head of Abb's Valley, and captured 25 prisoners belonging to a home guard company ... and 700 stand of arms, intended for arming a regiment in that vicinity. Food was also captured, and redistributed among the brigade. The weapons were destroyed. Up until this point, the brigade captured all rebels confronted in an effort to keep its location secret. However, one rebel in the Tug Ridge Abb's Valley region either was not captured or was captured and escapedand warned his superiors that a large Union force was approaching. A newspaper article about the raid, published a week later in Abingdon, Virginia, described the Union brigade while it was in Abb's Valley as having a Colonel along acting as a Brigadier, but mainly commanded by a one eyed Colonel by the name of Powell . On the evening of July 17, the brigade and its prisoners camped on a farm about 6 mi 9.7 km from Tazewell Court House Jeffersonville and 45 mi 72.4 km from Wytheville. On the morning of July 18, they passed Burk's Garden, and some houses and weapons were burned. At the foot of Walker Mountain, about 8 mi 12.9 km from Wytheville, the brigade's rear guard was attacked by Major Andrew Jackson May's cavalry of about 150 men. The rear guard at that time was Company C from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and it had also been assigned the task of guarding prisoners. The opposing forces had not expected a confrontation at this location, and May's force outnumbered the small group of surprised men from Ohio. May was able to free the rebel prisoners many were from the company that had been captured in Abb's Valley and capture Union soldiers. According to the report of Confederate General John S. Williams, Toland's brigade lost 8 men killed and 20 taken prisoner. About 5 mi 8.0 km outside of Wytheville, Colonel Toland sent two companies D and F of cavalry west to strike the Mount Airy railroad depot. The two company detachment was led by Captain George Millard. Its purpose was to destroy railroad infrastructure and telegraph lines on the west side of Wytheville, which would prevent Confederate troops located in the Saltville region from arriving by train and reinforcing Wytheville. It was determined that the target was too strongly guarded, so the two companies rode east to rejoin the brigade. They arrived in Wytheville near the end of the fighting. The main portion of Toland's brigade arrived in Wytheville around 6 00 p.m. on July 18. The rear of the brigade was still skirmishing with Major May's men at that time. After its successful clash with the rear guard, May's cavalry had pressed forward until it came upon the main body of Toland's men, about 3 mi 4.8 km from Wytheville. May was eventually forced to retreat to the mountains, since he was now outnumbered and had no advantage in the open terrain. After a small rebel skirmish line was discovered in front of the brigade near the entrance to the town, Colonel Powell and the cavalry were called forward from the rear. The Confederate Army became aware of the Union horsemen on July 17, after one man from the 45th Virginia Infantry escaped Toland's brigade near Tug Mountain. The rebel, who either evaded capture or was captured and escaped, fled on horseback and warned Confederate headquarters. Confederate General John S. Cerro Gordo Williams, headquartered in Saltville, Virginia, was notified of the invading Union Army at 11 00 am July 17 while he was visiting outposts in Tazewell County. The information was passed by couriers and telegraph, and Confederate military posts throughout the region became aware of a Union army force near Tazewell Court House that was estimated to be 1,300 men. By sunrise on July 18, Williams had a cavalry unit of 250 men report for duty. This cavalry unit, which had been retrieved from adjacent counties west of Saltville, was led by Major May and Major John D. Morris. Rebel scouts were now reporting the movements of the Union army. Major May's cavalry was sent to harass the Union force until a planned junction with Confederate infantry led by Colonel William E. Peters. In addition to the headquarters of General Williams, Saltville was the home of an important salt mine that provided salt for much of the Confederate nation. As the Union brigade moved in Tazewell County, the Confederate Army command became concerned about the salt works, which is located on the west side of Smyth County. For this reason, the infantry force led by Colonel Peters was moved back toward Saltvilleand Major May did not receive support. On the early afternoon of July 18, the situation changed the Union expedition was moving closer to Wytheville and the lead mine located in Wythe County, just south of Wytheville in Austinville, Virginia. The lead mine was a major source of lead for bullets used by the Confederate army. Ironically, the company that ran the mine was named Union Lead Mining Company. Lead was shipped on the Virginia Tennessee Railroad to Richmond, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, to be made into bullets for the Confederate Army. General Samuel Jones, commander of the Confederate Armies in southwest Virginia, was informed of the Union Army's movements beginning midday July 18. Jones' headquarters was at the Dublin railroad depoteast of Wytheville along the Virginia Tennessee Railroad. Jones intercepted a passenger train on the railroad line around 3 00 pm, and the train was used to haul soldiers and equipment to Wytheville. He sent two small newly organized companies, employees from his headquarters, and some local citizens who volunteered to help. This group totaled to about 130, and was led by Major Thomas M. Bowyer. Bowyer's men were well armed, and brought two pieces of artillery plus additional small weapons for the locals. The train carrying Bowyer and his men was delayed because it had to wait for an eastbound train to pass. The citizens of Wytheville eventually became aware of the invading Union Army. Local legend says that on July 17, a farmer in Tazewell County located north of Wytheville sent his daughter on a night ride to warn the town of Wytheville of the approaching Union horsemen. The young woman, Molly Tynes, rode 41 mi 66.0 km through mountain ranges and a forest to warn the small town. Joseph Kent, who was working on his farm east of the town, was summoned by the town leaders. Kent was a veteran of the MexicanAmerican War who had fought at the First Battle of Bull Run also known as First Manassas before resigning and returning home. Kent was called Major Joseph F. Kent in Bowyer's after action report. Because of his military experience, Kent was asked to lead the community's defense. He held a meeting at the courthouse, and sent volunteers to Walker Mountain to serve as lookouts. Many in the community panicked and fled south to the mountains not Walker Mountain . Valuables were removed from the banks and the post office, and also moved to the mountains south of town. The citizens that were willing to fight were asked to gather their weapons and reassemble at the courthouse. Bowyer and his men arrived at the train station south of Wytheville at 5 10 pm, when the Union brigade was about 1 mi 1.6 km north of town. The depot was about 0.75 miles 1.2 km south of the center of town. The artillery was unloaded from the train, but horses could not be found to move it. Bowyer, with assistance from Kent and Abraham Umbarger from the local militia, distributed his extra small arms to the local citizens. A small line of rebels had already formed on the north side of town. By 5 30, Bowyer's men began moving from the depot toward town. Bowyer wanted to bring all armed citizens to the railroad depot, where he believed he could use his artillery. Kent rejected that idea, believing they would have no chance against a quick strike from the horsemen. Kent moved his citizen volunteers into houses and buildings, while most of Bowyer's men stayed near the courthouse or at the south end of town. As the Union soldiers approached Wytheville in the early evening of July 18, the rear portion of the command was having small skirmishes with Confederate cavalry following them. About 1 mi 1.6 km outside of Wytheville, rebels were encountered in the front. This small group of rebels was positioned along the crest of a low ridge that obscured the view into town. Colonel Powell and the cavalry were ordered from the rear to the front to charge into town. Toland's order was for the charge to be made in columns down the town's main pike that was blocked by the small group of rebels. Colonel Powell requested that Colonel Toland have the infantry dismount and drive the rebel skirmishers toward town before the charge, because he was unable to see what was behind the rebels. Powell also suggested that if the cavalry were to charge, the men should be deployed to right and left instead of a straight ahead charge. Toland characteristically disregarded and strongly rejected Powell's suggestions. The cavalry obeyed Colonel Toland's order and charged forward in column, four abreast. The small group of rebels quickly fled into town with the Union cavalry following. The charge was led by Captain Gilmore's two company detachment from the First West Virginia Cavalry, followed by Colonel Powell and Company I of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry. A second group consisting of Company B and Company H from the 2nd West Virginia, led by Major John J. Hoffman, entered the town next. Company E served as the cavalry's rear guard. The riders expected a battle line with Confederate soldiers further down the street. Instead, they discovered that the road was lined with a high stake fence, and the houses on both sides of the road were full of armed citizens of the community. Private Joseph Sutton, a member of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry and participant in the raid, described the street that led into Wytheville as an avenue of death . As the Union cavalry approached, about half of the 120 local civilians fled south toward the railroad depot, and took positions closer to the men from the Confederate army. The initial volley fired by the remaining and nervous locals was ineffective because it had been fired too soon. The second volley, fired after a signal by Major Kent, found many in Captain Delaney's Company A. His group was fired upon by a company of Confederate soldiers in the street and from locals in the houses. One local, recalling this volley many years later, said The colonel commanding the raiding party was killed, and the head of the column went down, men and horses in a confused mass. He also said The momentum of the column of cavalry carried many who were near the front over the dead and wounded men and horses. It was death to them to remain or hesitate. They spurred their horses forward over their dead and dying comrades and passed between our ranks as we opened out to the sidewalks. While they dashed by us firing their pistols, we continued the use of the musket. The bugle sounded the retreat, and the column of cavalrymen faced about and retired, only to re form and come at us again. Major Kent's idea to fight from the cover of buildings was considered an irregular but most successful combat . Major Bowyer, leader of the Confederate force, said Owing to the great advantage we secured in fighting from houses and other shelter against mounted men in the streets, we were enabled to inflict far greater loss upon the enemy than we sustained ... Although the original shooters from the town's buildings were citizens and home guard, they were eventually joined by some of the soldiers from the Confederate army. A newspaper described the beginning as a desperate fight , with the locals in the houses shooting them down like sheep, and producing great consternation amongst them. The three Union cavalry companies leading the charge advanced into the town, but suffered casualties almost immediately. Captain Delaney of Company A of the 1st West Virginia Cavalry not a colonel was the leader of the charge. Delaney was one of the first officers killed. Both of Delaney's lieutenants were woundedone of them First Lieutenant William E. Guseman mortally. Leaders were definitely targets. Major Hoffman, leading the remaining portion of the cavalry, was thrown over his horse after it was shot. The horse was killed and the hard fall left Hoffman temporarily stunned. Although Hoffman was not killed, one newspaper report mentioned a major among the Union dead. Hoffman's portion of the cavalry, along with the many casualties from the first three companies, was effectively stoppedwith many of the men injured after being thrown from their horses, wounded, or killed. They were mostly caught in an open space and surrounded by a high fence and dead horsesand being shot by an enemy protected by the cover of buildings. One historian wrote that the trapped cavalry men were sitting ducks . Some of the men took cover behind dead horses while others fled back up the road. Approximately 80 horses lay dead in the street. Assuming the 80 horses all belonged to the cavalry, about one fifth of the cavalry became horseless. Of the 79 men in the detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, 26 were killed, missing, or wounded during the expedition. Most of those casualties occurred in Wytheville. Confederate General Sam Jones claimed that the Union force lost every one of their field officers. Despite the casualties of men and horses, portions of the first three companies began to work in earnest, flashing from one end of town to the other. A request was made for reinforcements from the infantry. The infantry had been held in reserve, but immediately dismounted and moved forward when the 2nd West Virginia sought safety . Lieutenant Colonel Franklin wisely brought his infantry forward on the sides of the streetdismounted as Powell preferred earlier . A company of infantry occupied one side of the pike that led into town. Portions of the trapped 2nd West Virginia, now dismounted, pushed down the fence and occupied the other side. These two groups moved forward as skirmishers to dislodge its enemy from houses and buildings. During the early part of the fighting, Colonel Powell was accidentally shot in the back from friendly fire. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, without its two highest ranking officers Powell and Hoffman , became disorganized. A portion of the cavalry was trapped in the open against shooters protected by buildings, and many dismounted either for their own safety or because their horse had been shot. At that time, Colonel Toland hurried forward to run the leaderless dismounted cavalry. Freeman and the infantry were already further south in town. The cavalry believed their behavior was appropriate for the situation, and advised Colonel Toland to act in a similar manner. Toland, still on his horse, became an easy target for shooters from a nearby two story brick house. Despite warnings from the cavalry's Company H that he should take cover, Toland refused to dismountsaying the bullet that can kill me has not been made . He was shot through the heart immediately after his exclamation. This happened early in the fighting, and men from the 2nd West Virginia's Company H were close enough to hear the bullet strike him. Thus, both colonels were eliminated from the fighting during the first 10 minutes. With Toland dead, the severelywounded Powell was in command of the brigadebut Powell was thought to be dying, and could not be moved. This left the infantry's Lieutenant Colonel Franklin in command, although he did not know this until the fighting was mostly over. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry did not reform and act as a regiment. It had only four companies in the town, and one was serving as the rear guard. Instead, individual companies were led by their captains or lieutenants , and some of these leaders performed well. Captain Gilmore led the portion of cavalry that was still mounted, including what was left of his two company detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. Gilmore's detachment, which suffered most severely , was complemented in the after action report made by Lieutenant Colonel Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, led by Franklin and Major John W. Shaw, also performed well. On the south side of town, a Confederate artillery crew led by Captain John M. Oliver struggled to find horses to move their two artillery pieces. Finally securing horses, they moved toward Main Street with their two large weapons. Captain Gilmore, from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, became aware of the artillery threat, while a small group of Confederate soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Henry Bozang rushed to protect the artillery and its crew. A combined force of cavalry and infantry, led by Lieutenant Abraham from Gillmore's Company, charged through Bozang's men while the artillery crew hurriedly tried to load their weapons. The Confederate artillerists were able to fire one shot, but its main effect was to cause the horses still attached to the other piece of artillery to panic and pull it over. Before the remaining artillery piece could be reloaded, Abraham's men captured it while killing Oliver and two gunners. The remaining artillery crew fled. Lieutenant Bozang was wounded and his command surrendered. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, with its superiority in weapons and size, soon drove back all resistance. They attacked the courthouse Major Bowyer's command post and surrounding buildings. After some very intense and close fighting, the Confederate soldiersunderstanding that they were vastly outnumbered, their artillery had been captured, and some of the buildings were on firewere ordered to withdraw from the town. They were to meet about 1 mi 1.6 km south of the railroad depot at the railroad water tank, where the train had been moved for safety. When they arrived at the rendezvous point, they discovered that the railroad conductor had panickedand left without them. They were forced to walk back to Dublin. Without the Confederate soldiers, the remaining fighters home guard and citizens of the town were vastly outnumbered by the invading force. Many of them dropped their weapons and fled south. The disorganized Union soldiers had trouble differentiating between innocent bystanders and fighters unless gunpowder marks on their clothing gave them away . Toland's acting Adjutant General, Lieutenant Ezra W. Clark, ordered more buildings burned. The Union soldiers began burning all buildings that had contained rebel marksmen and markswomen , and prisoners were taken. Around this time, Captain Millard's cavalry detachment arrived in Wytheville. He reported that the Mount Airy Depot was occupied by a strong Confederate Army force. It was close to 8 00 pm, and the fighting was over. The report of Lieutenant Colonel Freeman Franklin said that The loss of the enemy in killed was estimated at 75 the number of wounded unknown. We took 86 prisoners, besides 35 at Abb's Valley. Eight to ten houses were set on fire by the Union army. A small amount of damage was inflicted on the railroad line, but it was later repaired in less than an hour. Later in the evening, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin began planning the brigade's next move. After consulting with Colonel Powell and regimental commanders, he determined that a return to the safety of base camp was the best alternativeespecially without good intelligence on the strength of the enemy forces assumed to be moving toward Wytheville. The brigade left town less than 12 hours after it arrived. Franklin's brigade departed on the same road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse Jeffersonville . It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops under the command of Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville. Because of the difficult situation, the Union brigade paroled its prisoners, and continued its retreat north by obscure and winding mountain paths. Many horses gave out and were left on the mountain paths. Some of the worn animals fell to their deaths on the steep trails. The brigade was able to capture additional horses, so only about 100 men returned to home camp dismounted. The rear guard was attacked on July 19 and 20, but repulsed its pursuers. The Union brigade reached the safety of Union lines at Fayetteville on July 23, having received no rations for four days. Confederate Colonel McCausland believed that the retreating Union brigade should have been captured. His report said I am also of the opinion that the cavalry force that was in Tazewell, under General Williams and Colonel May, was sufficient to have captured the enemy, if it had been properly managed. Franklin's report said that Union losses for the entire excursion were 11 killed, 32 wounded, 17 taken prisoner, and 26 missing. This includes 2 officers killed, 5 wounded, and 1 missing. More men would eventually die from their wounds, including Lieutenant Guseman from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. The infantry's portion of the casualties was 4 killed, 11 wounded, 17 taken prisoner, and 10 missing. Captain Gilmore's two company cavalry detachment had the most severe losses about one third of the men were killed or wounded , especially Company A. Companies B and I from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had fatalities in Wytheville, while Company C lost two men early in the excursion in the ambush near Piney Creek. An estimated 300 horses died or were left to die. Infantry leaders were critical of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, and members of the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership. Despite the losses, Union General Scammon wrote an order saying The general commanding congratulates the troops of his command on the brilliant achievements ... The Confederate point of view for the battle was much different from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander Colonel Toland and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded. The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote ... there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure. Colonel Powell's wound to his back was judged to be fatal by surgeons for both the Union and Confederate armies. One historian believed that Powell also lost an eye in this battle, but his eye was permanently injured before the war. When the Union army departed from Wytheville, Powell was left behind with other wounded soldiers that could not be moved. These men became prisoners of the Confederacy. The citizens of Wytheville blamed Powell for the burning of many of the community's homes. General Jones wanted Powell held accountable for the burning of two buildings from an earlier raid, and added that Powell was ... one of the most dangerous officers we have had to contend with ... For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Several local women were instrumental in preventing retaliation on the blue coated prisoners. Powell unexpectedly healed, and was eventually moved to Richmond's Libby Prison where he survived for a portion of that time in a dungeon on a bread and water diet. He was exchanged for Colonel Richard H. Lee in early February 1864, and returned to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry during March 1864. Years after the fighting, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry's Captain Fortescue Company I , wrote ... though I was afterwards on many hotly contested fields, I was never upon any that was more so than Wytheville.

"X, sometimes referred to as Mr. X, is a fictional character on the American science fiction television series The X Files. He serves as an informant, leaking information to FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to aid their investigation of paranormal cases, dubbed X Files. The character serves as a replacement for Deep Throat, who had been killed off in the first season finale, The Erlenmeyer Flask . X himself would be killed off after appearing in several seasons, eventually being replaced by Marita Covarrubias. X is portrayed in the series by Steven Williams, and made his debut in the second season episode The Host , although the character would not appear on screen until Sleepless , two episodes later. The role had originally been conceived as female, with Natalija Nogulich cast in the role however, her initial scenes were deemed unsatisfactory by the producers, leading to her replacement. Williams' portrayal of X was intended to introduce a personality completely different from the character's predecessor, Deep Throat, and was positively received by critics and fans. The character of X was originally intended to be a woman, and Natalija Nogulich had been cast in the role. However, Nogulich was replaced by Steven Williams after shooting her first scene, as the writing staff felt Nogulich was not able to create the right chemistry with her co stars. Williams had previous experience with writers Glen Morgan and James Wong, although it was series creator Chris Carter who suggested him for the part. Williams' portrayal of the role was intended to act as a counterpoint to Jerry Hardin's portrayal of X's predecessor, Deep Throat. Whereas Deep Throat had been a selfless character, X was written and performed as a scared, selfish character. Prior to the episode One Breath , Glen Morgan had felt that the character of X was not going over too well with fans of the series, as he seemed to simply be a copy of Deep Throat. Believing Williams to be an actor worth having as a series regular, he included in the episode a scene in which X murders witnesses who have seen him speaking to Fox Mulder. Morgan felt that such a scene reflected X's paranoia and the difference between him and his predecessor, noting that Deep Throat was a guy willing to lose his life for letting out the secret, whereas X is a guy who's still scared . Williams has stated that he has never attempted to rationalize the character's motives or imagine a backstory for him, preferring to play the role with as little background as possible he once stated the less I know about him, the more interesting he becomes. Williams' background in fight choreography, stemming from his role in Missing in Action 2 The Beginning 1985 , allowed him to prepare for, and to help create, the character's action scenes, including choreographing the character's brawl with Mitch Pileggi's character Walter Skinner in the episode End Game . Williams has also stated that his portrayal of the role is based in part on Avery Brooks' character Hawk on the series Spenser For Hire. X was introduced on the series via a phone call made to Fox Mulder David Duchovny in the second season episode The Host , telling Mulder that he had a friend in the FBI . However, the character did not appear on screen until Sleepless , two episodes later, aiding Mulder in an investigation by leaking information on a secret military project from the Vietnam War. While X's loyalties and his own agenda were often unclear, he proved more than once that he at least does not want Mulder dead. In the episode End Game , he is approached by Dana Scully Gillian Anderson , who pleads that she needs to know where Mulder is, believing his life to be in danger. Initially X refuses, and is subsequently confronted by Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , who seemed to recognize X. He relinquishes Mulder's location, though not until after a brief but intense scuffle with Skinner. In the episode 731 , X's loyalty to Mulder is further confirmed. Trapped on a train car equipped with a time bomb, Mulder, about to escape, is attacked brutally by the Red Haired Man, a Men in Black assassin. X fatally shoots the Red Haired Man as he is about to step off the car, then boards the car with only enough time left to save either Mulder or the alien human hybrid the car was transporting. He opts to save Mulder, and carries him off to safety just as the car explodes. In the season 4 opener Herrenvolk , X's position as an informant is discovered by the Syndicate. When suspicion arises after the finding of photographs that were taken of The Smoking Man William B. Davis by X, false information is planted at the First Elder's behest, in order to root out the leak. Attempting to relay the information to Mulder, X goes to his apartment and is surprised by fellow Men in Black operative, the Gray Haired Man, who fatally shoots him. With his last strength, X crawls to Mulder's doorstep and writes in his own blood SRSG , meaning Special Representative to the Secretary General of the United Nations, and thus, this clue leads Mulder to Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden . After his death, X appears two more timesin The Lone Gunmen origin story Unusual Suspects, set before his death, and as a ghost in the season 9 finale, The Truth . The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen on the series' informants. The character of X has been well received by critics. Entertainment Weekly included the character in the list of the top 20 Black Sci Fi Icons in 2009, at number 17. Emily VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, has praised the gravitas of Williams' acting, adding that she wished that the writers had figured out a way to have him around more often than they did . VanDerWerff's fellow writer Zack Handlen felt that the character's assassination in Herrenvolk was appropriately shocking , calling the scene one of the most memorable death's in the series although he felt that the immediate introduction of the character's successor, Marita Covarrubias, deflates the importance of X's loss in the episode. Handlen has also called X the best of Mulder's informants , explaining that this is because he's always pissed off, he's always reluctant to provide information, and you can't ever be sure what play he's really running . Series writer Frank Spotnitz has called X the meanest, nastiest, most lethal killer on the planet . Steven Williams has noted that he feels the episodes Nisei and 731 were chiefly responsible for the character's popularity with fans. In 1997, Williams was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series for his work as X, alongside Gillian Anderson, William B. Davis, David Duchovny and Mitch Pileggi.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%20%28The%20X-Files%29

The season was presented by Luke Jacobz. Ronan Keating and Sebastian were the only judges from the previous season who returned, while Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Mel B joined the judging panel as replacements for former judges, Natalie Imbruglia and Kyle Sandilands.

On 16 March 2011, judge Kyle Sandilands announced on his breakfast radio show, Kyle Jackie O that he would not be returning to the judging panel for the third season. Of his decision, Sandilands said, Not because I didn't like it. I thought the show was great and it was great fun to do but it's just too hectic, it's too much work. So, I've told Channel Seven, no. On 31 March 2011, it was announced that Natalie Bassingthwaighte would join the judging panel as a replacement for Natalie Imbruglia. When speaking of her role as a judge, Bassingthwaighte said she would focus on bringing an honest critique to the show and would guide the artists through the competition .

She said, I don't care much for the other judges ... Ronan thinks he knows it all Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.' During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, I think it's in fun I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap. Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown. More controversy occurred after Sebastian took aim at contestant Mitchell Callaway's attitude to the competition following his performance of Run to Paradise on the third live performance show. Sebastian told Callaway You've got to have the right attitude to this competition, you've got to be focused and to be honest, not be rude to people and have the work ethic. For you to not learn your lyrics and for you to at times be rude to crew, you really have to pull that in and rein that in because you won't last long in this competition or this industry if you do that. The following morning, Callaway's mentor Bassingthwaighte spoke to radio station 2Day FM about the issue It makes me feel sick actually, I feel sick in the stomach ... I feel Mitchell did the best performance that he's done so far, I think Guy made the mistake of commenting on stuff that didn't happen on camera. He said he's rude to crew and needs to check his behaviour ... When he got off stage he said, 'I'm not coming back'. However, later that same day, Callaway tweeted, I'm not gunna quit guys ... It's not the Aussie way. I'm not gunna let al u beautiful ppl dwn. Or Natalie after everythyng she's done. On the third live results show, Sebastian apologised to Callaway and said he chose the wrong time and place to say it . The Seven Network insiders revealed that a clash between Callaway and another contestant, Declan Sykes, was the real reason behind Sebastian's on air rebuke. Sykes, who battles Asperger syndrome, reportedly took offence at being pricked with a pin by Callaway. Contestant Emmanuel Kelly appeared on the first episode of the season's audition show on 29 August 2011, and performed a rendition of John Lennon's Imagine . His performance earned a standing ovation from the judges and the audience. Keating was full of praise for Kelly, who then moved into the next round of competition. Keating told Kelly I don't think I've ever been moved as I was by that performance. Kelly and his brother Ahmed were adopted by Children First Foundation boss, Moira Kelly, who is also the guardian of the once conjoined Bangladesh twins, Krishna and Trishna. Kelly and his brother came from Iraq, where they were abandoned at an orphanage and both suffered limb deficiencies as a result of chemical warfare. During the third day of bootcamp, Sebastian eliminated Kelly from the competition, disappointed that he had forgotten words to his song the day before. Emmanuel Kelly appeared and gave an inspirational performance speech and song at the UN Youth Dialogue on 30 May 2018. Another contestant, Luke O'Dell, appeared on the third audition show on 31 August. After failing to impress the judges with his rendition of Kelly Clarkson's Since U Been Gone , O'Dell then sang an original song he wrote titled, Introvert Extrovert , which made him an overnight internet sensation. The song entered the iTunes' Top 100 chart overnight and landed O'Dell thousands of fans on social media and his official YouTube channel. The song title also became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter for more than two hours, following his television performance of the song. Overnight commentary on Twitter and Facebook quickly labelled O'Dell as the Australian version of Rebecca Black, who found fame with her song, Friday . However, O'Dell failed to move through to the next round of the competition. Both Kelly and O'Dell returned to perform on the live grand final decider show. The premiere episode on 29 August 2011 topped the night's overall ratings with 1,319,000 viewers, compared to the 1,186,000 viewers who tuned in to watch the premiere episode of the second season.

Auditions took place throughout June and July 2010, with Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole returning as judges. Minogue missed the auditions and bootcamp due to being on maternity leave, so Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie Lott and Nicole Scherzinger were brought in as guest judges. Cole missed the auditions in Manchester and bootcamp because she had malaria. Following bootcamp, successful acts were split into four categories Boys male soloists aged 16 to 28 , Girls female soloists aged 16 to 28 , Over 28s soloists aged 29 and over and Groups. Minogue and Cole returned for the judges' houses stage, and each judge mentored eight acts through judges' houses. The live shows started on 9 October 2010. Four acts initially eliminated at judges' houses were brought back as wildcards, making this series the first to have 16 acts perform in the live shows. This was the first series of the show to be filmed in high definition, and was simulcast on ITV1 HD and STV HD. From October, The Xtra Factor was also shown in high definition, simulcast on the new channel ITV2 HD. It was sponsored by TalkTalk in the United Kingdom and Domino's Pizza in Ireland. This series proved to be highly controversial, with many people complaining about the use of pitch correction software on the broadcast of contestants' auditions, the decision to form two groups out of rejected soloists at bootcamp, the rejection of popular contestant Gamu Nhengu at judges' houses, Cole abstaining to vote against one of her own acts she mentored in week 5 of the live shows and having a final showdown in the semi final. Controversy also surrounded contestants Shirlena Johnson, who was axed over fears for her mental health, and Treyc Cohen, who was reported to already have a record deal when the live shows started. There were also accusations of fixing, which were denied by the show's producers. Despite the controversies, this series was the most watched series to date, with an average of 14.13 million viewers per episode. The final was watched by 17.71 million people, making it the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK. In February 2010, Dannii Minogue confirmed that she would not attend the auditions for series 7 due to being pregnant. It was confirmed that guest judges would take Minogue's place alongside Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole during the auditions. The guest judges were Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie Lott and Nicole Scherzinger. On 11 June, Minogue was confirmed by ITV to return for the judges' houses stage. Cole missed the Manchester auditions and bootcamp due to having malaria, so Scherzinger returned as a guest judge for bootcamp. Cole then returned for the judges' houses stage. Dermot O'Leary returned for his fourth series as presenter of the main show on ITV, but Holly Willoughby did not return for her third series as presenter on The Xtra Factor on ITV2 and was replaced by Konnie Huq. Brian Friedman returned as creative director, while Ali Tennant and Savan Kotecha were hired as vocal coaches. However, Tennant's contract was ended before the live shows and was replaced by Yvie Burnett, who worked as vocal coach from series 26. Richard Biff Stannard began working as show song producer for Minogue's contestant, and Grace Woodward began working on the show as fashion director. The first appeal for applicants for series 7 was broadcast during series 6 on 5 December 2009.

Dublin returned as an audition city for the first time since the third series in 2006. Halliwell was the first guest judge, and attended the Glasgow auditions. Imbruglia was the second guest judge, appearing for the Birmingham auditions. The guest judge slot was axed for the London auditions, but continued with Perry judging in Dublin, Lott in Cardiff and Scherzinger at the auditions in Manchester. Cole was unable to attend the Manchester auditions because she had contracted malaria and was not replaced for them. The first episode, broadcast on 21 August 2010, featured auditions from Glasgow and London, while episode two, on 28 August, showcased Dublin's auditions and more from London. More London auditions were shown on 4 September, along with those from Birmingham, and Cardiff was featured in 11 September broadcast along with the final set of London auditions. Finally, the Manchester auditions were shown in the 18 and 19 September episodes. The bootcamp stage of the competition began on 22 July 2010 at Wembley Arena, London and was broadcast on 2526 September. Minogue continued her maternity leave and Cole did not attend because she was still in recovery. As Cole and Minogue were absent, producers of the show decided to axe bootcamp's live audience. The bootcamp stage was broadcast in two episodes on 25 and 26 September. The first day of bootcamp saw Cowell and Walsh split the 211 acts into their four categories Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups. They received vocal coaching and each category later performed one song the Boys sang Man in the Mirror , the Girls sang If I Were a Boy , the Over 25s sang Poker Face and the Groups sang Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now . At the end of the day, the number of acts was cut to 108. On the second day, acts were given dance lessons by creative director Brian Friedman but they were not judged on their performances. Scherzinger then returned as a guest judge on the third day, where each act performed one song from a list of 40. On the fifth day, Scherzinger suggested that the Over 25s category be changed to Over 28s, as the quality of older singers was high. The Boys and Girls categories then comprised singers aged 16 to 27, rather than 16 to 24. As the groups category was the weakest, five rejected soloists from the Boys category and four from the Girls category were asked to form two groups, One Direction and Belle Amie respectively. After bootcamp, each judge was assigned a category Cowell was given the Groups, Walsh had the Over 28s, Minogue was asked to look after the Boys and Cole was assigned the Girls. Minogue and Cole returned to the judging panel for the judges' houses stage of the competition, where each judge mentored eight acts, increased from six in previous series. Each judge had help from a guest judge to choose their final acts. Original judge Sharon Osbourne returned to assist Walsh at Adare Manor in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, Cole was assisted by will.i.am in Coworth Park, Ascot, Berkshire, England, Cowell by Sinitta in Marbella, Spain, and Natalie Imbruglia returned to assist Minogue in Melbourne, Australia. Contestants spent a week at judges' houses and performed two songs for their respective judge. Each judge and their guest eliminated five acts, leaving twelve remaining. The judges' houses stage was broadcast in two episodes on 2 and 3 October 2010. In the first live show on 9 October, Paije Richardson, Treyc Cohen, Wagner and Diva Fever were brought back as wildcards. Key The live shows took place at The Fountain Studios in Wembley, north west London. They started on 9 October 2010, with contestants performing on the Saturday night shows and the results being announced on the Sunday night shows. As previously, each week had a different song theme. The two acts with the fewest public votes were in the bottom two and sang again in the final showdown . The songs they performed in the bottom two were of their own choice and did not necessarily follow that week's theme. The four judges then each chose one act from the bottom two that they wanted to be eliminated from the show. If each act received an equal number of judges' votes, the result was deadlocked and the act with the fewest public votes was eliminated. The first live show was extended to two and a half hours to include a surprise twist, namely that each judge was given a wildcard, allowing them to bring back one rejected act from judges' houses, thus bringing the number of finalists up from twelve to sixteen. Owing to the addition of the wildcards, the first two results were double eliminations. The eighth result was also a double elimination. In the case of a double elimination, instead of the bottom two, the bottom three were announced and the act with the fewest votes was automatically eliminated. The two remaining acts from the bottom three then performed in the final showdown. Starting from the eighth week of live shows, contestants performed two songs each on the Saturday night. At the start of each results show, the remaining finalists performed a song as a group. However, the song was pre recorded and the contestants mimed, because of technical issues with mixing the number of microphones. Starting this series, the contestants' live performances were made available to download from iTunes. However, the songs are not eligible to chart to protect the integrity of the contest. Viewers in Ireland were allowed vote again, having been unable to for four years. Each results show featured a number of guest performers. Joe McElderry and Usher performed on the first live results show, and Diana Vickers and Katy Perry performed in the second week. The third results show featured performances from judge Cole and Michael Buble. Rihanna, Bon Jovi and Jamiroquai performed in the fourth results show, and Shayne Ward and Kylie Minogue performed in the fifth week. Take That, Westlife and JLS all performed on the sixth results show, and Olly Murs performed on the seventh. Week eight featured performances from Justin Bieber, The Wanted and Nicole Scherzinger. The cast of Glee performed on the semi final on 5 December, along with Alexandra Burke and The Black Eyed Peas. Rihanna performed again in the first show of the final, and Christina Aguilera also performed. Take That performed again in the second show of the final. The final took place on 11 and 12 December, with each episode lasting two hours. During the first show, the voting lines were frozen and the fourth placed contestant was eliminated. The votes carried over and the third placed contestant left on the second show following another freeze. The final two performed the potential winner's singles before the winner was announced. With the acts in the bottom two receiving two votes each, the result went to deadlock and reverted to the earlier public vote. Belle Amie were eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes. With the acts in the bottom two receiving two votes each, the result went to deadlock and reverted to the earlier public vote. Grimshaw was eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes. For the first time this series, each contestant performed two songs. For the first time in The X Factor history, the judges chose which act they wanted to see progress to the final. 11 December 12 December The series 7 finalists recorded a cover of David Bowie's 1977 song Heroes as a charity single in aid of Help for Heroes, a charity which supports injured servicemen and women. The song was recorded in the week beginning 18 October 2010. The video for the single was filmed on 2 November at Three Mills Studios. All sixteen finalists performed the song on 20 November's results show. It was the third year in a row that finalists have released a charity record. The single entered both the Irish Singles Chart on 25 November 2010 and the UK Singles Chart on 28 November 2010 at number 1. It was reported on 2 December 2010 by the Daily Mirror that the final five contestants, Matt Cardle, Cher Lloyd, One Direction and Rebecca Ferguson, would each record a different song, rather than the same song as in previous series, for their potential debut single. The change was made after Cowell reportedly increased the budget as he wanted songs to suit each act. It was reported on 10 December that Cardle's song would be Many of Horror , Lloyd's would be Impossible , Ferguson's would be Distant Dreamer and One Direction's song would be Forever Young . Cardle and Ferguson performed their songs in the final as the last two remaining acts and upon Cardle's winning the contest, his version of Many of Horror , renamed to When We Collide , was released. It entered both the UK and Ireland Singles Charts at number 1. Over the course of the live shows, 15,488,019 votes were cast. Votes made via landline telephones or from the Red Button service cost 35 pence each, with calls made from mobile telephones expected to be more expensive. The votes brought in revenue of more than 5.4 million, though it was expected to be a lot higher because of the unknown cost of mobile phone votes. Proceeds were split between production company Syco, co producer FremantleMedia, broadcaster ITV and phone vote operator Harvest Media. Advertising slots during the final were sold for up to 250,000, which expected to bring in a further 25 million in advertising revenues, with the number of commercial breaks increased from five to six. For the second year in a row, The X Factor was sponsored by TalkTalk, as part of a three year sponsorship deal thought to be worth 20 million, including sponsorship of the show, the 2011 live tour and rights to online clips. TalkTalk enlisted series 6 contestants Jedward to launch its interactive initiative on 17 August 2010. Viewers were invited to record a video of themselves performing karaoke in front of a TalkTalk bright lights backdrop, and clips were screened as part of TalkTalk's sponsorship break bumpers. In Ireland, where the series was broadcast on TV3, The X Factor was sponsored by Domino's Pizza. The first episode on 21 August attracted 11.88 million viewers on ITV1, the highest ever ratings for a series premiere of The X Factor. It was watched by 46.5 of television viewers during its original broadcast. The episode also received ratings of 568,000 on ITV1 HD. The first live performance show on 9 October 2010 gained 12.62 million viewers, attaining a 48.5 share of the audience during broadcast. The final result on 12 December was the highest rated episode with 16.55 million viewers on ITV1, a 51.5 audience share and 1.16 million viewers on ITV1 HD. It peaked at 19.4 million 18.14 million on ITV1 and 1.3 million on ITV1 HD and was the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK. Official ratings concluded that the series averaged 14.13 million including HD , making it the most watched series to date. The series dominated the weekly rankings, taking up the top position for the first four weeks, then the top two positions until the final. The first part of the final was beaten into fourth rank by two episodes of Coronation Street. The seventh series of The X Factor sparked several heated controversies, with over 5,000 complaints registered with Ofcom throughout the series. A spokesperson told the Daily Mirror newspaper that ITV bosses were worried about the number of complaints as claims that the show had become seedy and oversexed and accusations of fixing would tarnish the image of the show and ITV. On 25 August, it was announced that contestant Shirlena Johnson had been asked to leave the show because of concerns over her mental health. Producers said the medical report from her general practitioner, requested during bootcamp, arrived late. A spokesperson said, The welfare of contestants is of paramount importance, and for this reason it has been agreed that Shirlena Johnson should not continue in the competition. The decision to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists at the end of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked just one of the original applicants. Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as The Wanted and the Spice Girls were created similarly. More controversy erupted after the News of the World reported that after failing to qualify in 2009, Treyc Cohen signed a management deal with Artimis Music Management Ltd that landed her a recording contract in October that year with Birmingham based Ajoupa Records and she released a single entitled A Time to Be Heard . The rules of The X Factor strictly forbid record deals while a contestant is on the show. According to the newspaper, The X Factor was attempting to release Cohen from her management deal and remove the single from sale. Katie Waissel also had to be released from a contract in the United States after her audition. Controversy was caused when Cole chose not to send popular contestant Gamu Nhengu through to the live shows. Nhengu was an early favourite to win and many viewers were angry that Katie Waissel and Cher Lloyd were put through despite failing to complete their performances at judges' houses. Around 1,000 people complained to ITV and by 7 October, 220,000 had joined a Facebook page called Gamu Should Have Got Through . Cole reportedly became the target of death threats, and took extra security precautions in her home as well as at The X Factor. Bookmaker Paddy Power were forced to give odds on Nhengu winning the show after a large number of bets were placed, and made her the favourite to win, but all punters had their losing bets refunded when Nhengu was not chosen as Cole's wildcard. There was speculation that Cole was pressured by producers to axe Nhengu over issues with her visa, but Cole denied those claims, saying it was entirely down to her gut instinct and that she believed Lloyd, Waissel and Rebecca Ferguson were the best singers in her category. Later in her 2012 autobiography Cheryl My Story, Cole confessed that she had chosen Waissel for the live shows because she was more entertaining, claiming ... had spent the past two years drumming into me that we needed acts who would be 'good TV.'...she had the character and drive it took to withstand the pressure of the show, and so I put her through, even though she messed up when she sang in front of Cole and will.i.am. Hundreds of viewers complained when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole abstained from voting against either of her acts who she mentored in the bottom two Cohen and Waissel and was not allowed to vote last in order to send the result to deadlock. When the time came for the judges to determine the result, Cowell was asked to vote first and voted against Cohen. However, O'Leary then asked Cole to vote second rather than last which traditionally occurs when a judge has two of their own acts in the sing off. Cole stated that she wanted to abstain from voting. When O'Leary asked her to clarify what she meant, Cole responded that she was abstaining at that point but wanted O'Leary to ask Minogue and Walsh to cast their votes then ask Cole again where she would vote last and send the result to deadlock. Due to Cole abstaining from voting against Cohen or Waissel when she was asked second, she was not allowed to send the result to deadlock. A spokesperson for The X Factor explained A judge can abstain from placing a vote. Cheryl made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. Dermot went back to her to clarify that it was going to go to a majority vote if she did that. Cheryl was unable to take the vote to deadlock as deadlock requires a valid active vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realized that Cole might abstain and decided that if she did, the result would be decided by a majority vote. After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Cohen received more votes than Waissel, meaning if Cole was allowed to send the result to deadlock, Cohen would have been saved and Waissel wouldve been eliminated. After O'Leary's revelation that producers had rehearsed what would happen if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged to save Waissel, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had been blown out of proportion . O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying We never know which way the judges are going to vote. Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple. The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges cast their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor's bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are total and utter rubbish . Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the public votes cast until after the final. There were accusations from viewers of fixing during the semi final when O'Leary announced that only the public's votes would decide which contestants would move on to the final, but the next day this was changed and there was a final showdown. The show's official website also stated that the result would be decided by the public vote, and Walsh confirmed that on a radio show earlier in the week. It was the first time in the show's history that the judges were given a vote in a semi final. Cowell incorrectly stated that There has always been a sing off when there are five people left in the competition. This is a lot of nonsense about nothing. However, semi finalist, Mary Byrne said she believed the result would be solely down to the public until the day of the semi final performances in which she ended up in the final showdown with Cher Lloyd. She claimed that Cowell wanted Lloyd in the final instead of Byrne because of Cowell constantly praising Lloyds performances and Lloyd as an artist throughout the live shows. Public supporters of Byrne also felt that their votes to get Byrne into the final were wasted and demanded refunds for their votes as they along with the viewers were not notified of the final showdown until the conclusion of the semi final result show and due to the result not being decided by the public vote as Byrne was voted out by the judges. Byrne, viewers and Byrne supporters believed that the final showdown was put in place by producers who scrambled at the last minute, just before the result announcement, more specifically, right after the semi final public voting period closed and when the votes were being counted , only to prevent Byrne from having a place in the final and guarantee Lloyds place if Byrne finished fourth in the public vote and if Lloyd finished last in the public vote. Following Byrne's comments and the accusations by viewers and public supporters of Byrne, Cowell wrote an open letter to the viewers in the Daily Mirror in order to address the controversy and accusations, saying It's always our sole intention to try and make the show as entertaining and hopefully exciting every week. Our main focus is to ensure that the contestants are given every opportunity to benefit from being on the show and show their talent. Throughout the series I have met with fans of the show on a regular basis and have listened and acted on their feedback. I believe they have enjoyed the changes in the show this year and I feel it's been a better series as it hasn't followed the same pattern as before. This year we decided to give four contestants a second chance and introduce them as wild card entrants on the first live show. And having 16 finalists rather than just 12 meant that we introduced both single and double eliminations. We decided for the first time some weeks ago to put four people into the final and this meant having five semi finalists. We also felt it would be fairer that there would be a sing off rather than automatic elimination as there were more contestants. I understand new decisions are seen as controversial by our viewers but it stops the show becoming boring. As the excitement heats up, debates begin but I do want to assure people that the show is definitely not fixed. The sing off on Sunday was something that was always going to happen regardless of who was in the bottom two. The contestants all prepared their save me songs on Monday last week. It was always going to be sad for whoever left. ... I have always listened to and respected our viewers and have always believed viewers ultimately make the right decision. I hope the viewers trust the show that this is a fair competition. Voting statistics revealed that if there was not a final showdown or if Minogue or Cowell voted to send Byrne through to the final or if the result went to deadlock, Byrne wouldve advanced to the final and Lloyd wouldve been eliminated. Following the first episode, viewers complained on social networking websites after it appeared that pitch correction which has been seen as controversial in the music industry was used to improve the quality of some singers' voices, and forty five viewers complained to Ofcom. Series producers claimed post production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they hear on the day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. When it gets to the live shows, it will be all live. It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been materially misled as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants. In December 2010, it emerged that Ofcom were investigating the show after claims that viewers were being encouraged to purchase songs recorded by guest performers Michael Buble and Diana Vickers. Ofcom also received over 2,868 complaints from viewers about raunchy dance routines from Rihanna and Christina Aguilera during the final. Although an ITV spokesperson denied the routines were inappropriate, Cowell was warned by ITV to cut the sleaze . In April 2011, Ofcom ruled that there had been no breach of guidelines over the performances, and highlighted that approximately 2,000 of the complaints were received after the routines were covered by the Daily Mail, and said the newspaper's report featured a number of stills that were significantly more graphic and close up than material broadcast, and that were taken from a different angle to the television cameras . In its 7 December 2010 issue, Heat magazine said series 7 of The X Factor had been the best series to date, citing many of the controversies, plus events such as Lloyd singing on a spiral staircase, Wagner's ludicrous performances and Walsh likening Richardson to a little Lenny Henry , as moments that helped make it the most deliriously, thrilling, controversial and demented yet. ... This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better. Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. Whatever you think of Simon Cowell's programmes, you have to give them credit for achieving that. The series won in the Most Popular Talent Show category at the 16th National Television Awards in 2011, beating series 4 of Britain's Got Talent, series 6 of Dancing on Ice and series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing. It was also nominated in the TV Reality Programme category at the 2011 TRIC awards, the Entertainment Programme category at the 2011 British Academy Television Awards, and the Best Talent Show category at the 2011 TV Choice Awards.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X%20Factor%20%28British%20series%207%29
"X Japan Japanese , Hepburn Ekkusu Japan is a Japanese rock band from Chiba, formed in 1982 by drummer Yoshiki and lead vocalist Toshi. Starting as a predominantly power speed metal band with heavy symphonic elements, they later gravitated towards a progressive sound with an emphasis on ballads. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam. Originally named X , Ekkusu , they released their debut album Vanishing Vision 1988 on Yoshiki's own Extasy Records a year after finalizing their line up including bassist Taiji, lead guitarist hide and rhythm guitarist Pata. They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album Blue Blood. Following 1991's Jealousy, Taiji left the band in early 1992. He was replaced by Heath and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album Art of Life 1993 , which is composed solely of the 29 minute title track. In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released Dahlia 1996 , which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold out New Year's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium. After ten years, X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song I.V. . Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, and formally added Sugizo as lead guitarist in place of hide, who died in 1998, before holding a North American tour in 2010. In 2011, the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia. X Japan has released five studio albums, six live albums, and 21 singles. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, Rolling Stone Japan ranked Blue Blood number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time. In 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan. It has been reported that X Japan have sold over 30 million records. In 1977, Yoshiki and Toshi formed a band called Dynamite in their hometown of Tateyama, Chiba, when they were just 11 years old. Dynamite changed its name to Noise in 1978, while they were still in high school. At this time, Toshi played guitar and they had a singer named Kurata. In 1982, Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, they named it X while they tried to think of another name, but the name stuck. X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup. They originally attempted to pitch in with Japan's underground punk movement, but the band did not fit in with it as they were considered too commercial and flamboyant. Their first single, I'll Kill You was released on Dada Records in June and the band contributed Break the Darkness to the sampler Heavy Metal Force III in November, which also featured a song by Saver Tiger. In November 1985 bassist Taiji ex Dementia joined X, though he left the group shortly thereafter. To ensure a continuous outlet for the band's music, Yoshiki founded the independent label Extasy Records in April 1986, and released their second single Orgasm . Taiji would officially rejoin the band in November of that same year. The songs Stab Me in the Back and No Connexion , for the February 1987 Victor Records sampler Skull Thrash Zone Volume I, were recorded with Pata ex Judy as a support guitar player. Soon after these recordings hide ex Saver Tiger joined as a guitarist. After Pata once again provided support, this time at a live show, he officially joined completing the group's first well known lineup. In August 1987 they performed at the Rock Monster event at Kyoto Sports Valley and gave out their first home video, Xclamation. On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS Sony which led to a recording contract in August of the following year. In the meantime the band released its first album, Vanishing Vision through Extasy Records on April 14, 1988, and toured extensively in support of the record. The album's first press of 10,000 copies sold out in a week, topping the Oricon indies chart and reaching number 19 on the main Oricon Albums Chart, making them the first independent band to appear on the main chart. The Vanishing Tour Vol.2 took the band to 20 locations for 24 shows from June to July, while the Burn Out Tour had 12 performances throughout October. In November, X participated in music magazine Rockin'f's Street Fighting Men concert at Differ Ariake Arena. That year the members also made a brief cameo appearance in the American film Tokyo Pop, starring Carrie Hamilton and Diamond Yukai. X's sold out Blue Blood Tour started on March 13, with two of the concerts selling out in advance, including the March 16 show at Shibuya Public Hall, which was later released on home video as Blue Blood Tour Bakuhatsu Sunzen Gig. The album Blue Blood was released on April 21, 1989, and debuted at number six on the Oricon chart. The single Kurenai reached number five and the band went on the Rose Blood Tour, which was temporarily suspended when Yoshiki collapsed after a November 22 concert. This success earned the band the Grand Prix New Artist of the Year award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1990. On November 24, 1990, X flew to Los Angeles to begin recording their follow up album, Jealousy. When members arrived back in Japan in June, 500 members of the Japan Self Defence Forces were at the airport to control the crowd. The album was released on July 1, 1991, and debuted at number one, selling over 600,000 copies. It was later certified million by the RIAJ. In August the band performed their first concert at Japan's largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. Footage from most of the band's shows in that stadium would later be released on CD and home video. The show was part of the Violence in Jealousy Tour, which lasted to the end of the year and once again saw Yoshiki collapse after the October 24 Yokohama Arena gig. December 8 saw the X with Orchestra concert at NHK Hall, where, as the name suggests, the band performed backed by an orchestra. 1992 began with three sold out concerts at the Tokyo Dome, titled Tokyo Dome 3 Days On the Verge of Destruction, on January 57. The title was possibly more meaningful than it appears at first glance, as on January 31 it was announced that bass player Taiji had left the group. The official reason given for his departure was due to musical differences. However, in his autobiography, Taiji claims he was asked to leave because he confronted Yoshiki due to the substantial income gap between Yoshiki and each of the other members. When asked about Taiji's departure in 2016, Yoshiki said he crossed the line of our band's rules and To this day I still don't know if the decision was right or wrong, but we didn't have a choice. On August 24, 1992, the band held a press conference in New York at Rockefeller Center. There, Heath ex Media Youth was announced as their new bass player. Around this time, the band's success in Japan made an international breakthrough appear likely, leading to them leaving Sony for an American record contract with Atlantic Records and the renaming of the band from X to X Japan, in order to distinguish from the American punk group X. An American album release would never happen. Their first show with Heath was at the October 1992 Extasy Summit at Osaka jo Hall. Art of Life was released on August 25, 1993, by Atlantic Records, and consists solely of the 29 minute, heavily orchestrated title track. It debuted at number one, however the band only performed two concerts that year, as each member began solo careers. Aptly titled X Japan Returns, the concerts were held at the Tokyo Dome on December 30 and 31, marking the beginning of a New Year's Eve tradition that would last until the group's disbandment. The solo careers continued into the following year, with X Japan only performing four shows. The first two were the last two days of The Great Music Experience, and the others were December 3031 at the Tokyo Dome, titled Aoi Yoru , Blue Night and Shiroi Yoru , White Night respectively. 1995 was also quiet, until November 19 when the band began the tour for their next album, Dahlia Tour 19951996. Around this time, the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look. While it wasn't released until November 4, 1996, singles from the album had been released as early as a few months after Art of Life. Though this caused Dahlia to contain relatively little new material, the album reached number one on the charts. The tour was originally scheduled to end on March 31, 1996, however, it was cut short when Yoshiki herniated cervical vertebrae after the March 13 show. They did however perform their tradition of two Tokyo Dome concerts on December 3031, titled Resurrection Night , Fukkatsu no Yoru and Reckless Night , Mubona Yoru . On September 22, 1997, at 1 pm, Yoshiki, hide, Pata and Heath held a press conference where they announced that X Japan would disband. Vocalist Toshi decided to leave the band as the glamorous, success oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally, as opposed to a simpler life and career. He stated that he had made the decision back in April 1996, though it was not publicly disclosed. However, around twelve years later he confirmed what was long reported in the media that he was brainwashed via violence and abuse and conned out of money, leading to bankruptcy. X Japan performed their farewell show, titled The Last Live Last Night, at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive New Year's Eves the group performed at the stadium. Although later that same day they played Forever Love at that year's Kohaku Uta Gassen, marking their true last performance. While reissues, compilations and live footage continued to be released, the members of X Japan pursued solo careers and other projects. hide, who released his first solo album Hide Your Face in 1994, continued his solo career with a sound distinctively different from X Japan's music, leaning more towards alternative rock, until his death on May 2, 1998. Just two months later, the debut album 3.2.1. from his American based band Zilch, which included Ray McVeigh The Professionals , Paul Raven Killing Joke and Joey Castillo Queens of the Stone Age , was released. His third solo album Ja, Zoo, formally including his live band Spread Beaver, was released in November 1998 and became his most successful, having reached number one and sold over a million copies. Prior to his death, hide and Yoshiki talked about restarting X Japan with a new vocalist in the year 2000. Toshi's solo career, which began in 1992, has been extensive, with him having released over 30 albums and performed numerous acoustic shows for smaller audiences. According to his website, his Utatabi Traveling Concert tour included over 3,000 concerts between 1999 and 2003. After both having released solo albums in the early 90s, Pata and Heath teamed up with Spread Beaver percussionist programmer I.N.A., who worked on several of X Japan's releases, to provide a track for the 1998 hide tribute album Tribute Spirits. The three would reunite again in 2000 to form Dope HEADz, which released two albums before ceasing activity. Heath then continued his solo career and Pata formed the instrumental rock group Ra IN, which later added Spread Beaver keyboardist DIE. Before the band's breakup, Yoshiki had already independently collaborated with Queen drummer Roger Taylor on the single Foreign Sand and provided the Japanese contribution to the international Kiss tribute album Kiss My Ass Classic Kiss Regrooved, an orchestral arrangement of the song Black Diamond . A compilation with orchestral treatments of X Japan songs, titled Eternal Melody was also released. It was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and among others featured The Beatles producer George Martin as an arranger. Since 1998 Yoshiki has engaged in numerous activities, such as briefly being a member of the pop band Globe, producing singles for the Korean rock band TRAX and numerous others, as well as working on his solo project Violet UK, which has yet to publish a major release. He has also contributed music to the movie Catacombs and produced the soundtrack of Repo The Genetic Opera. On May 25, 2007, the formation of the supergroup S.K.I.N. was announced, which besides Yoshiki consists of pop rock artists Gackt and Miyavi, as well as Luna Sea guitarist Sugizo. The band gave its first and only performance at the Anime Expo convention in Long Beach, California on June 29, 2007. According to a report by the newspaper Sponichi, Toshi visited Yoshiki in Los Angeles in November 2006 to work on the song Without You as a tribute to hide. On March 21, 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a new project would commence soon. Rumors of an X Japan reunion subsequently began, and in June Yoshiki was reported as having expressed interest in a tour beginning in Los Angeles , Without You being released as a single, and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata regarding their participation. The band made its first public appearance on October 22, 2007, on the rooftop of the shopping center Aqua City in Odaiba, Tokyo, to film a music video for the newly recorded song I.V. . The song was used as the theme of the American horror movie Saw IV. It was written by Yoshiki and recorded with all X Japan members of the pre breakup lineup, as it utilizes previously unreleased guitar tracks by hide. I.V. was released through iTunes on January 23, 2008, topping the store's charts on that day. On January 20, 2008, two Tokyo Dome concert dates were announced for March 28 and March 30. Due to popular demand, they added another concert for the 29th. These three shows were entitled X Japan Resume Attack 2008 I.V. Towards Destruction, with each individual concert titled Night of Destruction, Night of Madness and Night of Creation, respectively, and featured three guest guitarists filling in for the late hide Wes Borland, Richard Fortus and Sugizo. The March 28 concert was aired live on the pay per view channel WOWOW. During the song Art of Life a hologram of hide taken from footage of the Art of Life performance at the Tokyo Dome in 1993 played alongside the band. Because of technical difficulties, possibly due to the hologram, the first concert was delayed for over two hours and later came to an abrupt end when drummer Yoshiki collapsed eight songs into the performance. The subsequent shows were without such difficulties and during a press conference, plans for a concert in Paris, France on July 5, 2008, were announced, with an intended audience of 20,000 people. In addition to the Paris date, plans for concerts at the Madison Square Garden in New York City on September 13, and at the Taipei World Trade Center in Taipei on August 2 were also announced. The hide memorial summit took place on May 3 and 4, 2008 at Ajinomoto Stadium, with X Japan performing the second day, as a tribute to the musician who was also a former X guitarist. Numerous other popular acts such as T.M.Revolution, Oblivion Dust and Versailles also performed, with Phantasmagoria and Luna Sea even reuniting for one day. Organizers planned for an estimated 100,000 fans to attend the two shows. On June 8, it was reported that all of X Japan's previously scheduled shows would be postponed until further notice, due to a recurrence of Yoshiki's disc herniation. The Paris and Taipei concerts were rescheduled, Paris for November 22, 2009. On September 15, 2008, Yoshiki held a press conference in Tokyo, where he announced a new, unnamed X Japan song was in the works. Concerts at Saitama Super Arena on Christmas and New Year's Eve 2008 were also announced. After the conference Yoshiki went on a promotional tour across Asia. On November 7, the French ticketing website Avos announced that the planned ticket sale for the show in Paris would be canceled. Later that day, X Japan released a press statement through their French language website apologizing for the second postponement and announced that the planned Christmas shows would likely suffer a similar fate. On December 31, X Japan performed their New Year's Eve countdown performance at the Akasaka Blitz. On January 15, 2009, the band arrived in Hong Kong for their January 16 and 17 shows. On May 1, it was announced that Sugizo officially joined X Japan as lead guitarist. Since the band still considers the deceased hide a member, Sugizo became the sixth member of X Japan. Their first show with him as a full member was held the next day at the Tokyo Dome, where they played Jade for the first time. The Taiwan concert that was postponed for a second time in January, was finally held on May 30, 2009. On January 9, 2010, the band made its first public U.S. appearance by shooting four new music videos in Hollywood. The four videos were for Rusty Nail , Endless Rain , I.V. , and their new song Jade . In February, Yoshiki confirmed that X Japan will be performing at Lollapalooza in August. Later that month, he announced at a press event that the band would be relocating to Los Angeles, California, with a concert being planned for a simple venue in the city area to mark the band's first official North American show. It was also announced that a sixth album was in the works and was expected to be released in the fall. In March 2010, Yoshiki filed a lawsuit against Nexstar Corporation, for 375 million yen in damages. The band's contract with the company included the use of recordings, the initial deal was for 600 million yen in advance royalties and contract money, which the band claims not to have received. Between 2008 and 2009, the company also sponsored several concerts around Asia and Japan, not having paid performance fees and merchandise sales to X Japan. In all, the total unpaid amount is more than 900 million yen. The lawsuit sought only 375 million yen for the revenue earned from the concerts, with an additional claim of 600 million yen in case the trial proceeded. Yoshiki's side eventually won the lawsuit in 2014, where the Tokyo District Court ordered Nexstar to pay 660 million yen in damages. On July 1, the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic setlist, and recorded a music video for the new song, Born to Be Free . On July 4, the two founding members Toshi and Yoshiki, appeared in Paris at the Japan Expo 2010 where they performed some songs. During the following month, X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Sun Times. X Japan performed at Lollapalooza 2010 in Grant Park, Chicago on August 8. In the following days, Yoshiki did a Q A article with the Phoenix New Times and was interviewed by ABC News. On August 14 and 15, 2010, the band performed a two day show at Nissan Stadium, the largest stadium in Japan. Some media reported an estimated attendance of 140,000 for the two concerts. Ex bassist Taiji joined them on stage both nights as a guest for the song X he would die the following year. Soon after, formerly deceased guitarist hide's management company, Headwax Organization, filed a lawsuit against Yoshiki and X Japan's management, Japan Music Agency, for using images of the former member without a formal agreement in place. The claim states that in 2000 the two companies signed an agreement allowing Yoshiki and X Japan to use visual images of hide during concerts. However, images were used at these Nissan Stadium shows, when apparently the contract already expired. From September 25 to October 10, X Japan performed their first ever North American tour with dates in Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto and New York City. On December 17, Yoshiki announced that a new X Japan song, Scarlet Love Song , was composed for the animated movie adaptation of the Buddha manga. It was announced on January 27, 2011, that X Japan signed a 3 year agreement with EMI in November 2010. The label will handle the American distribution of their single Jade , which was to be released on March 15, and their untitled album, which was set for release in late summer. In promotion of the new album, it was also stated they would be touring extensively around the world throughout 2011. X Japan performed on March 6 at Asia Girls Explosion, a fashion event and music concert that Yoshiki created with Jay FR. It was announced they would perform in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru later in the year. Due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11, the band decided to postpone the release of Jade until June 28. Yoshiki also decided to auction off one of his used signature Kawai crystal grand pianos, of which all proceeds were sent to help provide aid to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami. Scarlet Love Song was released in Japan on June 8, and on June 28 their first worldwide single, Jade , was released, both on iTunes. That same day they performed in London, the first concert of the European leg of their ongoing world tour, which was followed by Paris on July 1, Utrecht on July 2 and Berlin on July 4. X Japan also performed at the 2011 Summer Sonic festival that was held on August 13 and 14, in Tokyo and Osaka. Their world tour's South American leg took them to Santiago on September 9, Sao Paulo on September 11, Buenos Aires on September 14, Lima on September 16 and Mexico City on September 18. The Asian leg of the tour brought stops in Seoul on October 28, Shanghai on October 30, Hong Kong on November 4, Taipei on November 6 and Bangkok on November 8. The Beijing show, originally scheduled for November 2, was cancelled by the promoters on October 25 due to technical and production issues . After more than two years of inactivity, X Japan announced the remastered compilation album The World X Japan Hatsu no Zensekai Best for release on June 17, 2014. Prior to its physical release, a digital version titled X Japan World Best became available in 111 countries via iTunes on May 21. They performed at Yokohama Arena on September 30 and October 1, and at Madison Square Garden on October 11. At both concerts, the cover of the song Beneath The Skin was played, originally written by Sugizo for S.K.I.N., the group formed by Yoshiki in 2007. They participated in Music Station Super Live 2014 on New Year's Eve, marking their first television appearance in seventeen years, the last being on Kohaku Uta Gassen in 1997. In June 2015, Yoshiki announced X Japan's sixth and first studio album in 20 years would be released on March 11, 2016.

The soundtrack reached No. 4 in its first week in the Oricon Albums Chart, No. 27 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 1 in the UK Rock Metal Albums Chart. On March 3, 2017, an album signing took place at HMV in Oxford Street, London. All the copies of the physical copies of the We Are X soundtrack available at the signing were sold in the event. According to store staff, this was the first time there was a sell out of all physical copies at such a signing. A new song, La Venus was used as the ending theme song for We Are X and was one of 91 songs in contention for nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the 89th Academy Awards. In April 2017, Yoshiki announced that the sixth album's songs were ready and only mixing and mastering remained, and release was expected in the next few months . When Yoshiki performed on BBC Radio 4's Front Row on October 20, 2017, it was announced the sixth album would be released in Spring 2018. On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's management announced that the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, it was reported that concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed as an acoustic tour, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain whether he would be able to play the drums in the future. In November it was announced that X Japan will perform at the year end Kohaku Uta Gassen, as part of the White Team. The band performed a medley of Endless Rain and Kurenai , and during the performance Yoshiki played drums again for the first time since his neck surgery. The January 2018 issue of Neo magazine named X Japan the Best Musical Act in their annual awards, with We Are X named the Best Asian Movie . In February 2018, the band's performance at Wembley in 2017 was named the Best Event at Wembley Arena in the 2017 SSE Live Awards. In March 2018, We Are X was named the Best Music Film in the Space Shower Music Awards. On April 10 and 11 the band performed at Zepp Divercity in Tokyo for a limited audience, and the concert was broadcast live across Asia in selected theaters. Richard Fortus, Wes Borland, and Miya of Mucc appeared as guest musicians. All three also joined X Japan for their first performance at the Coachella festival on April 14. At the second weekend of the festival, Marilyn Manson joined the band on stage and performed Sweet Dreams with Yoshiki on piano. When interviewed for KLOS's Jonesy's Jukebox, Yoshiki said the album would be released in either summer or fall 2018. In July, it was also announced that X Japan would perform at the TV Asahi Dream Festival on September 15. On Christmas Day 2018, X Japan were named 43rd in that year's Oricon Favourite Artists poll. In an interview with JRock News on February 13, 2019, Yoshiki said X Japan's album is actually completed. It took over 10 years to record, I'm looking for the perfect timing to release it. X Japan's music developed in the wake of American and British glam and heavy metal music, and is characterized by driving speed power metal compositions with symphonic elements e.g. Kurenai , Silent Jealousy and emotional ballads e.g. Endless Rain , Forever Love . Many of the group's songs make use of orchestrated passages, particularly on longer tracks such as the ten and a half minute Tears , Crucify My Love , and the twenty nine minute Art of Life . The majority of the band's lyrics are in Japanese, the band's native language, however many instances show the lyrics alternating from Japanese to English and back. Examples of this include the spoken word background vocals during the bridge of Rusty Nail , and multiple lines including the entire pre chorus of the song Week End . The first recorded version of Kurenai from Vanishing Vision contains lyrics entirely in English. The majority of the band's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. hide contributed several songs, including the single Scars , while Pata's only claim is White Wind from Mr. Martin Pata's Nap . Toshi's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music to a couple of songs, notably Voiceless Screaming from the album Jealousy, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and Desperate Angel . Heath's only writing credit is the instrumental song Wriggle on the 1996 album Dahlia, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, Easy Fight Rambling on the 1989 album Blue Blood. Of songs from the band's lesser known former members, only the track Time Trip Loving from the single Orgasm , composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since. That year, Yoshiki claimed that their new material was pretty much the same thing, maybe a little edgier. However, in 2014 he specifically stated it will not be the same as before, adding that it will be very heavy, melodic, and more contemporary. Yoshiki's songwriting process is unusual in that he writes the score for each song by hand before beginning to play it with the band. His composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff based motifs or call and response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances the band relies, for the most part, on its members with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings, spoken word passages, and more recently, some of hide's guitar parts. X Japan's appearance was inspired by glam rock, Kiss, David Bowie, as well as traditional Japanese kabuki theatre, where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women. Visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage. According to Josephine Yun, like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewtichingly effeminate one moment and a full force, wrist breaking literally hurricane in concert the next. Will Hodgkinson of The Times described X Japan as having, the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with a healthy dose of melodrama. Their early image was characterized by heavy make up, dark eyeliner and eyeshadow, face painting and high standing hair, which one critic described as skyscraper hair . Yoshiki's highly androgynous looks, dressed in lace and pearls, were referred to as decadent . The band also used accessories reminiscent of glam goth metal jewelry, crosses . Their stage reflected the band's duality in nature the forceful, masculine heavy metal songs were balanced out by Toshi's high pitched tenor voice and Yoshiki's soft piano play, where he would often wear long female dresses, and act effeminate. By the release of their 1995 studio album Dahlia, the band toned its stage appearance down, cutting their hair and wearing more rock inspired outfits. In a 2010 interview, Yoshiki stated that the abandoning of stronger make up and outrageous outfits was a natural progression in their style, however, they still do use make up on stage, sometimes heavy, sometimes less and that he still considers the band visual kei. X Japan are considered one of the founders of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock . In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying when we started the band, the problem was we didnt belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make up and crazy outfits. So we couldnt belong anywhere , that eventually became visual kei. He added But visual kei is more like a spirit, its not a music style or, you know... I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, thats what I believe visual kei is. Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboard's Steve McClure declared it the end of an era , explaining X were the first generation of visual kei bands ... For the next generation of bands, it's like That's it. The torch has been passed to us. Many bands and artists, most related to visual kei, count them as an influence or look up to them, including Miyavi, Dir en grey, Syu and Fumiya of Galneryus, The Gazette, D, Sadie vocalist Mao, Toru Kawauchi from 12012, Maya of LM.C, Flow, Yuuki from Unsraw, DJ Ozma, Kei of Dio Distraught Overlord, aie from Deadman, Screw's Jin, and DaizyStripper. The members of Versailles named X and Luna Sea as influences, with singer Kamijo saying I think there isn't anyone in the Japanese music business who hasn't been influenced by them. Likewise, Leda of Galneryus and Deluhi claims he was not even interested in music until a friend played him X Japan and Luna Sea, and also declared X Japan's music his Bible . Established musicians Dancho Nogod , Miya Mucc , Yuu Merry , Akane ex The Scanty and Daisuke Jupiter occasionally perform in a X Japan cover band called X Suginami. American musician Marty Friedman called X Japan the biggest band in visual kei and by far the most versatile musically, and cited them as the reason he got into Japanese rock music. In We Are X, Gene Simmons claims that if the X Japan members were born in America or England and sang in English, they might be the biggest band in the world. Due to band's various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi's brainwashing and lack of overseas success, X Japan have been described in The Times as The world's unluckiest band , in an article published on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered Kinda I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', but what I can say is 'the world's luckiest band'. Thanks to our fans. The group was popular among rebellious youths, who were attracted to, as Asiaweek put it, the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered. Their music was described by Asiaweek as having an angry sound that rejected the cookie cutter principles of Japanese society. In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton Lewis explained In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans they dress like it, they breathe it. In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice. X have also been named one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent record label. In 1990, they won the Grand Prix New Artist of the Year award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards. HMV Japan ranked the band number 40 on a 2003 list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts, and in 2010 they came in third in a poll by Oricon on which Japanese bands people want around for future generations. In 2011, Consequence of Sound named X Japan one of their Top 15 Cult Acts. In April 2012, X Japan won the Revolver Golden Gods Award for Best International Artist . They were awarded Most Devoted Fans in the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards on January 17, 2013, and won the poll again two years later on February 3, 2015. Later that year, they also won the website's Best Live Band Tournament in August, beating out Pearl Jam in the final round. LA Weekly ranked X Japan tenth on an October 2014 list of the 10 Best Prog Metal Bands. In March 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan writing that their high octane power metal and exhilarating live show make them the pinnacle of heavy music in the Land of the Rising Sun. However, X Japan have also made a mark outside of the music industry. In 1999, at the request of the Japanese government, Yoshiki composed and performed a classical song for Japan's Emperor Akihito at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of his enthronement. Japan's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is a well known fan of the band. His political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, even used X's song Forever Love in several commercials in 2001. It was also reported that Koizumi was influential in getting the hide Museum opened in Yokosuka in 2000. Yoshiki stated he loved the punkish elements of the albums Iron Maiden and Killers by Iron Maiden. He also cited Sex Pistols, The Clash, G.B.H. and Chaos UK as favorite bands. X Japan performed 7 times on Kohaku Uta Gassen, a prestigious year end television show on NHK network.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%20Japan
"Pilot is the pilot episode of the science fiction television series The X Files. The episode aired on September 10, 1993 on the Fox network in the United States and Canada, and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1. The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Robert Mandel. As the pilot, it would set up the mythology storyline for the series. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 7.9 and was viewed by 7.4 million households and 12.0 million viewers. The episode itself was generally well received by fans and critics alike, which led to a growing cult following for the series before it hit the mainstream. The pilot introduced the two main characters, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively. The episode also featured William B. Davis, Charles Cioffi and Zachary Ansley as the recurring characters of the Smoking Man, Scott Blevins and Billy Miles. The Smoking Man would go on to become the series' signature antagonist, appearing in every season except the eighth. The episode follows FBI Special Agents Mulder and Scully on their first X File case together, investigating a string of deaths which Mulder believes to be alien experiments. Inspired by Kolchak The Night Stalker, the series was conceived by Chris Carter in an attempt to scare people's pants off . When creating the characters of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, Carter decided to play against established stereotypes, making the male character a believer and the female a skeptic, as the latter role had traditionally been a male one on television. Principal photography for Pilot took place over fourteen days during March 1993 using a budget of 2 million, the scenes were filmed in and around the Vancouver area. Vancouver would remain the area for production for the next five years, although production would move to Los Angeles from the beginning of the sixth season at the behest of David Duchovny. In Bellefleur, Oregon, teenager Karen Swenson is seen fleeing through the forest. When she falls, a dark figure approaches, and they both become enveloped in light. Swenson's body is later found by Bellefleur detectives, with two small marks on her back. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Special Agent Dana Scully Gillian Anderson is summoned to a meeting with Division Chief Scott Blevins Charles Cioffi and a seemingly anonymous government official, The Smoking Man William B. Davis . She is assigned to work with Special Agent Fox Mulder David Duchovny on the X Files, an obscure FBI section covering purportedly paranormal cases. Blevins has assigned Scully for the implicit purpose of using her scientific knowledge to debunk Mulder's work, although Blevins never directly tells Scully this and is evasive when she asks if such is his intent. Scully introduces herself to Mulder, who shows her evidence from the Swenson case. He notes that she was the fourth member of her high school class to die under mysterious circumstances. Mulder also notes an unknown chemical compound found on her body, as well as similarities between her death and others from across the country. Mulder believes that Swenson's death is due to extraterrestrial activity. However, the skeptical Scully expresses disbelief in Mulder's theory. When Mulder and Scully's plane flies over Bellefleur, it encounters unexplained turbulence. As they drive in the woods near the town, the agents' car radio malfunctions Mulder marks the spot of this event by spray painting an X onto the road. Mulder arranges for the exhumation of the third victim, Ray Soames, despite the protests of Dr. Jay Nemman, the county medical examiner. When Soames' coffin is opened, a deformed body is found inside, which Scully concludes is not Soames, but an orangutan. However, she finds a metal implant in the body's nasal cavity. Mulder and Scully visit the psychiatric hospital where Soames was committed before his death and meet two of Soames' former classmatesthe comatose Billy Miles Zachary Ansley and the wheelchair using Peggy O'Dell. O'Dell suffers from a nosebleed during the agents' visit, and is seen to bear marks similar to Swenson's. Outside the hospital, Mulder explains to Scully that he believes Miles, O'Dell, and the victims to be alien abductees. That night, the agents investigate the forest Scully discovers strange ash on the ground, leading her to suspect cult activity. However, a local detective arrives and orders them to leave. Driving back to their motel, Mulder and Scully encounter a flash of light at the spot their car had malfunctioned earlier. When the car loses power, Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash, a phenomenon reported by alien abductees. At the motel, Mulder tells Scully that his sister Samantha vanished when he was twelve, which has driven his work in the paranormal. The agents receive an anonymous call telling them that O'Dell has been killed in traffic while on foot. They visit the scene, finding O'Dell's body and no wheelchair. They return to find the motel on fire and their evidence destroyed. Nemman's daughter Theresa contacts the agents for help. She tells them that she has awakened in the middle of the woods several times, though her father and the detective, revealed to be Billy Miles' father, arrive and take her away. The agents return to the cemetery to exhume the other victims, only to find the graves already dug up and the coffins missing. Mulder realizes that Billy is responsible for bringing the victims to the woods. Returning to the woods, they again encounter Detective Miles, but hear a scream and find Billy nearby with Theresa in his arms. There is a flash of light, and Billy and Theresa are recovered unharmed. A couple weeks later, Miles is put under hypnosis. He recalls how he and his classmates were abducted in the forest as they celebrated their graduation they were subjected to tests by the aliens, and started killing them when the tests failed. Scully provides Blevins with the metal implant, the only remaining piece of evidence. However, she later learns from Mulder that Miles' case files are missing. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man stores the implant away in a vast evidence room within the Pentagon. When conceiving the episode, Chris Carter wanted to scare people's pants off . A noted influence on the episode's conception was Kolchak The Night Stalker, a series from the 1970s. This led to an idea of two agents investigating paranormal events. When creating the characters of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, Carter decided to play against established stereotypes, making the male character a believer and the female a skeptic, as the latter role had traditionally been a male one on television. When casting the actors for the two main parts, Carter had difficulties finding an actor for Scully. When he cast Gillian Anderson for the part, the network wanted to replace her. Carter believed they responded negatively towards the casting because she didn't have the obvious qualities that network executives have come to associate with hit shows . Calling her a terrific actress , Carter reacted overall positively towards Anderson's audition saying she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew ... she was the right person for the part . David Duchovny on the other hand, was met with more positive response from the network, Carter even saying he was an early favorite . William B. Davis, who made his first appearance as the recurring villain The Smoking Man in this episode, had originally auditioned for a larger part in the episode, saying I auditioned for the senior FBI agent who had three lines. I didn't get that partI got the part with no lines . Principal photography for Pilot took place over fourteen days during March 1993 using a budget of 2 million. Filming of the episode took place in and around Vancouver, British Columbia. The series would use the area for production for the next five years, although production would move to Los Angeles from the beginning of the sixth season at the behest of David Duchovny. The scene set in the town's graveyard was shot in Queen Elizabeth Park, marking the first time the location had been used to represent a graveyard the location would later be used for the same purpose in the fourth season episode Kaddish . The interior shots of the psychiatric hospital were filmed in a disused building owned by Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, and marked the first time that the crew met with producer R. W. Goodwin. The episode's final warehouse scene was filmed in a document warehouse belonging to the headquarters of the Canadian television network Knowledge. An office in the same building was also used for the boardroom meeting at the beginning of the episode. The scenes involving the Smoking Man required special permission to be filmed, in order to allow for actor William B. Davis to smoke in a public building. All of the interior shots of the FBI headquarters were filmed in the main newsroom of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as the production crew found that the open plan offices they wished to represent no longer existed, having typically been converted into cubicles. However, it was found that working around the CBC's broadcast schedule was too unwieldy, and later episodes of the series replicated the location on a sound stage. The forest scenes were shot on location in Lynn Valley, in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserveformerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest. The crew spent 9,000 building wooden pathways for equipment, cast and crew to move easily through the area. Additional scenes were filmed at the headquarters for BC Hydro whilst Scully's apartment was represented by a location used only in this episode and the third episode, Squeeze use of this location was discontinued once it became apparent that most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street. Make up effects artist Toby Lindala was tasked with creating a prop which would allow actress Sarah Koskoff to simulate a nosebleed on camera, rather than through the use of off screen make up and editing tricks. However, during test shots, the prop's tubing burst, causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff's forehead, rather than from her nose. Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character, Dana Scully, visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites. The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous, saying there really wasn't a reason for it. The bites could have been on my shoulder or something. However, Carter has explained that the scene was simply intended to highlight the platonic relationship between the two lead roles. Post production work on the episode was finished by May 1993, with the final version of the episode being assembled only three hours before its preview screening for the network's executives. Stock footage of the exterior of the J. Edgar Hoover Building was added to the episode, although later episodes would film new exterior shots using Simon Fraser University as a stand in location. The climactic abduction scene featuring Billy Miles in a forest clearing featured a swirling vortex of leaves created using computer imagery by the series' visual designer Mat Beck which Carter has described as being more complicated to achieve than the Normandy landings. The original script gives more insight into Scully's visit to Scott Blevins' office. The scene that introduces Scully in the script is set just before her visit and takes place at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, where she teaches a small group of trainees about the physiology of homicide, specifically electrocution and death by cattle prod. Her attention is distracted by an agent who enters the room and hands her a note that reads, Your attendance is required in Washington at 1600 hrs. sharp . Scully checks her digital watch, which reads 1 03. The majority, at the least, of this scene was actually filmed but the scene was omitted from the final version of the episode. The next scene is that in which Scully reports to the receptionist at FBI headquarters the script includes Scully showing her badge to the receptionist and dialogue for the role of the receptionist as she tells Scully, See Section Chief Blevins. Third floor, violent crime division. In the final version of the episode, Scully's badge does not appear in any of the scenes and the receptionist does not speak. Two filmed scenes were cut from the final version of the episode. Both featured Tim Ransom as Scully's boyfriend Ethan Minette. In the first, Minette and Scully meet, with Scully cancelling plans for a holiday the two had arranged, due to her assignment to the Oregon case. The second scene briefly shows Scully answering a telephone call from Mulder whilst asleep in bed with Minette, though the latter has no dialogue. The addition of Scully's boyfriend was an attempt by the Fox executives to create the romantic interest that they felt was not there between Mulder and Scully. Chris Carter ultimately found that it was very easy to remove the character from the episode, both because his appearances seemed to slow down the scenes in which Mulder and Scully are together and due to the fact that Carter found Scully's relationship with her FBI partner to actually be more interesting and exciting than her relationship with her boyfriend. Pilot premiered on the Fox network on September 10, 1993, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on September 19, 1994. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.9, with a 15 share, meaning that roughly 7.9 percent of all television equipped households, and 15 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 7.4 million households and 12.0 million viewers. Pilot was well received by several of the series' future crew members. Producer and writer Glen Morgan felt that the episode's merging of Silence of the Lambs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind was impressive he also felt that it was the only truly scary series on television at the time. Writer Howard Gordon stated that the pilot set the tone of the show really successfully , noting the difficulty inherent in introducing both a series' premise and its main cast in forty eight minutes and finding that the episode had achieved both, being a tremendous synthesis of all the parts . Chris Carter also recounted that the episode's test screening for Rupert Murdoch and other Fox executives was met with spontaneous applause . Den of Geek's Matt Haigh on Pilot The episode was generally well received by fans and critics alike. Variety magazine criticized the episode for using reworked concepts , but praised the production and noted its potential.

The magazine concluded, Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self conscious, and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV. Entertainment Weekly noted that Scully was set up as a scoffing skeptic in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of just four episodes, the magazine called The X Files the most paranoid, subversive show on TV , noting the marvelous tension between Andersonwho is dubious about these eventsand Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer .

"The first season of the science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on September 10, 1993, and concluded on the same channel on May 13, 1994, after airing all 24 episodes. The first season introduced main characters of the series, including Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, respectively, and recurring characters Deep Throat, Walter Skinner, and Cigarette Smoking Man. The season introduced the series' main concept, revolving around the investigation of paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X Files, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation it also began to lay the groundwork for the series' overarching mythology. Initially influenced by Kolchak The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone, series creator Chris Carter pitched the idea for the series to Fox twice before it was accepted for production. The season saw the series quickly gaining popularity, with ratings rising steadily throughout its run and garnered generally positive reviews from critics and the media. It helped to make stars of its two lead roles, and several of its taglines and catchphrases have since become cultural staples. Although Carter initially conceived of the series based on the influence of Kolchak and The Twilight Zone, he has stated that the leaping off point for the series' overall concept came from UFO lore. After being introduced to the works of John E. Mackespecially a study by Mack which had reported that three percent of Americans claimed to have been abducted by aliensCarter believed he had found his central theme. It was decided that the series would focus on the FBI in order to avoid something Carter had seen as a failing in Kolchak, whereby mysterious events would continually occur in one locale and be accidentally uncovered by the same characterby creating a fictional FBI unit which actively uncovered these paranormal cases, it was felt that the series would be sustainable week after week without stretching the parameters of credibility . Early in the planning stages, Carter had envisioned that a significant proportion of the episodes would deal with investigations which uncovered hoaxes or cases which had been mistakenly viewed as paranormal. Although this decision never came to pass, the third season episode Jose Chung's From Outer Space can be seen as a holdover from the idea. The series revolves around its two main characters, which had been defined early in conception as the believer and the skeptic . Of these, the believer , Fox Mulder, was created with a character defining personal motivation, involving the disappearance of his younger sister during his childhood, which he would believe to be a result of alien abduction. The creation of the skeptic , Dana Scully, was influenced by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, leading the crew to decide that the character needed to seem real , as opposed to the bombshell type of character the studio was pressing for. Thematically, although the series focused heavily on alien abduction lore, the decision was made early on to allow the plots of individual episodes to branch out into different territories in order to prevent the overarching plot from running out of momentum, which led to standalone episodes such as Squeeze being developed. The variety of storylines which the series has shown has led director Daniel Sackheim to note that The X Files has sort of found its own style in that it doesn't have a confined style to it , adding that the series' fluid approach has meant that everybody who comes on the show attempt to make a little scary movie . To this end, several episodes feature varying plots, with alien influenced storylines varying between Ice , a briskly paced episode set in a single location, and the character driven Conduit , which served to fill in background on the characters. Elsewhere, plots focused on soul transference or reincarnation, with the episodes Shadows , Born Again and Lazarus sharing similar storylines. The tired plot of Ghost in the Machine featured a malevolent artificial intelligence while Shapes introduced the first of what would become several Native American themed episodes. The first season also introduced a number of minor characters who would go on to become central figures to the seriesThe Lone Gunmen, first seen in E.B.E. , would become regular characters beginning the second season, eventually starring in the spin off series The Lone Gunmen whilst the episode Tooms introduced Walter Skinner, portrayed by Mitch Pileggi, who would go on to be billed as a series star by the ninth season. The abduction of Mulder's sister Samantha was explored in the episodes Pilot , Conduit , and Miracle Man , and would go on to become one of the central themes of the series as a whole. California native Chris Carter was given the opportunity to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, inspired by a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, and recalling memories of Watergate and the 1970s horror series Kolchak The Night Stalker, Carter came up with the idea for The X Files and wrote the pilot episode himself in 1992. He initially struggled over the untested conceptexecutives wanted a love interest for Scullyand casting. The network wanted either a more established or a taller, leggier, blonder and breastier actress for Scully than the 24 year old Gillian Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience, who Carter felt was the only choice after auditions. Carter's initial pitch for The X Files was rejected by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak The Night Stalker and The Twilight Zone in his youth as well as from the then recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel Diana Rigg and John Steed Patrick Macnee in the series The Avengers. During the early stages of production for the series, Carter founded Ten Thirteen Productions, and began to plan for filming the pilot in Los Angeles. However, unable to find suitable locations for many of the scenes, Ten Thirteen Productions made the decision to go where the good forests are , and moved production to Vancouver, where the series would remain for the next five seasons production would eventually shift to Los Angeles beginning with the sixth season. It was soon realized by the production crew that since so much of the first season would require filming on location, rather than on sound stages, two location managers would be needed, rather than the usual one. David Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles three years prior to The X Files, and at first had wanted to base his acting career around films. But in 1993 his manager, Melanie Green, gave him a script for the pilot episode of series. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so Duchovny auditioned for the lead. When Duchovny was auditioning for the part of Fox Mulder, he made a terrific audition, but spoke rather slowly. Chris Carter thought at the beginning of the auditioning for the character, he was a good judge of character , and thought that Duchovny wasn't rather bright . So he went and talked to Duchovny and asked him if he could please imagine himself as an FBI agent for the future week. The casting director of the show was very positive towards him. According to Carter, Duchovny turned out to be one of the best read people he knew. Carter recalls being contractually obliged to provide Fox with a choice of two actors for the role however, he was confident Duchovny was the right choice from the outset. After getting the role, Duchovny thought the show wouldn't last for long or that it wouldn't make much impact. Gillian Anderson was cast due to insistence from Carter that she would fit the role perfectly however, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous bombshell for the part, hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element. This led Carter to insist that he did not want the roles of Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved, citing the relationship between the lead roles in Moonlighting as an example to avoid. Anderson called her early work on the show a complete learning experience for me the pilot was only the second time I'd been in front of a camera . The series also introduced the character of Walter Skinner, played by Mitch Pileggi, who would go on to become a recurring, and later, main character in the show. The character had been conceived as playing against the stereotypical bureaucratic paper pusher , being instead someone more quietly dynamic . Pileggi had auditioned unsuccessfully for several other parts on the series before being cast as Skinner. At first, the fact that he was asked back to audition for the role had puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not cast for the previous partsChris Carter had been unable to imagine Pileggi as any of those characters, due to the fact that the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi attended the audition for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back. Pileggi's attitude fit well with the character of Skinner, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. After successfully auditioning for the role, Pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role of Walter Skinner. Glen Morgan and James Wong's early influence on The X Files mythology led to their introduction of popular secondary characters who would continue for years in episodes written by others, such as the Scully familyDana's father William Don S. Davis , mother Margaret Sheila Larken and sister Melissa Melinda McGraw as well as conspiracy buff trio The Lone Gunmen. Initially, there was no certainty as to how long the series would go on for, and as a result there was no long term plan in the beginning to guide its writers. Although the initial impetus for the show was based on alien abduction lore, the crew believed that the series would not be able to maintain its momentum for long if it did not branch out into different plot ideas. The show's first season thus featured numerous standalone stories involving monsters, and also diverse alien or governmental cover ups, often with no apparent connection to each othersuch as the Arctic space worms in Ice , and the conspiracy of genetically engineered twins in Eve . Carter himself wrote Space , an intended bottle episode about the manifestation of an alien ghost in the NASA space shuttle program, which was subject to cost overruns and became the most expensive of the first season. By the end of the first season, Carter and his staff had come up with many of the general concepts of the mythology that would last throughout all nine seasons. The first season introduced the series' primary antagonist, Cigarette Smoking Man, and gave early insight into the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha, whose abduction provided one of the main plot threads of the series as a whole. The emergent mythology was further solidified in the Carter penned, Edgar Award nominated season finale The Erlenmeyer Flask . The episode was written in early 1994 before it was known whether or not the series would be renewed for a second season, and featured the closure of the X Files unit and the reassignment of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to new jobs within the FBI. The finale was the first episode directed by R. W. Goodwin, who had served as producer for the series. Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote nine episodes. Co executive producers and writing team Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote six episodes. Supervising producers and writing team Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon wrote five episodes together, with Gordon co writing an additional script with Carter. Co producers and writing team Larry and Paul Barber wrote one episode. Kenneth Biller and Chris Brancato co wrote a freelance script. Other freelance writers included Scott Kaufer, Marilyn Osborn and Chris Ruppenthal, who each wrote one episode. Other producers included line producer Joseph Patrick Finn and co producer Paul Rabwin. David Nutter directed the most episodes of the first season, directing six. Pilot supervising producer Daniel Sackheim directed two episodes. Other directors that directed two episodes included Jerrold Freedman, William Graham, Michael Lange, Joe Napolitano and Larry Shaw. One episode directors included Rob Bowman, Fred Gerber, co executive producer R. W. Goodwin, Michael Katleman, Harry Longstreet and Robert Mandel who directed the pilot episode. Episodes marked with a double dagger are episodes in the series' alien mythology arc. From the outset, viewing figures for the series were good, with the initial broadcast of Pilot being watched by 7.4 million households, which constituted 15 percent of the viewing audience at the time. The series was broadcast directly after episodes of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., and saw a decline in viewing figures when that series began to falter. The seasonand series as a wholereached a low with Fallen Angel , which was viewed by only 5.1 million households. However, after the episode aired, the numbers began to rise steadily once again, reaching a peak for the season with The Erlenmeyer Flask , which was viewed by 8.3 million households, 16 percent of the available audience. At the conclusion of the 199394 television season, The X Files ranked 105th out of 128 shows. The ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to be classified as a cult hit , particularly by Fox standards, and was subsequently renewed for a second season. Reviews for the first season were mostly positive, with the series being described as the most paranoid, subversive show on TV , and the writing being called fresh without being self conscious, and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV . The season as a whole currently holds a 100 rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on eleven reviews. On Metacritic, the season scored 70 out of 100, based on 13 reviews, indicating Generally favorable reviews . Writing for IGN, Mike Miksch noted that some of the episodes were at a level of excellence that still hasn't been matched since adding that the series has become nearly as integral to pop culture today as any show in history . Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits gave the season an A , stating The X Files is a show that dared to be different, and different it was . Hunt described the show's cinematography as striking and noir ish . Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, called the season phenomenal and added that it contains many terrific episodes . Several episodes were widely praised, including Squeeze , which has been called profoundly creepy the taut and briskly paced Arctic set Ice and the remarkably chilling Scully centered episode Beyond the Sea . However, not all episodes of the season were as well received. Despite the costly production of Space , the episode was derided as decidedly unscary and a little tasteless in its treatment of the Challenger disaster. The Jersey Devil was described as pretty silly , whilst the plots for Shadows , Born Again , and Roland were panned for being much too similar to each other. The first season received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with one win. Composer Mark Snow was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Main Title Theme Music, while title designers Bruce Bryant, James Castle and Carol Johnsen won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29
"The second season of the science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on September 16, 1994, concluded on the same channel on May 19, 1995, after airing all 25 episodes. The series follows Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, who investigate paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X Files by the FBI. The second season of The X Files takes place after the closure of the department following the events of the first season finale. In addition to stand alone Monster of the Week episodes, several episodes also furthered the alien conspiracy mythology that had begun to form. Season two introduced several recurring charactersX Steven Williams , an informant to Mulder Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , Mulder's partner turned enemy and the Alien Bounty Hunter Brian Thompson , a shape shifting assassin. The storylines were widely affected by the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson it was decided that Scully would be kidnapped and abducted by aliens, explaining her absence and allowing her to appear comatose two episodes later, which ultimately added more intricacies to the mythology. The season earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations. The premiere Little Green Men , debuted with a Nielsen household rating of 10.3 and was viewed by 9.8 million households, marking a noticeable increase in viewership since the previous year. The series rose from number 111 to number 63 for the 199495 television year. In addition, the show's second season has generally received positive reviews from television critics. Dana Scully Gillian Anderson is reassigned to teach at the FBI Academy while Fox Mulder David Duchovny is given lowly surveillance assignments. After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , and meets a secretive informant, X Steven Williams . Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis . When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re opens the X Files, claiming that is what the conspirators will fear most. Scully turns up comatose in a hospital four week later with no explanation about how she got there. X provides Mulder with information allowing him to take revenge on her captors, but Mulder is instead convinced by Scully's sister Melissa to visit her bedside. Scully recovers and returns to work shortly thereafter. The agents later investigate a case involving alien biology being injected into teenagers in Wisconsin, and once again they encounter Deep Throat's killer, who is killed by the local sheriff. When investigating a case involving the murder of identical doctors, the agents come across a shapeshifting Alien Bounty Hunter Brian Thompson responsible for executing a series of alien clones. During this case a grown woman claiming to be Mulder's sister Samantha appears, telling Mulder of the Bounty Hunter's objectives and that she has the ability to identify him. When Scully is kidnapped by the Bounty Hunter, Mulder is forced to trade Samantha for her. During a botched attempt to kill the Bounty Hunter, Samantha is killed. However, it is discovered that this was simply one of many alien clones of Samantha. With the help of X, Mulder pursues the Bounty Hunter to a submarine in the Arctic. Mulder is nearly killed when exposed to the Bounty Hunter's toxic blood, but is saved by Scully. When a hacker downloads decades' worth of classified information about aliens onto a digital tape, he gives it to Mulder, who finds that the entire tape is written in Navajo. Cigarette Smoking Man begins searching for the tape and visits Mulder's father, who calls Mulder to see him shortly afterwards. Before he can reveal anything to Mulder, however, he is murdered by Alex Krycek. Scully brings Mulder to New Mexico, where she introduces him to Albert Hosteen, a code talker who can translate the digital tape. Albert's grandson shows Mulder a boxcar filled with alien corpses. Cigarette Smoking Man tracks Mulder's location, however, and orders the boxcar burned. The season premiere was originally supposed to have been written by series creator Chris Carter. In his initial pitch, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. In fact, the producers wanted to film the episode in Russia, but they were not able to secure the appropriate arrangements. In the end, Carter was unable to complete the script idea, which would have also featured the reopening of the X Files. Instead, co executive producers Glen Morgan, James Wong and Howard Gordon penned the opening premiere, Little Green Men the episode was the first entry to actually show an alien in the series. This delay gave Carter time to write Duane Barry , the start of the series' first two parter. As the series ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers the pregnancy of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully giving birth to an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as the best thing that ever happened to the series as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X Files at the end of the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing . The two parter of Carter's Duane Barry and Paul Brown's Ascension were scripted to culminate in Scully's abduction and the re opening of the X Files. Anderson does not feature at all in the following episode 3 , as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time of filming. The season introduced the character X, played by Steven Williams, who replaced Deep Throat as Mulder's informant, following Deep Throat's assassination in the first season finale, The Erlenmeyer Flask . X was originally intended to be a woman with Natalija Nogulich already cast in the role, but was replaced by Williams as the writers did not believe she had the right chemistry with her co stars. X was written to be different than Deep Throat Deep Throat had been selfless, while X was intended to be selfish and scared. Nicholas Lea, who had previously appeared in a small part in the season one's Gender Bender , was cast as Alex Krycek. Krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for Scully when she was abducted, but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on the show. During the production of the season, Duchovny asked Carter wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotniz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two part episodes Colony and End Game . Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very distinctive look about him, most notably his face and mouth. Megan Leitch also appeared in Colony and End Game as a grown up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and would return to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been straight science fiction and it was too ridiculous to give too many answers. Darren McGavin, star of Kolchak The Night Stalker, was sought out for the part of Senator Matheson in Little Green Men and Mulder's father in Colony and End Game , but the roles went to Raymond J. Barry and Peter Donat respectively, while McGavin agreed to play X Files founder Arthur Dales in season five. Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote seven episodes. Co executive producers and writing team Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote five episodes for their final season as regular writers for the series, although they would both return as consulting producers for part of season four. Supervising producer Howard Gordon wrote five episodes. Frank Spotnitz joined the series, writing two episodes. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Carter for two episodes receiving story credit. Glen Morgan's younger brother Darin Morgan joined the series, contributing the story for an episode written by his older brother and James Wong, and writing another script solo. Paul Brown joined the series as a producer and wrote two episodes. Sara B. Charno, another staff writer, wrote two episodes. Vince Gilligan joined the series, writing one episode. Former supervising producer Alex Gansa returned to co wrote one episode with writing partner Howard Gordon. Chris Ruppenthal returned to write one more freelance episode after last season. Steve De Jarnatt also contributed one freelance episode for the season. Line producer and production manager Joseph Patrick Finn was promoted to producer with this season. Paul Rabwin continued to serve as co producer for the show. Producing directors for the show included Rob Bowman, David Nutter, Kim Manners and co executive producer R. W. Goodwin, who all directed the most of the season Bowman with seven, Nutter with five, and Manners and Goodwin each with two. Series creator Chris Carter directed one episode, making his directorial debut, while Daniel Sackheim, Michael Lange, James Contner, James Whitmore, Jr., Michael Vejar, Nick Marck, Stephen Surjik and Win Phelps each directed one episode. a She does not appear in 3 .

Pivotal characters such as the First Elder Don S. Williams and the alien virus black oil were first introduced in this season. In addition, the season features a wide variety of Monster of the Week episodes, stand alone stories not of influence to the wider mythology of the series.

Season premiere The Blessing Way debuted with a Nielsen household rating of 19.94, which more than doubled the premiere of the last season. The ratings consistently stayed above 15.0, making it one of the most watched series of the 199596 television line up. The season received generally positive reviews from television critics, winning five Primetime Emmy Awards. Many of the episodes written by writer Darin Morgan received critical acclaim, including the episodes Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose and Jose Chung's From Outer Space which are often cited as some of the best of the series. Morgan left the series following this season, due to an inability to keep up with the fast paced nature of the show. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. Mulder is later found in the desert following the events of the second season finale and nursed back to health by Albert Hosteen Floyd Red Crow Westerman . Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien human hybrids. Her sister Melissa Melinda McGraw , however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night. Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, Mulder infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien human hybrid. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X Steven Williams . X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by the agent's partner Dana Scully Gillian Anderson . Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder Don S. Williams , who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists. The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War II era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burnsexcept for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has overtaken Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , whom Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister. Development of the first episode of the season, The Blessing Way , began with the second season finale Anasazi . Both of those episodes, along with Paper Clip , form a three part trilogy of episodes that began the third season. Anasazi was directed by R. W. Goodwin, who later directed the season finale Talitha Cumi , and Paper Clip was directed by Rob Bowman. Bowman directed a total of eight episodes for the season, followed by Kim Manners who directed seven. Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote eight episodes, directing one. Darin Morgan had a small involvement in the second season, and was asked to contribute more content for the third. He first appeared in The Host as the Flukeman, and was brought on by his brother Glen Morgan to help write the episode Blood . Morgan's first sole credit as a writer came in the episode Humbug , which received a positive reception by the staff. David Duchovny expressed an enjoyment for working with Morgan, commenting what I loved about his scripts was that he seemed to be trying to destroy the show. Morgan wrote a total of three episodes, but later left the series because he could not keep up with the fast paced nature of network television. He also expressed a negative opinion of the way his teleplays were handled, despite a positive reception by both critics and the crew of his work. He also contributed to the script for the episode Quagmire . After writing one episode the previous season, Vince Gilligan returned to write another solo episode for the season, now credited as a creative consultant. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Howard Gordon and Chris Carter for two episodes receiving story credit. New writers in the third season included story editor Jeffrey Vlaming who wrote two episodes, supervising producer Charles Grant Craig who wrote a single episode, Kim Newtown who wrote two episodes, and staff writer John Shiban who wrote two episodes. All new writers except Shiban did not return after this season. Series visual effects producer Mat Beck also wrote an episode. Other producers included production manager and producer Joseph Patrick Finn and co producer Paul Rabwin. Nisei and 731 , show a darker side to the series, exploring the public's distrust in the government. Other episodes dealing with the wider mythology of the series Talitha Cumi , Piper Maru and Apocrypha explore similar concepts, showcasing the shadow government plot line of the series. Episodes like 2Shy and Pusher feature sadistic villains, containing human beings capable of highly immoral acts despite their seemingly mundane appearances. Another episode with a serial killer antagonist, Grotesque , revolves around the way that evil can change and influence people. Oubliette offers a sentimental and emotional plot driven by the kidnapping of a young girl. The episode features parallels to the real life Polly Klaas case and provides commentary on both stockholm syndrome and trauma. Aliens and serial killers are not the only antagonists in the season several episodes revolve around more traditional, B movie inspired monsters, taking influence from horror films. These episodes include War of the Coprophages and Quagmire , about killer cockroaches and a lake monster. Several episodes have satirical elements, including D.P.O. , Syzygy and War of the Coprophages , with the latter two showcasing how the public can create panic out of need. Both Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose and Jose Chung's From Outer Space play against tropes and the established formula of the series, subverting themes the series usually followed. Episodes marked with a double dagger are episodes in the series' Alien Mythology arc. The third season of The X Files debuted with The Blessing Way on September 22, 1995.

The episode was viewed by 19.94 million viewers. The Blessing Way was, at the time, the highest rated episode of The X Files to air the previous record belonged to the season two entry Fresh Bones , which only scored an 11.3 rating with a 19 share. As the season continued, however, ratings dropped slightly and stabilized. After the season premiere, the highest rated episode of the season was the finale, Talitha Cumi , which was viewed by 17.86 million viewers. The season hit a low with the twenty third and penultimate episode of the season, Wetwired , which was viewed by only 14.48 million viewers.

The third season of the show was the last to be aired on Friday nights for its fourth season, the show was moved to Sunday. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the third season The X Files' best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time , noting it was consistent and from strength to strength between mythology and stand alone episodes. However, she thought it starts out kind of terribly with The Blessing Way . Zack Handlen, VanDerWerff's colleague, wrote that the third season was one of the show's strongest, with the conspiracy arc still keeping tension high instead of just vamping for time. By this point, the sometimes awkward effects work of the early years is gone, and the overall direction is highly polished, giving even the season's weakest entries a cinematic feel . He also stated that Morgan's Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose and Jose Chung's From Outer Space were The X Files's two greatest hours . The writing credits provided by Morgan was widely cited as a highlight of the season. War of the Coprophages written by him received positive reviews, and Entertainment Weekly gave War of the Coprophages an A, who praised the absurdity and entertainment value of the episode. Another episode, Quagmire containing some writing credits by Morgan received positive reviews, with the 10 minute dialogue sequence featuring Mulder and Scully receiving highly positive reviews. Gilligan's episode Pusher was also cited as one of the best episodes of the series by both IGN and Den of Geek, and Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 69 of the X Files, named the episode the third best episode of The X Files and called it the best MOTW monster of the week in the series history Duchovny considers his performance in Oubliette as his favorite of the season, an episode that also received mostly positive reviews. Writing for DVD Talk, Earl Cressey rated the season overall four and a half stars out of five, finding that the series' increased budget meant that its production values and the quality of its guest appearances were better than previous seasons. The third season earned the series eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It received its second consecutive nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, Gillian Anderson received her first nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and the episode Jose Chung's From Outer Space was nominated for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Art Direction for a Series. The series won five awards, including Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Drama Series, for the episode Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose written by Darin Morgan Peter Boyle won for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in that same episode.

"The fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on October 4, 1996, concluding on the same channel on May 18, 1997, and contained 24 episodes. Following the filming and airing of the season, production began on The X Files feature film, which was released in 1998 following the show's fifth season. The fourth season of the series focuses heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder's David Duchovny and his partner Dana Scully's Gillian Anderson investigation of an alien conspiracy, which is protected by the mysterious Syndicate. Midway through the season, Scully is diagnosed with terminal cancer, a result of her previous abduction, and Mulder begins to lose his faith in the idea of extraterrestrials. Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twentieth most watched television series during the 199697 television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it, at the time, the highest rated season of The X Files to air. The season's twelfth episode, Leonard Betts was chosen as the Fox lead out program following Super Bowl XXXI, and was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, making it the highest rated episode in the series' run. Critical reception from television critics was mostly positive. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. When the Syndicate suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's Steven Williams role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to MulderMarita Covarrubias Laurie Holden , the Special Representative to the Secretary General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea is working with the Russians. Having been diagnosed with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction Ascension , and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , who secretly makes such a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI. The season saw drastic changes to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, Herrenvolk , Williamsthe actor who played Mulder's informant Xwas written out of the show. He said that, Carter called me up personally 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet. The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman , noting that he wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. Herrenvolk also introduced the killer bees, who would go on to play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show. The season is notable in that it introduced a story arc about Scully developing terminal cancer, which would not be resolved until the beginning of the fifth season. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as a cheap TV thing . However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an obligatory move to have Scully follow suit. Following the cancellation of the Fox television series Space Above and Beyond, Carter called the series' creators Glen Morgan and Wongwho had previously been writers for the first two seasons of The X Filesand asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter that the two of them would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members from the cast of Space Above and Beyond, so that the world can finally see them . Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes. The season finale, Gethsemane , was notable in that an entire set created to emulated icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage and required the use of truckloads of lumber and 10,000 square feet 930 m2 of Styrofoam. The set would become one of the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history. The set required a constant temperature of 21 F 29 C in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to have a place that feels real to aid their acting. The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather conditions making shooting difficult enough to require an extra day of work. Although the series' 1998 movie would take place after the events of the fifth season, the movie was actually filmed in the hiatus between the show's fourth and fifth season and re shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season. Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote eight episodes. Howard Gordon continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes for his final season on the series. Spotnitz was promoted to co producer and wrote seven episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to co producer and wrote five episodes. Former X Files writers Glen Morgan and James Wong returned after a one season absence from the series as consulting producers and wrote three episodes together, with Morgan writing an additional episode solo that Wong directed. John Shiban was promoted to story editor and wrote four episodes. David Greenwalt joined mid season as co executive producer and wrote one episode for his only season on the series. Writing team Valerie and Vivian Mayhew wrote one freelance episode. Executive producer and frequent series director R. W. Goodwin wrote his first and only episode for the series. Other producers included producer Joseph Patrick Finn, co producer Paul Rabwin, and consulting producer Ken Horton, who joined the series with this season. Producing directors for the show included Rob Bowman and Kim Manners, who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Manners directed eight episodes, while Bowman directed seven. Executive producer R. W. Goodwin again directed the season premiere and finale. James Charleston directed three episodes, while Tucker Gates, Michael Lange, Cliff Bole, and series writer James Wong each directed one episode. a She does not appear in Zero Sum .

The fourth season of The X Files received largely positive reviews from television critics, although several critics noted that the season was not as good as its predecessors. The Contra Costa Times noted that The X Files during its fourth year was creatively good and always fascinating even when it's frustrating. Rick Kushman Bee of the Sacramento Bee wrote that Fox' Sunday block of The Simpsons, King of the Hill and The X Files was televisions real 'Must See TV' . Matt Roush of USA Today wrote that the fourth season was not the series' best year, but when good, The X Files is still shockingly great . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave an overall positive review of the season and wrote that many of the episodes dabbled in existentialism. However, he also contended that many of the mythology episodesespecially the season finalebegan to have a ring of familiarity to them and that the repetition is getting old . Episodic reviews were diverse. Some episodes were praised. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe A Critical Guide to The X Files, Millennium The Lone Gunmen, rated the episodes Home , Unruhe , Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man , Paper Hearts , and Small Potatoes five stars out of five. Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique also awarded Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man , Paper Hearts , and Small Potatoes perfect scores of four out of four. Tom Kessenich named Memento Mori the fourth best episode of the series, writing that it was the definitive example of Mulder and Scully's devotion for each other. . He also wrote highly of Home , Paper Hearts , Small Potatoes , and Never Again , ranking them as the fifth, eleventh, sixteenth, and twenty fourth best episodes of The X Files, respectively. Other episodes were derided. Shearman and Pearson called El Mundo Gira an aching unambitious take on Latin American culture and rubbish . Vitaris summaried Unrequited as a slight story that collapses under the weight of its message . Gethsemane created intense media speculation about whether or not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's death . Series creator Chris Carter noted that the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it's an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him . UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of TV's Best Season Finales , noting that it rocked the core of the series' entire mythology . The fourth season earned the series twelve Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with three wins. Anderson won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, after being nominated the previous year.

In addition, this was the first season of the show where the course of the story was planned, due to the 1998 The X Files feature film being filmed before it, but scheduled to be released after it aired. The fifth season of the series focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder's David Duchovny loss of faith in the existence of extraterrestrials and his partner, Dana Scully's Gillian Anderson , resurgence of health following her bout with cancer. New characters were also introduced, including agents Jeffrey Spender Chris Owens and Diana Fowley Mimi Rogers and the psychic Gibson Praise Jeff Gulka . The finale, The End , led up to both the 1998 film and the sixth season premiere The Beginning . Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the eleventh most watched television series during the 199798 television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it the year's highest rated Fox program as well as the highest rated season of The X Files to air. Critical reception from television critics was generally positive. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. At the end of the fourth season, Scully is dying of cancer. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. In the fifth season opener Redux , he uses the distraction to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI. Due to the information he learns from Michael Kritschgau John Finn , Mulder loses his belief in extraterrestrials.

Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X Files they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise Jeff Gulka . Due to the pending release of The X Files feature film, this was the first season where the course of the season was planned in advance, as it had to set up for the film. Originally, the season was supposed to be the show's last. In this manner, the finale was originally supposed to have segued the television series into a movie franchise. David Duchovny explained, we were saying, 'Okay, we're going to do five. We'll get out of here at five.' And then five came around, and no one was going anywhere. The series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the season was created in a way to segue into the 1998 film, as well as the sixth season premiere, The Beginning . Due to the necessity of filming reshoots for the upcoming movie, both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are absent in places throughout the season. For instance, the episodes Unusual Suspects and Travelers both of which being flashback episodesdo not feature Anderson's character Dana Scully at all. In fact, the former was written entirely as a stop gap episode when the show's producers were forced to start production of the fifth season in the last week of August in Vancouver, but still needed series stars Duchovny and Anderson for the filming of The X Files movie in Los Angeles. The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen, and writing duties were assigned to Vince Gilligan. Other episodes such as Chinga and Christmas Carol feature minimal appearances by Duchovny's character Fox Mulder. The season's fifth episode, The Post Modern Prometheus , written and directed by Carter, was filmed entirely in black and whitein homage to James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. The director of photography, Joel Ransom, had to spend longer than usual lighting each scene because of the grayscale. The stormy skies in the episode, added to emulate the atmosphere of old Frankenstein movies, were a visual effect. Carter also used a wide angle camera lens throughout the episode, which forced the actors to act directly to the camera, rather than to each other. According to Carter, it also enabled him to give scenes in the episode a more surreal staging than was usual for the show. This season finale, The End , was the last episode of the series to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada prior to production moving to Los Angeles, although the second film in the franchise, The X Files I Want to Believe, released in 2008, was once more filmed in Vancouver. The move was influenced in part by Duchovny, who after five years of filming wanted to be closer to his wife. The audience at the chess match was made up of local fans as a thank you to the city for hosting the production during its first five years. The chess match was filmed at Rogers Arena then known as GM Placethe home of the Vancouver Canucks as well as the Vancouver Grizzlies at the time. While the producers expected five thousand people to show up, twelve thousand appeared. Instructions were given to the crowd by director R. W. Goodwin using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard. During breaks between shooting concession stands, music and videos were made available to the attendees.

"The sixth season of the science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 8, 1998, concluding on the same channel on May 16, 1999, and consisted of twenty two episodes. The season continued on from the 1998 feature film and focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully's Gillian Anderson separation from the X Files Division and the demise of the Syndicatea shadow government group attempting to cover up the existence of extraterrestrialsin the two part episode Two Fathers and One Son . The season was the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after production was moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This move was done largely at the behest of Duchovny, who wished to be closer to his wife, Tea Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, although series director Kim Manners and Anderson approved of it, although to a less vocal degree than Duchovny. The first half of the season also saw Mimi Rogers and Chris Owens' charactersDiana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender, respectivelybecome recurring characters. Despite debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twelfth most watched television series during the 199899 television year, the season saw a slight decrease in ratings from the previous one, a trend that would continue until its final year. The season received mixed to positive reviews from television critics some critics and fans were alienated by the show, due to the different tone taken by most standalone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the previous style of monsters of the week , they were often romantic, humorous, or a combination of both. In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica. Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi tells Mulder that he and Scully have been denied reassignment to the division. Mulder goes to his former basement office, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender Chris Owens and Diana Fowley Mimi Rogers have been assigned to the X Files. Going against orders, Mulder and Scully track down an escaped alien in Phoenix, Arizona while Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis gives chase. Mulder and Scully eventually discover that Cigarette Smoking Man has been using Gibson Praise to locate the creature. Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood. Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra Spender Veronica Cartwright , an alien abductee and mother of Jeffrey Spender. Skinner takes Spender to the scene, where Cassandra asks for Mulder. She informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth. She claims that a rebel force of aliens are mutilating their faces to prevent infection by the black oil. Cigarette Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Cassandra later escapes from a hospital and arrives at Mulder's apartment, demanding that he shoot her because she is the embodiment of fifty years of work by the Syndicatean alien human hybrid that will trigger colonization if the aliens learn of her existence. Fowley arrives and forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a CDC facility at Fort Marlene. There, Mulder runs into Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden . Marita tells Mulder that she was subjected to Syndicate run black oil vaccine tests. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a checkpoint, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra Cigarette Smoking Man and Fowley escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by Cigarette Smoking Man. Several months later, a metallic artifact with inscriptions is discovered on the beach of Cote d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks Bill Dow tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach. After five successful seasons of The X Files, series creator Chris Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film the 1998 X Files movie. The film grossed US 83,898,313 in the US and 105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of 189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned 30,138,758 which was 35.9 of its total gross. Initially, the fifth season of The X Files was supposed to be the show's last. However, the series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the sixth season of the show began filming. After five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, production of The X Files moved to Los Angeles. The Beginning was the first episode of the series to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. The move was instigated by David Duchovny, who portrayed Mulder, in order to increase his opportunity to find movie work as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife, Tea Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move others, like series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move but were less vocal than Duchovny. Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California. According to Andy Meisler, The very first shot of the season, a long look directly into a bright sun shining on a barren desert, was designed to boldly announce the show's arrival in Southern California. As a result of the move, the episode featured a largely new group of crew members, hired by Carter, Frank Spotnitz and new co executive producer Michael Watkins this necessitated the show's new crewmembers spending five weeks, receiving, unpacking, and cataloging filming material from their Vancouver counterparts. Because of the shift from Vancouver to Los Angeles, some fans of the series were alienated. Many accused the show of Hollywood izing the series by adding notable guest stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for larger audiences. According to Space.com, a number of fans of the show specifically loved the moody ambiance filming around Vancouver lent the series , which the sixth season reportedly lacked. The move to Los Angeles also meant a drastic price increase for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, At the time, the exchange rate between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody told me that the cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved . In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. ... It became apparent very quickly to me that we were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding in the middle of the woods . Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote five episodes. Spotnitz was promoted to executive producer and wrote five episodes, and wrote the story for a further two episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to co executive producer and wrote seven episodes. John Shiban was promoted to producer and wrote six episodes, and wrote the story for one other episode. New writers in the sixth season included David Amann who joined as executive story editor and wrote two episodes, and Jeffrey Bell who also wrote two episodes. Freelance episodes were written by Daniel Arkin and Jim Guttridge, and a further episode was written by Ken Hawryliw, who was the series' property master from 1993 to 1998. Duchovny also wrote his first episode solo, as he previously collaborated with various writers, including Chris Carter, on three other episodes. Other producers included producer Paul Rabwin, co producer Lori Jo Nemhauser, and Bernadette Caulfield who joined as producer. Producing directors for the show included producer Rob Bowman, producer Manners, co executive producer Michael Watkins, and consulting producer Daniel Sackheim, who together directed the bulk of the season's episodes. Manners directed seven episodes, Bowman directed six, Watkins directed three, and Sackheim directed one. Series creator Chris Carter directed two episodes, while cast member David Duchovny directed his first episode of the series. The remaining two episodes were directed by Peter Markle and Bryan Spicer. a Duchovny only contributes his voice to Three of a Kind .

The episode was viewed by 20.34 million people, a marked increase from the fifth season's finale, The End , which was viewed by 18.76 million viewers. However, the debut marked a drastic decrease from the fifth season debut, Redux , which garnered 27.34 million viewers. As the season continued, ratings continued to drop.

The season ranked as the twelfth most watched television series during the 19981999 season, with an average of 16.39 million viewers. The season received positive reviews from television critics. However some fans were alienated by the show in its sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the previous style of monsters of the week , they were often romantic, humorous, or a combination of both. Several episodes Dreamland and The Rain King in particularwere criticized for their reliance on humor or for their lighter stories. Fans on the internet began calling the less scary episodes X Files Lite . Other episodes were derided for their mediocrity. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique called the episode Alpha a run of the mill monster of the week episode . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe A Critical Guide to The X Files, Millennium The Lone Gunmen, called the episode Trevor The X Files at its most generic . However, not all the sixth season episodes were poorly received. The season's third episode, Triangle was largely lauded as a masterpiece by critics. The episode, which was shot in real time to look like it was filmed in four uninterrupted eleven minute takes, was called a classic standalone episode and one of the highlights of season six . The Two Fathers One Son story arc, which featured the destruction of the Syndicate, was called one of the most coherent, ... almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run by one critic. Finally, the Duchovny penned The Unnatural , which featured the story of an alien who fell in love with baseball, was praised by critics for its plot, directing, and originality. One review praised Duchovny's directing excellence while another referred to its ending as heartbreaking . The sixth season earned the series eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with one win. It won for Outstanding Makeup for a Series for the episodes Two Fathers and One Son .

"The seventh season of the American science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999, concluded on May 21, 2000, and consists of twenty two episodes. Taking place after the destruction of the Syndicate, this season marks the end of various other story lines during this season, Fox Mulder David Duchovny learned the true fate of his sister, Samantha. The season concludes with Mulder being abducted by aliens and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson learning that she is pregnant with his child. Before the broadcasting for the season began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his decision to leave the show. As a result, the season would be the last to feature Duchovny in a full time capacity until the show's tenth season which aired in 2016 , although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. Due to this eventual character change, this season would be the last to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the two later years updated the intro in an attempt to renew and revive the series. The seventh season premiere The Sixth Extinction , debuted with a Nielsen rating of 10.6 and was viewed by 17.82 million viewers, marking a noticeable drop in viewership since the sixth season. The series fell from number 12 to number 29 for the 19992000 television year. Critically, the show's seventh season received mixed to positive reviews many reviewers felt that the show still produced good episodes, but that it was the weakest of the Duchovny and Anderson seasons of the show. After the events of the season six finale, Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi and Michael Kritschgau John Finn are desperately attempting to find the truth behind the so called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder David Duchovny is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully Gillian Anderson and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's Mimi Rogers duplicityshe is working for Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis . Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Cote d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man. While investigating a bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder becomes obsessed with the number of children who have vanished in similar circumstances. Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister's disappearance. At the same time it is revealed to him that his mother, Teena Mulder Rebecca Toolan , committed suicide. He then tries to prove that his mother did not take her own life, but is ultimately forced to accept that his mother's death was by her own hand. He is led by a man whose son disappeared years earlier to another truththat his sister may be among the souls taken by walk ins , saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. Together they locate evidence that proves that Samantha was abducted by Cigarette Smoking Man and was forced to live in a now abandoned US Army base. It is later revealed that Samantha had become a walk in spirit. Mulder and Scully investigate a case which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together. With a series of Alien abductions taking place, Mulder and Scully are contacted by Billy Miles Zachary Ansley . Scully falls ill during the investigation and returns to Washington, D.C. Cigarette Smoking Man contacts Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden and Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , in an attempt to revive the government conspiracy. With Covarrubias unwilling to assist, and Krycek seeking revenge, they contact Mulder after he visits an alien crash site. Skinner and Mulder return to Oregon, while Scully is hospitalized in Washington, D.C. Mulder becomes trapped by an alien device, and is abducted by an Alien Bounty Hunter Brian Thompson together with Miles and several others. Skinner returns to Washington, D.C. where Scully informs him that she is pregnant, though she does not tell him that Mulder is the father. After five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, production of The X Files moved to Los Angeles. The X Files' sixth season was the first season of the show to be filmed in the new location. The move was instigated by Duchovny in order to facilitate his work in films as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife, Tea Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California. Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew, both series director Kim Manners and Anderson supported the move, although less vocally than Duchovny. Many fans accused the show of Hollywood izing by adding notable guests stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for mass audiences. Furthermore, the move to Los Angeles also meant a drastic increase in production costs. Originally, the mythology for season seven was supposed to continue from and show the ramifications of the Two Fathers One Son story arc. Frank Spotnitz, in an interview, explained that the mythology episodes for season seven would feature characters you saw in 'One Son' coming back and explore what happens now that the conspiracy has been destroyed, what are the politics of the new landscape that exists. ... There are aliens from outer space, two different races that are warring with each other. In addition, he said that the then planned series finale would feature the big idea that Chris had in the beginning. However, these ideas never came to pass, and the season finale, Requiem , segued directly into the eighth season premiere Within . Duchovny later revealed that, had the show ended, the final three episodes would have been devoted to the myth arc. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day. Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, Millennium was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, Closure , features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away. As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, we found ourselves starting to get energized again. ... As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful. The season also saw several of the show's cast write their own episodes. Series co star Gillian Anderson directed and wrote her first episode of the series, all things . Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a deeply personal X File, one which in is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her . Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote a majority of the story in one sitting. She explained, A certain concept began to form, I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' right then and there. It all just kind of came together on the page . The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the personal and quiet characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, En Ami . Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the En Ami as the creepiest episode of the year. Before the season aired, David Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox. Duchovny claimed that Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Originally, in the contract, Duchovny was eligible for an estimated five percent, but, according to him, he had seen only a fraction of the money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about 20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Although his lawsuit never called Chris Carter a defendant, their friendship was notably impacted. One anonymous source noted that the whole lawsuit thing revealed that Carter knew Duchovny was getting screwed and didn't warn him. Carter proved where his loyalties lay with his actions. Neither Carter nor Duchovny were contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of Requiem , Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor. Rumors began spreadingand were eventually confirmedthat, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role Pileggi later called this guess ridiculous. Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote six episodes. Spotnitz continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes. Vince Gilligan continued as co executive producer and wrote six episodes. John Shiban was promoted to supervising producer and wrote two episodes. David Amann was promoted to co producer and wrote two episodes. Jeffrey Bell was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. Cyberpunk novelists William Gibson and Tom Maddox returned to write their second of two episodes for the series. Cast member Duchovny wrote two episodes in the season, while other cast members Anderson and Davis also wrote an episode each. New writers in the seventh season included Steven Maeda and Greg Walker, who wrote one episode and Chip Johannessen who wrote a single freelance episode. Other producers included Paul Rabwin and Bernadette Caulfield, and Michelle MacLaren who joined as co executive producer. Producing directors for the show included producer Rob Bowman, supervising producer Manners, and co executive producer Michael Watkins, who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Bowman directed two episodes for his final season on the series, Manners directed seven, and Watkins directed three. Cast members David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson each directed one episode. Series creator Chris Carter directed a single episode, while series writer Vince Gilligan made his television directorial debut. Other directors for the season included Thomas J. Wright who directed three episodes, with Robert Lieberman, Cliff Bole, and Paul Shapiro each directing one. Episodes marked with a double dagger are episodes in the series' Alien Mythology arc. The seventh season of The X Files debuted with The Sixth Extinction on November 7, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.6, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.6 percent of all television equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned into the episode. The episode was viewed by 17.82 million people, an increase from the sixth season's finale, Biogenesis , which was viewed by 15.86 million viewers. However, the debut marked a decrease from the sixth season debut, The Beginning , which garnered 20.34 million viewers. As the season continued, however, ratings began to drop. The season hit a low with the eighteenth episode, Brand X , which was viewed by 10.81 million viewers. The season finale, Requiem , earned a Nielsen rating of 8.9, with a 14 share, and was viewed by 15.26 million viewers, marking a 14 percent drop in viewers when compared to the season premiere, and a 4 percent drop in viewers when compared to the previous season finale. The series was ranked at number 29 during the 19992000 television season, finishing with an average of 14.2 million viewers. During 2000, companies were paying Fox 225,000 for every 30 second spot that would air between acts of The X Files. Many Information technology IT companies were buying commercials during the show, largely due to the fact that many 'coders IT geeks' get their weekly fix of science fiction from this prime time show. The seventh season received moderately positive reviews from critics, although increasingly critical reviews were more common this season. While critics enjoyed many of the episodes, many also felt that, as a whole, the season was the weakest of the show's original seven. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News praised the season, noting that it was proof that The X Files still has more than enough creative life in it to justify an eighth season . He called many of the stand alone episodes wonderfully creepy and noted that the season possessed a terrific bunch of episodes . Thomas Doherty from Cinefantastique gave the season a mixed review and noted that the series was hurt by the partnership between Mulder and Scully settl into the comfortable groove of a modern two career marriagesupportive, professionally rewarding, and utterly sexless. Further, he noted that the most entertaining episode lately have been the self parodies, where killer cockroaches scurry and living dead roam, or where in the Duchovny written and directed episode Scully and Mulder are played by Tea Leoni and Garry Shandling in a motion picture only slightly more ludicrous than a 1998 motion picture called The X Files. Doherty argued that the self parody style of the series caused viewers to not take it seriously anymore, explaining that, No longer going for the big chill, Carter and company are winking at their audience, as if to say even we can't pretend to believe in this muddled mishmash anymore. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 69 of the X Files, was positive towards the first half of the season, but soon saw the episodes in more of a negative light. He wrote, A season that began with such hope ended with a sense of sorrow given the end result of the season long backstage wheeling and dealing a reference to David Duchovny's lawsuit . Not even the magnificent season finale ... could erase the nagging doubts I had that a series that had been so amazing for so long would soon embark upon a new course wrought with pitfalls and turmoil. The A.V. Club noted that while the first eight seasons of The X Files were good to great , the seventh season of the show was flagging and possessed significant problems. The episodes themselves received a variety of reviews. Some were positively received several reviews praised the episode X Cops , the show's highly promoted cross over with the police reality show COPS. One review from the New York Daily News called the outing exceptionally clever whereas Starpulse named the episode the funniest of the series. The Duchovny penned Hollywood A.D. was praised for its self reflexive comedy by several reviews. Other episodes were more harshly received. Anderson's writing debut, all things was critiqued for being dull and heavy handed . Brand X , on the other hand, was called a waste of an episode. The seventh season earned the series six Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with three wins. The episode First Person Shooter won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The episode Theef won for Outstanding Makeup for a Series. Other nominations included Mark Snow for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series Dramatic Underscore for Theef , the episode First Person Shooter for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, and Rush for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The series, as well as Gillian Anderson, won a Teen.com Entertainment Award for Best Drama Series and Best Actress in a Series, respectively. Other nominations included two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, an Environmental Media Awards nomination for Brand X , and an International Monitor Award nomination for Rush .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29
"The eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing in the United States on November 5, 2000, concluded on May 20, 2001, and consisted of twenty one episodes. Season eight takes place after Fox Mulder's David Duchovny alien abduction in the seventh season. The story arc for the search of Mulder continues until the second half of the season, while a new arc about Dana Scully's Gillian Anderson pregnancy is formed. This arc would continue, and end, with the next season. The season explores various themes such as life, death, and belief. For this season, Duchovny elected to return only as an intermittent main character, appearing in only half of the episodes. Actor Robert Patrick was hired as a replacement for Mulder, playing John Doggett. The season also marked the first appearance of Annabeth Gish as Monica Reyes, who would become a main character in the ninth season. In addition to the cast change, series creator Chris Carter updated the opening credits, which had remained unchanged since the first season. Season eight was received well by critics but was less warmly received by fans, many of whom were unhappy that Duchovny reduced his role and that Patrick took over as co lead alongside Anderson. Ratings for the season were initially strong, but it eventually averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season's 14.2 million. Concurrent with the airing of this season, Carter and The X Files production team created and aired a short lived spinoff titled The Lone Gunmen. At the end of the seventh season finale, Requiem , Fox Mulder David Duchovny was abducted by aliens. Dana Scully Gillian Anderson meets Special Agent John Doggett Robert Patrick , the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to conduct a search for Mulder. Although the search ultimately proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X Files and works with Scully to look for explanations to several cases. When Scully learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy and fears for her unborn child. Doggett introduces Scully to Special Agent Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish , an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder's deceased body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi is threatened by Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles Zachary Ansley , a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity. Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government has replaced several humans, including Miles and several high ranking FBI personnel, with so called alien Super Soldiers . Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonisation of Earth. They have learned that Scully's baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be greater than them. They have only recently learned of the baby's importance, which is why Krycek told Skinner to kill the unborn child earlier. When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after Skinner kills Krycek, Scully delivers an apparently normal baby while the alien super soldiers surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment. The eighth season of The X Files takes place in a science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy, in this case, the alien Colonists. The first episode of the season, Within explores loss , loneliness and pain after the disappearance of Mulder. Per Manum included basic themes common in the series, such as dark, foreboding terror , an overriding sense of paranoia , and the fear of the unknown , among others. Later on, death and resurrection emerged as a major sub theme during the season, starting with The Gift , wherein John Doggett is killed and resurrected, and later in Deadalive when Mulder is brought back to life after apparently being dead for three months. This sub theme would continue well into the ninth season. The main story arc of the season dealt with the idea that, at times, humanity is a greater danger to itself. This theme is made manifest by the Syndicate and the human conspiracy with the aliens. The series' original title sequence, crafted in 1993 during the show's first season had remained unchanged for seven seasons. With the partial loss of Duchovny after the seventh season finale, the decision was made to update the credits, which were first featured in the premiere episode of season eight, Within . The opening sequence now included new images, updated FBI badge photos for Duchovny and Anderson, and the addition of Patrick to the main cast. Duchovny's badge features in the opening credits only when he appears in an episode. The opening contains images of Scully's pregnancy and, according to Frank Spotnitz, shows an abstract explanation for Mulder's absence in this season, with him falling into an eye. After the partial departure of Duchovny, Carter decided to focus almost solely on the character of Doggett during the first half of the season. This led to some unhappiness from the cast and critics, most notably Duchovny and Anderson. According to Tom Kessenich in his book Examinations, Anderson reportedly wasn't thrilled with the lack of attention her character was getting instead, the writers were crafting episodes solely for Doggett because he was the show's new voice . Duchovny, on the other hand, was unhappy because Mulder's abduction was never properly examined. Reportedly, Duchovny offered to write and direct an episode based around the concept of Mulder being trapped in the alien spaceship, as seen in the season opener Within and Without . Carter, however, nixed the idea because it was not about Doggett. The show's seventh season was a time of closure for The X Files. Characters within the show were written outincluding Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis and Mulder's mother Rebecca Toolan and several plot threads were resolved, including the fate of Fox Mulder's sister Samantha. Furthermore, after settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit the show. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, and Carter penned Requiem , the finale episode of the seventh season, as a possible series finale. However, at the last minute, a new season was ordered and Duchovny agreed to star part time, returning for 12 episodes instead of 21. Due to this change, the producers found it difficult to write Duchovny's character out of the script, but also eventually explain Mulder's absence if there were to be an upcoming season. Eventually, it was decided to have the character abducted by aliens. Hoping to continue the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder John Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell who played Wayne Weinsider in a previous episode of The X Files were considered for the role, but the producers eventually choose Robert Patrick. The season also introduced Monica Reyes portrayed by Annabeth Gish , who would become a main character in the following season. Chris Carter, who also served as executive producer and showrunner during the season, wrote or co wrote the bulk of the episodes for the season, with nine of the twenty one episodes. Of the nine, four were co written with executive producer Frank Spotnitz. Carter also wrote five episodes solo, and Spotnitz wrote four episodes solo. The rest of the writing staff contributed one or two episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to executive producer and wrote one episode. John Shiban was promoted to co executive producer and wrote one episode. David Amann was promoted to producer and wrote one episode. Jeffrey Bell was promoted to executive story editor and wrote one episode. Greg Walker was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. Steven Maeda was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. Daniel Arkin, who wrote a freelance episode for the series previously, returned to contribute to the story for one episode. Kim Manners was promoted to co executive producer and directed the most of episodes of the season with seven. Directors who directed multiple episodes for the season included Tony Wharmby who directed four, Rod Hardy directed three, and Richard Compton directed two. Peter Markle, Terrence O'Hara, and Barry K. Thomas each directed one episode. Carter directed a single episode, while writer Spotnitz made his directorial debut. a Although appearing in only 12 episodes, Duchovny is credited as starring in the opening credits for the episodes in which he appeared. b Does not appear in The Gift , except in archived footage. Episodes marked with a double dagger are episodes in the series' Alien Mythology arc. Reportedly, Patrick was cast due to the hopes that his featured role in Terminator 2 Judgment Day 1991 would attract a great 18 to 35 year old male demographic to the show. Early on, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting. Within , the season's first episode, earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.5, meaning that it was seen by 9.5 of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 15.87 million viewers, which marked an 11 decrease from the seventh season opener, The Sixth Extinction. The highest rated episode of the season was This is Not Happening , which was viewed by 16.9 million viewers, making it the most watched episode of the series, in terms of viewers, since The Sixth Extinction . The season finale, Existence , earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.4, meaning that it was seen by 8.4 of the nation's estimated households. The episode was watched by 14 million viewers, overall. The nine episodes of the season that did not feature Mulder averaged only 13 million viewers, whereas the twelve episodes that did feature Mulder averaged 13.93 million viewers, almost a difference of one million. The season averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season's 14.2 million. During 2000, companies were paying Fox 225,000 for every 30 second spot that would air between acts of The X Files. Many Information technology IT companies were buying commercials during the show, largely due to the fact that many 'coders IT geeks' get their weekly fix of science fiction from this prime time show. The show's eighth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club noted that the first eight seasons of The X Files were good to great , and that the eighth season of the show was revitalized by the new 'search for Mulder' story arc. John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions gave the season a favorable review, calling it great and describing its episodes as pretty strong . Collin Polonowonski of DVD Times said that the season included more hits than misses overall but was throughout negative about the mythology episodes claiming them to be the weakest episodes in the season. Many critics eventually accepted Doggett's character. Anita Gates of The New York Times said that most fans had accepted the introduction of the character and further stated that he actually looked Like a Secret Service Agent. Carter commented on the character, saying Everybody likes Robert Patrick and the character , but further stating that the fans miss Duchovny's character, Mulder. Dave Golder of SFX called Patrick superb and noted that his entrance in the series inject a sense of pragmatism and good old fashioned plain speaking in to the show which we didn't realise was missing until we got it. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said that Patrick's portrayal of Doggett was hardboiled alertness , giving mostly positive reviews about his inclusion. Cynthia Littleton of The Hollywood Reporter described the season as the show's swan song . Not all reviews were positive. Jesse Hassenger from PopMatters gave a negative review to the season, claiming that Patrick was mis cast and calling David Duchovny's appearances as Fox Mulder shallow. Golder criticized the season for recycling plots with gusto and for featuring Mulder falling into Scully's eye in the opening credits, noting that it gives Duchovny too much of a lingering presence on the show, reinforcing prejudices against Patrick as some kind of 'imposter'. This Is Not Happening was nominated for an American Society of Cinematographers award for cinematography. Robert Patrick won a Saturn Award in the category Best Television Actor in 2001 for his role as Doggett, that year Gillian Anderson was nominated in the category Best Actress on Television and the series itself was nominated in the category Best Network Television Series in the Saturn Awards, but failed to win. Anderson was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award the very same year in the category Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series . The X Files won its last Emmy Award with Deadalive , and Bill Roe received a nomination for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29
"The ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X Files commenced airing in the United States on November 11, 2001, concluded on May 19, 2002, and consists of twenty episodes. The season takes place after Fox Mulder David Duchovny goes into hiding, following the events of the eighth season finale, Existence . As such, the main storyarc for the season follows Dana Scully Gillian Anderson , John Doggett Robert Patrick , and Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish on their hunt to reveal a government conspiracy involving the elaborate and malevolent creation of the Super Soldiers . For this season, former series' leads Duchovny and Anderson scaled back their involvement with the show, with Duchovny only starring in the two episodes that formed the season finale, The Truth . Doggett and Reyes became the show's central characters, and former recurring character Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi became a main character. Series creator Chris Carter had hopes that the show could continue on with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned again. Season nine received mixed reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long time fans and viewers, partially because Duchovny did not make regular appearances on the show, after fulfilling his contract in the previous season. During this year, ratings for the season fell dramatically. Critics blamed it on what they considered an increasingly incoherent story arc, whilst the cast and crew ascribed the drop in viewership to the September 11 attacks. Regardless, Fox eventually decided to cancel the series. During the airing of season eight, Carter and The X Files production team had created and aired a spinoff titled The Lone Gunmen. The show was unsuccessful and was canceled before any story arcs were resolved, but The X Files episode Jump the Shark was written to give closure to the series. The X Files storyline was continued with the 2008 theatrical film The X Files I Want to Believe and later with a tenth season in 2016 and an eleventh season in 2018. After the eighth season finale Existence , Fox Mulder David Duchovny goes into hiding. Dana Scully Gillian Anderson is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish becomes John Doggett's Robert Patrick new FBI partner in the X Files office. Doggett asks Scully for help on a case involving an EPA official, Carl Wormus Nicholas Walker , who died after his car was forced off a bridge by a woman he picked up. Doggett and Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi travel to a reclamation plant, looking for links between Wormus' work and death. After doing an illegal autopsy on Wormus, Alvin Kersh James Pickens, Jr. sends Brad Follmer Cary Elwes to locate Doggett. The investigation at the reclamation plant leads to an unknown woman, whose identity is later revealed to be Shannon McMahon Lucy Lawless , one of Doggett's former Marine associates. She reveals to Doggett that she is a Super Soldier . This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board on a naval ship. They later find connections between the experiments on the ship and Scully's child, William. After Scully begins to miss Mulder, a complete strangerthe Shadow Man Terry O'Quinn offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but unknowingly gets herself and Mulder in even more danger. The Shadow Man , who is revealed to be a Super Soldier bent on killing Scully and Mulder. After a chase through a quarry, the Shadow Man is destroyed after being exposed to magnetite. Later, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has uncovered a second spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa three years ago. Misled by the FBI, the agents enlist the help of The Lone Gunmen to protect Scully's son after they learn that the cult intends to kill the child. The cult, however, is successful in kidnapping the child. Concurrent with these events, Doggett is run over by a car, which sends him to the hospital. As Follmer and the Toothpick Man Alan Dale try to uncover the plans of the three agents, Scully and Reyes leave Washington, D.C. to find Scully's son. Doggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X Files office believing he is Mulder, Scully has his DNA tested, and the results reveal him to have the same pattern as Mulder. The disfigured man sticks a needle into William, which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind, but it is later revealed to be a cure for William's powers. The unnamed man is later revealed to be Jeffrey Spender Chris Owens , Mulder's half brother. In the season finale, Mulder returns from hiding in the attempts of finding classified information at an army base. He is caught, however, after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible Super Soldier , which causes him to be tried before a military tribunal. With the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden and Gibson Praise Jeff Gulka , Mulder breaks out, and Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old wise man , later revealed to be the Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis . He tells the two that aliens will begin colonizing the planet on December 22, 2012. Cigarette Smoking Man appears to be killed by a missile, launched under the command of Knowle Rohrer Adam Baldwin , who is revealed to be alive and well. Mulder and Scully escape, but become fugitives on the run from the FBI. The final scene of the season features the two in a motel room facing an uncertainbut possibly hopefulfuture. Following the eighth season of The X Files, David Duchovny announced that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged the other members of the crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002 she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox. With the news of the impending end to the series, the crew members decided to wrap up long running plots. Jump the Shark , the final episode to feature the Lone Gunmen, served as a de facto series finale for the cancelled X Files spin off series The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer and co writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made the studio informed Spotnitz that they did not want to bring the characters back in any capacity, as Fox reportedly hated characters . Similarly, Release was written to create closure to the story of the murder of Doggett's son. The show's crew and actors had a range of opinions about the show's finale, The Truth . Carter said of the finale, It's the endyou don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up. Gish said, It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back. Davis said, It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they found a way to get us all in again. Pileggi said, I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy get through this.' It was tough. Patrick said, It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other. Kim Manners called the final scene truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life. Former lead actor Duchovny said, In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was nice to be able to I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it. With Nothing Important Happened Today , the style of the opening credits were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. In addition, Elwes was cast to portray the new recurring character, Brad Follmer, an Assistant Director at the FBI, and Alan Dale was also written into the show as a new villain , the Toothpick Man . Lucy Lawless was cast as the intended recurring character Shannon McMahon, but she became pregnant after filming the season premiere, anddue to her high risk pregnancyhad to leave the series. After the departure of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about . And I think he recognized that it was the best thing for the show and the audience to come back and give closure to nine years of the series. Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode William he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, The Truth . Chris Carter served as executive producer and showrunner for the season and wrote nine episodes, including the two part season premiere and season finale, as well as important mytharc episodes. Spotnitz continued as executive producer and wrote seven episodes, plus receiving story credit for an additional episode. Vince Gilligan continued as executive producer and wrote three episodes. John Shiban was promoted to executive producer and wrote two episodes, plus receiving story credit for an additional episode. David Amann was promoted to supervising producer and wrote two episodes. Steven Maeda was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. Former writer for The Lone Gunmen Thomas Schnauz joined the writing staff as a story editor and wrote two episodes. Duchovny received story credit for a single episode. Manners continued as co executive producer and directed the most of episodes of the season with eight, including the two part season finale. Tony Wharmby directed three episodes. Series creator Chris Carter directed two episodes. Co executive producer Michelle MacLaren and series writer John Shiban each made their directorial debuts, directing one episode. Series writers Frank Spotnitz and Vince Gilligan each directed an episode, after previously directing their first episodes the previous season. The remaining episodes were directed by Dwight Little, Cliff Bole, and cast member David Duchovny. a Duchovny is featured in the opening credits for the two part season finale only. He also has a small uncredited cameo in William , and appears in archive footage in Trust No 1 and Jump the Shark . b Pileggi is only credited for the episodes he appears in. Episodes marked with a double dagger are episodes in the series' Alien Mythology arc. The first episode of the season, Nothing Important Happened Today , gathered 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part gathered 9.4 million viewers. On May 19, 2002, the series finale, The Truth , aired, and the Fox Broadcasting Company confirmed that The X Files was not being renewed for a tenth season. When talking about the beginning of the ninth season, Chris Carter said, We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away, and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back. The Truth received the highest Nielsen household rating and viewership numbers of the season. It earned a 7.5 rating and gathered 13.25 million viewers in the United States. The loss of viewers resulted in this season seeing a 30 percent ratings drop when compared to the eighth season. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, when commenting on the series finale, said, It's also for the good, because The X Files has long been but a pale reflection of the show it once was. Brian Linder from IGN was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's character, which The X Files crew did not do and continued what was seen by many critics as tiresome. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine was more negative to the new season, even joking about the new female lead, calling her a peppy new female presence. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said the show operated in what he called quaint territory , speculating that Chris Carter was the only one who seemed to understand the complex mytharc. Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded with, shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship , between Mulder and Scully, ended remaining interest in what was a waning phenomenon . Another review from The New York Times said of the show, The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination. The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X Files I Want to Believe as the bad apple of The X Files, describing the ninth season as clumsy mish mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so called 'super soldiers' . M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth Revisiting The X Files after 9 11, noted that season nine does not have a great reputation among viewers . However he argued that the season contains a few hidden gems and praised those episodes which dealt with new material, while criticising other entries for focusing too heavily on plotlines and characters from years gone by .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29
"Volume 1 of The X Files Mythology collection is a DVD release containing selected episodes from the first to the third seasons of the American science fiction television series The X Files. The episodes collected in the release form the beginning of the series' mythology, and are centred on alien abduction at the hands of colonists . Several of the elements introduced in the collected episodes arose through necessity during production, as working around the pregnancy of lead actress Gillian Anderson led to both the creation of unifying plot thread and the introduction of several recurring characters. The episodes in the collection follow the investigations of paranormal related cases, or X Files, by FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Anderson . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the meeting of Mulder and Scully, the introduction and assassination of a secretive informant, the apparent return of Mulder's lost sister, and the abduction and return of Scully. The collection contains the first episodes in the series' mythology, or fictional story arcs. When the series began, Chris Carter did not think of creating a mythology for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because he felt that they were just stories we wanted to tell . Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most personal episodes were those based on the government conspiracy, and, as such, developed more stories based around the conceit. Jerry Hardin, William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Tom Braidwood, Dean Haglund and Bruce Harwood all play supporting roles in the collection. Released on June 7, 2005, the collection received generally positive reviews from critics. FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder David Duchovny has made a name for himself working on X Filesunexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is appointed a partner in these investigationsDana Scully Gillian Anderson with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat Jerry Hardin , who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X Files unit is closed shortly thereafter. Unable to continue his work with Scully, Mulder obtains information about possible extraterrestrial contact in Puerto Rico, finding that the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory is being forcibly closed. Although the pair are later allowed to resume their work, Scully is later kidnapped by an unhinged multiple alien abductee, Duane Barry. Barry takes Scully to a hilltop where she is then abducted, presumably by aliens. She is found comatose at a later date, having mysteriously arrived at a hospital, and recovers several days later. Mulder receives a call from his father, finding out that his sister Samantha Megan Leitch , who had been abducted as a child, has returned. Samantha is being pursued by a shapeshifting bounty hunter, who is assassinating human clones. Samantha is killed, although it is revealed that she was simply one of a number of clones, produced using alien tissue to create an alien human hybrid. The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a successful attempt by a friend of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona Bernie Coulson , is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files are found to be written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen Floyd Red Crow Westerman a Navajo man capable of translating the filesMulder is shown a box car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man William B. Davis , and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien human hybrids. Her sister Melissa Melinda McGraw , however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night. When the series began, Chris Carter did not think of creating a mythology for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because he felt that they were just stories we wanted to tell . Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most personal episodes were those based on the government conspiracy. Another reason for the development of an ongoing mythology was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy, feeling that it would be pretentious not to do so. According to Carter, the mythology sprung from the series' pilot and its follow up, Deep Throat , which set up the idea that aliens had been on Earth for many years. Carter sees the final scene of Deep Throat as the launching moment for the entire mythology . The main theme for the series, stemming from these episodes, is Fox Mulder's quest to find the truth about his sister, Samantha Mulder, who had been abducted as a child. This quest drove the character to investigate the paranormal, setting the framework for the series. After several stand alone episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials early in the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through production of the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as the best thing that ever happened to the series , noting that the mythology really ended up running through the life of the series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant . Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson's character Scully giving birth to an alien child, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X Files at the end of the season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, reappearing comatose several episodes later. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , The Smoking Man William B. Davis and X Steven Williams , and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea . Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show. Prior to the second season episode One Breath , The Smoking Man mostly lurked around in the shadows , providing a forbidding presence. The Smoking Man uttered only four audible words in the entire first season of the show, all of them being in Tooms . Producer and director R.W. Goodwin did not have faith in William B. Davis' ability to take on the role of the series' chief antagonist. It was later revealed to the producers that Davis was running an acting school, and teaching such actors as ninth season guest star Lucy Lawless. In the two part story of Colony and End Game , Carter and Spotnitz, along with Duchovny, created what would become a recurring character in the alien bounty hunter. According to Carter, Duchovny came to him and said it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter , an idea of which Carter approved. Spotnitz has noted that the actor cast for the role, Brian Thompson, was chosen because he had a very distinctive look about him, most notably his face and mouth. Released on June 7, 2005, the collection has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising the quality of the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed in the context of the standalone episodes which were omittedsingling out Conduit and The Jersey Devil as episodes which would aid the series' dual character study . Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated the collection eight out of ten, finding that the mythology based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode Squeeze , not included in the collection, he added that even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success . However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough to keep us from complaining . Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X Files Mythology, Volume 1 Abduction is a must . Exclaim 's Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking should you buy Abduction It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, if you love the X Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once .

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the assassination of a secretive informant, Scully's diagnosis with cancer and Mulder's apparent suicide.

Steven Williams, William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi and Laurie Holden all play supporting roles in the collection. Released on August 2, 2005, the collection received mostly positive reviews from critics. The collection opens with the two part episodes Nisei and 731 . Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, FBI special agent Fox Mulder David Duchovny infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien human hybrid. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X Steven Williams . X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by the agent's partner Dana Scully Gillian Anderson . Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder Don S. Williams , who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists. The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War IIera submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burnsexcept for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil, controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and travels to Hong Kong in pursuit of a middleman selling government secrets, who Mulder has also been pursuing. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea in Hong Kong, the oil passes itself to Krycek. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister. When the Syndicate suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to MulderMarita Covarrubias Laurie Holden , the Special Representative to the Secretary General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Krycek is working with the Russians. Having been diagnosed with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , who secretly makes such a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI. During the third season the black oil was introduced, an alien entity that invaded bodies and made them into living hosts. The black oil was able to enter through a victim's mouth, eyes or nose it would leave a victim's body to revert to its original form or find a new host. The oil is revealed to be a tool used by the Colonists, brought to Earth by meteorites to create hosts of the human population living there. The fourth season episodes Tunguska and Terma were conceived by the writers when they were trying to conceive a big and fun canvas to tell stories. They decided to create a story which had connections to the Russian gulags, which led to the natural idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the black oil. Writer John Shiban felt it was natural creating an arms race like story between the United States and Russia, being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier. The inspiration for the oil containing rocks was NASA's announcement of possible evidence of extraterrestrial life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite while the gulag scenes were based on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich The on screen appearance of the black oil was achieved through visual effects the shimmering oil effect was digitally placed over the actors' corneas in post production. The crew went through various iterations to find the two right types of fluids. According to physical effects crewman David Gauthier, they used a mix of oil and acetone, which he believed gave the substance a more globular look. During the filming of Apocrypha , Nicholas Lea was fitted with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene was horrible, and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later. A similar scene from the start of the episode with the submarine captain was accomplished using a dummy head. The decision to have the character of X killed off in Herrenvolk was made at the end of the third season. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Mulder. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the fourth season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as a cheap TV thing . However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an obligatory move to have Scully follow suit. Released on August 2, 2005, the collection has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three and a half stars out of five, noting that there is an unabashed confidence to these episodes , although this comes with something of a price as the thrill and surprise of season two mythology stories like Colony and End Game are replaced by a nagging suspicion that the writers are starting to tread water . Uhlich singles out Talitha Cumi as the collection's highlight, calling it an overall mindblower . Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, calling it highly recommended . However, he felt that the cohesion between the episodes was lacking somewhat, and that the two part episodes Tempus Fugit and Max did not add much to the overall storyline. Exclaim 's Monica S. Kuebler, on the other hand, felt negatively about the collection. She too felt that the interrupted nature of the episodes caused a lack of believable pacing, and noted that the release feels like a blatant cash grab by Fox to milk an old franchise while they still can .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%202%20%E2%80%93%20Black%20Oil

As a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender Veronica Cartwright , a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens. Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender Chris Owens , angrily attempts to push his way up in the FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so. Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X Files they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise Jeff Gulka . In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X Files division Mulder and Scully have been replaced by Spender and Diana Fowley Mimi Rogers . Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea , a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien human hybrid. The Smoking Man William B. Davis reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandrasave The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man. Several months later, a metallic artifact with inscriptions is discovered on the beach of Cote d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping to find a cure for her partner, Scully rushes to Africa and discovers a massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the ocean. Skinner and Michael Kritschgau John Finn desperately attempt to find the truth behind the alien object. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder, but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away to transplant the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium, but the surgery is a failure. While investigating a bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder soon discovers the truth about his sister's disappearance. It is revealed that his sister was taken by walk ins , benevolent spirit who save the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. Together, Mulder and Scully locate evidence that proves that Samantha was abducted by The Smoking Man, and was forced to live in a now abandoned US Army base. Mulder eventually is reunited with the spirit of his sister, allowing him to finally let go. Mulder and Scully investigate a case of alien abduction which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together. While investigating, Mulder is taken by a UFO. Scully soon meets Special Agent John Doggett Robert Patrick , the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to conduct a search for Fox Mulder. Although the search ultimately proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X Files and works with Scully to look for explanations to several cases. From the third season to the sixth season, the mysterious Syndicate was explored in detail. In the two part episode Two Fathers One Son , the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology in a new direction was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole storyline of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore. The Biogenesis The Sixth Extinction Amor Fati trio of episodes started a new mythology for the series, questioning the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder an Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes Two Fathers and One Son . Closure was written to create an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, I think series star, David Duchovny grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. ... I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play .' Paul Rabwin noted that, It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away. Requiem was written as a way to potentially end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day. Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year. They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett. Critical reception to the release ranged from mixed to positive. Monica S. Kuebler from Exclaim magazine noted that, while the set was only for diehards, completists , the compilation was the strongest of the mythology boxes thus far . She went on to name the Biogenesis The Sixth Extinction Amor Fati arc the best of the set. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk, was more critical, however. He wrote that, although the story was interesting, intriguing, and entertaining , the selection of episodes does not offer the same level of excitement when compared to the previous two volumes. He concluded by commenting that there is enough entertainment value for you to enjoy . Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine awarded the box set three and a half stars out of five. He commented on the conclusion of many of the show's long running arcs, and noted that Mulder was often only a witness to these events, such as the destruction of the Syndicate and the death of his sister. Of the latter, Uhlich wrote that he waver back and forth on how emotionally effective it is . He did, however, award the image quality of the DVDs four stars out of five and refer to their presentation as excellent .

"The X Files Mythology Volume 4 collection is the fourth DVD release containing selected episodes from the eighth to the ninth seasons of the American science fiction television series The X Files. The episodes collected in the release form the end of the series' mythology, and are centered on those that involve the alien Super Soldiers and Dana Scully's Gillian Anderson son, William. The collection contains seven episodes from the eighth season and seven from the ninth.

Adam Baldwin, Chris Owens, Nicholas Lea, Laurie Holden, and William B. Davis all play supporting roles in the collection. When Dana Scully Gillian Anderson learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy. John Doggett Robert Patrick introduces Scully to Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish , an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Fox Mulder's David Duchovny deceased body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi is threatened by Alex Krycek Nicholas Lea that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles, a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity. Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government have replaced several humans, including Miles and several high ranking FBI personnel, with so called alien Super Soldiers . Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonization of Earth. They have learned that Scully's baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be greater than them. When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after Skinner kills Krycek, Scully delivers an apparently normal baby while the alien Super Soldiers surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment. Mulder goes into hiding, Scully is again reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Reyes becomes Doggett's new FBI partner at the X Files office. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes discover a conspiracy to place Chloramine in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating Super Soldiers . This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board, with connections to Scully's child, William. The X Files office's investigation is hampered by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh James Pickens, Jr. and Assistant Director Brad Follmer Cary Elwes . Hopeful about reuniting with Mulder, a complete stranger, Shadow Man Terry O'Quinn , offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding. Scully takes the offer, but near gets herself and Mulder killed when it is revealed the man is a Super Soldier. Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has found a spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa two years ago. The cult kidnaps William, but is destroyed when the baby's crying activates the ship, killing everyone in the cult, sans William. Doggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X Files office. Initially, Doggett believes the man is Mulder, but he is revealed to Jeffrey Spender Chris Owens , Mulder's half brother. Spender sticks a needle into William, which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind, but is later revealed to be a cure for William's powers. Mulder returns from hiding to only be discovered looking for classified information at an army base and, after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible Super Soldier Knowle Rohrer Adam Baldwin , he is placed on trial to defend the X Files and himself. But with the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, Marita Covarrubias Laurie Holden and Gibson Praise Jeff Gulka , Mulder breaks out. Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old wise man , who is later revealed to be The Smoking Man William B. Davis , who tells them that the aliens will arrive in 2012. Doggett and Reyes aid Mulder and Scully in escaping the FBI, and the two are last seen together in a motel room facing an uncertain future. After settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full time participation in the show after the seventh season. In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, Requiem. After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 eighth season episodes. Thus, Per Manum marked the return of Duchovny as Mulder, although he had appeared briefly in flashback appearances and small cameos. Series creator Chris Carter later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the characterization, noting that there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eight and ninth seasons. After the end of the eighth season, Duchovny announced that he would leave the show for good. In addition, lead actress Anderson's contract also expired at the end of the eighth season. Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying For a lot of people, if you don't like your job, you can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option. Anderson cited the fact that eight years is a long time as a contributing factor to her indifference. However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a generous incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show. With the departure of Duchovny and limited use of Anderson, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, saying the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show. Going into the ninth season, the producers decided to drastically change the show. The style of the opening credits in Nothing Important Happened Today were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, The Truth , was written by series creator Carter he later noted, It's the endyou don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up. He expounded on the idea, saying, Frank and I it was probably time to go ... it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things. Spotnitz explained, What was kind of nice that Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due. Gish later said, I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain . Bruce Harwood called the finale the passing of a generation . The collection, as well as the episodes themselves, received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Monica Kuebler of Exclaim gave the collection a rather negative review and noted that it closed on a lacklustre note . Furthermore, she wrote that the main issue with the release was that the hardcore fans had come to see The X Files as Mulder and Scully and understandably weren't quick to swallow a couple of new characters running the department. Ultimately, she concluded that the poor episodes and the lack of bonus features included with the collection were proof that Fox seems eager to wash their hands of the disappointing demise of the show . Sabadino Parker from PopMatters wrote negatively about the mythology of the last two seasons, noting that story itself became even more convoluted and that the past two seasons should never have happened. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker speculated that Chris Carter was the only one who seemed to understand the show's complex mytharc. Joyce Millman from The New York Times called the storyline involving Scully's childwhich left her haunted and irritable a sad misuse of the radiant Anderson . The A.V. Club was highly critical of the final season and its mythology story, calling them a clumsy mish mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so called 'super soldiers' . A. In some regions, the last episode, The Truth is split up into two episodes, and not one.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%204%20%E2%80%93%20Super%20Soldiers
"The X Files is an American science fiction drama television series created by Chris Carter. The original television series aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on Fox. The program spanned nine seasons, with 202 episodes. A short tenth season consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this revival, Fox announced in April 2017 that The X Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, concluding on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two feature films have been released The 1998 film The X Files, which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand alone film The X Files I Want to Believe, released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended. The series revolves around Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny , and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who investigate X Files marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep the existence of extraterrestrial life a secret. They develop a close relationship which begins as a platonic friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series spanning story arc, monster of the week episodes form roughly two thirds of all episodes. The X Files was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, Twin Peaks, and especially Kolchak The Night Stalker. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced FBI agents John Doggett Robert Patrick and Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish . Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner Mitch Pileggi , also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X Files I Want to Believe as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series. The X Files was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by its conclusion the show was the longest running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes Millennium and The Lone Gunmen spin offs, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. The X Files follows the careers and personal lives of FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson . Mulder is a talented profiler and strong believer in the supernatural. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname Spooky Mulder and an assignment to a little known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the X Files. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed abduction of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain objectivity in his investigations. Agent Scully is a foil for Mulder in this regard. As a medical doctor and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity. She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically. After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the seventh season finale Requiem , Scully becomes a reluctant believer who manages to explain the paranormal with science. Various episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically. Mulder and Scully are joined by John Doggett Robert Patrick and Monica Reyes Annabeth Gish late in the series, after Mulder is abducted. Doggett replaces him as Scully's partner and helps her search for him, later involving Reyes, of whom Doggett had professional knowledge. The initial run of The X Files ends when Mulder is secretly subjected to a military tribunal for breaking into a top secret military facility and viewing plans for alien invasion and colonization of Earth. He is found guilty, but he escapes punishment with the help of the other agents and he and Scully become fugitives. As the show progressed, key episodes, called parts of the Mytharc , were recognized as the mythology of the series canon these episodes carried the extraterrestrial conspiracy storyline that evolved throughout the series. Monster of the week often abbreviated as MOTW or MoW came to denote the remainder of The X Files episodes. These episodes, comprising the majority of the series, dealt with paranormal phenomena, including cryptids, mutants, science fiction technology, horror monsters, and religious phenomena. Some of the Monster of the Week episodes even featured satiric elements and comedic story lines. The main story arc involves the agents' efforts to uncover a government conspiracy that covers up the existence of extraterrestrials and their sinister collaboration with said government. Mysterious men comprising a shadow element within the U.S. government, known as The Syndicate , are the major villains in the series late in the series it is revealed that The Syndicate acts as the only liaison between mankind and a group of extraterrestrials that intends to destroy the human species. They are usually represented by Cigarette Smoking Man William B. Davis , a ruthless killer, masterful politician, negotiator, failed novelist, and the series' principal antagonist. As the series goes along, Mulder and Scully learn about evidence of the alien invasion piece by piece. It is revealed that the extraterrestrials plan on using a sentient virus, known as the black oil also known as Purity , to infect mankind and turn the population of the world into a slave race. The Syndicatehaving made a deal to be spared by the alienshave been working to develop an alien human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of season five, as well as the 1998 film. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization. Eventually, in the season six episodes Two Fathers One Son , the rebels manage to destroy the Syndicate. The colonists, now without human liaisons, dispatch the Super Soldiers beings that resemble humans, but are biologically alien. In the latter parts of season eight, and the whole of season nine, the Super Soldiers manage to replace key individuals in the government, forcing Mulder and Scully to go into hiding. Chris Carter on creating the characters of Mulder and Scully. California native Chris Carter was given the opportunity to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series Kolchak The Night Stalker, triggered the idea for The X Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992. Carter's initial pitch for The X Files was rejected by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone as well as from The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was determined to keep the relationship between the two leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series. The early 1990s series Twin Peaks was a major influence on the show's dark atmosphere and its often surreal blend of drama and irony. Duchovny had appeared as a cross dressing DEA agent in Twin Peaks and the Mulder character was seen as a parallel to that show's FBI Agent Dale Cooper. The producers and writers cited All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Rashomon, The Thing, The Boys from Brazil, The Silence of the Lambs and JFK as other influences. Carter's use of continuous takes in Triangle was modeled on Hitchcock's Rope. In addition, episodes written by Darin Morgan often referred to or referenced other films. Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles for three years prior to The X Files at first he wanted to focus on feature films. In 1993, his manager, Melanie Green, gave him the script for the pilot episode of The X Files. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so he auditioned for the lead. Duchovny's audition was terrific , though he talked rather slowly. While the casting director of the show was very positive toward him, Carter thought that he was not particularly intelligent. He asked Duchovny if he could please imagine himself as an FBI agent in future episodes. Duchovny, however, turned out to be one of the best read people that Carter knew. Anderson auditioned for the role of Scully in 1993. I couldn't put the script down , she recalled. The network wanted either a more established or a taller, leggier, blonder and breastier actress for Scully than the 24 year old Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience. After auditions, Carter felt she was the only choice. Carter insisted that Anderson had the kind of no nonsense integrity that the role required. For portraying Scully, Anderson won numerous major awards the Screen Actors Guild Award in 1996 and 1997, an Emmy Award in 1997, and a Golden Globe Award 1997. The character Walter Skinner was played by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for the roles of two or three other characters on The X Files before getting the part. At first, the fact that he was asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those rolesCarter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role. Before the seventh season aired, Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox. He was upset because, he claimed, Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about 20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh seasons and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role of Doggett, but only about ten were seriously considered. Lou Diamond Phillips, Hart Bochner, and Bruce Campbell were among the ten. The producers chose Robert Patrick. Carter believed that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned in both seasons eight and nine to emphasize the new actors along with Pileggi, who was finally listed as a main character . Doggett's presence did not give the series the ratings boost the network executives were hoping for. The eighth season episode This is Not Happening marked the first appearance of Monica Reyes, played by Gish, who became a main character in season nine. Her character was developed and introduced due to Anderson's possible departure at the end of the eighth season. Although Anderson stayed until the end, Gish became a series regular. Glen Morgan and James Wong's early influence on The X Files mythology led to their introduction of popular secondary characters who continued for years in episodes written by others Scully's father, William Don S. Davis her mother, Margaret Sheila Larken and her sister, Melissa Melinda McGraw . The conspiracy inspired trio The Lone Gunmen were also secondary characters. The trio was introduced in the first season episode E.B.E. as a way to make Mulder appear more credible. They were originally meant to appear in only that episode, but due to their popularity, they returned in the second season episode Blood and became recurring characters. Cigarette Smoking Man portrayed by William B. Davis, was initially cast as an extra in the pilot episode. His character, however, grew into the main antagonist. During the early stages of production, Carter founded Ten Thirteen Productions and began to plan for filming the pilot in Los Angeles. However, unable to find suitable locations for many scenes, he decided to go where the good forests are and moved production to Vancouver. It was soon realized by the production crew that since so much of the first season would require filming on location, rather than on sound stages, a second location manager would be needed. The show remained in Vancouver for the first five seasons production then shifted to Los Angeles beginning with the sixth season. Duchovny was unhappy over his geographical separation from his wife Tea Leoni, although his discontent was popularly attributed to frustration with Vancouver's persistent rain. Anderson also wanted to return to the United States and Carter relented following the fifth season. The season ended in May 1998 with The End , the final episode shot in Vancouver and the final episode with the involvement of many of the original crew members, including director and producer R.W. Goodwin and his wife Sheila Larken, who played Margaret Scully and would later return briefly. With the move to Los Angeles, many changes behind the scenes occurred, as much of the original The X Files crew was gone. New production designer Corey Kaplan, editor Lynne Willingham, writer David Amann and director and producer Michael Watkins joined and stayed for several years. Bill Roe became the show's new director of photography and episodes generally had a drier, brighter look due to California's sunshine and climate, as compared with Vancouver's rain, fog and temperate forests. Early in the sixth season, the producers took advantage of the new location, setting the show in new parts of the country. For example, Vince Gilligan's Drive , about a man subject to an unexplained illness, was a frenetic action episode, unusual for The X Files largely because it was set in Nevada's stark desert roads. The Dreamland two part episode was also set in Nevada, this time in Area 51. The episode was largely filmed at Club Ed , a movie ranch located on the outskirts of Lancaster, California. Although the sixth through ninth seasons were filmed in Los Angeles, the series' second movie, The X Files I Want to Believe 2008 , was filmed in Vancouver, According to Spotnitz, the film script was written for the city and surrounding areas. The 2016 revival was also shot there. The music was composed by Mark Snow, who got involved with The X Files through his friendship with executive producer Goodwin. Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff as to whether they wanted him. One day, however, Snow's agent called him, talking about the pilot episode and hinting that he had got the job. The theme, The X Files , used more instrumental sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect was inspired by the track How Soon Is Now from the US edition of The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rack mount synth with an effect called Whistling Joe . After hearing this effect, Carter was taken aback and noted it was going to be good . According to the Behind the Truth segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter walked out of the room and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter Snow said, this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it. The second episode, Deep Throat , marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in Deep Throat . Snow was tasked with composing the score for both The X Files films. The films marked the first appearance of real orchestral instruments previous music had been crafted by Snow using digitally sampled instrument sounds. Snow's soundtrack for the first film, The X Files Original Motion Picture Score, was released in 1998. For the second film, Snow recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City. UNKLE recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation of silly putty and dimes tucked into piano strings. Snow commented that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track Prospectors Quartet from the There Will Be Blood soundtrack. The soundtrack score, The X Files I Want to Believe Original Motion Picture Score, was released in 2008. The opening sequence was made in 1993 for the first season and remained unchanged until Duchovny left the show. Carter sought to make the title an impactful opening with supernatural images . These scenes notably include a split screen image of a seed germinating as well as a terror filled, warped face . The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect. The sequence was extremely popular and won the show its first Emmy Award, which was for Outstanding Graphic Design and Title Sequences. Rabwin was particularly pleased with the sequence and felt that it was something that had never seen on television before . In 2017, James Charisma of Paste magazine ranked the show's opening sequence 8 on a list of The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time. The premiere episode of season eight, Within , revealed the first major change to the opening credits. Along with Patrick, the sequence used new images and updated photos for Duchovny and Anderson, although Duchovny only appears in the opening credits when he appears in an episode. Carter and the production staff saw Duchovny's departure as a chance to change things. The replacement shows various pictures of Scully's pregnancy. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the sequence also features an abstract way of showing Mulder's absence in the eighth season he falls into an eye. Season nine featured an entirely new sequence. Since Anderson wanted to move on, the sequence featured Reyes and Skinner. Duchovny's return to the show for the ninth season finale, The Truth marked the largest number of cast members to be featured in the opening credits, with five. The revival seasons use the series' original opening credits sequence. The sequence ends with the tagline The Truth Is Out There , which is used for the majority of the episodes. The tagline changes in specific episodes to slogans that are relevant to that episode. The following episodes received alternate taglines The pilot premiered on September 10, 1993, and reached 12 million viewers. As the season progressed, ratings began to increase and the season finale garnered 14 million viewers. The first season ranked 105th out of 128 shows during the 199394 television season. The series' second season increased in ratingsa trend that would continue for the next three seasonsand finished 63rd out of 141 shows. These ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to receive the label cult hit , particularly by Fox standards. Most importantly it made great gains among the 18 to 49 age demographic sought by advertisers. During its third year, the series ranked 55th and was viewed by an average of 15.40 million viewers, an increase of almost seven percent over the second season, making it Fox's top rated program in the 1849 year old demographic. Although the first three episodes of the fourth season aired on Friday night, the fourth episode Unruhe aired on Sunday night. The show remained on Sunday until its end. The season hit a high with its twelfth episode, Leonard Betts , which was chosen as the lead out program following Super Bowl XXXI. The episode was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, the series' highest rated episode. The fifth season debuted with Redux I on November 2, 1997 and was viewed by 27.34 million people, making it the highest rated non special broadcast episode of the series. The season ranked as the eleventh most watched series during the 199798 year, with an average of 19.8 million viewers. It was the series' highest rated season as well as Fox' highest rated program during the 199798 season. The sixth season premiered with The Beginning , watched by 20.24 million viewers. The show ended season six with lower numbers than the previous season, beginning a decline that would continue for the show's final three years. The X Files was nevertheless Fox's highest rated show that year. The seventh season, originally intended as the show's last, ranked as the 29th most watched show for the 19992000 year, with 14.20 million viewers. This made it, at the time, the lowest rated year of the show since the third season. The first episode of season eight, Within , was viewed by 15.87 million viewers. The episode marked an 11 decrease from the seventh season opener, The Sixth Extinction . The first part of the ninth season opener, Nothing Important Happened Today , only attracted 10.6 million viewers, the series' lowest rated season premiere. The original series finale, The Truth , attracted 13.25 million viewers, the series' lowest rated season finale. The ninth season was the 63rd most watched show for the 200102 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X Files was over. When talking about the beginning of the ninth season, Carter said We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back. While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X Files had become the longest running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG 1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011. The debut episode of the 2016 revival, My Struggle , first aired on January 24, 2016 and was watched by 16.19 million viewers. In terms of viewers, this made it the highest rated episode of The X Files to air since the eighth season episode This Is Not Happening in 2001, which was watched by 16.9 million viewers. When DVR and streaming are taken into account, My Struggle was seen by 21.4 million viewers, scoring a 7.1 Nielsen rating. The season ended with My Struggle II , which was viewed by 7.60 million viewers. In total, the season was viewed by an average of 13.6 million viewers it ranked as the seventh most watched television series of the 201516 year, making it the highest ranked season of The X Files to ever air. After several successful seasons, Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately turned into a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story that would not require the viewer to be familiar with the broadcast series. The movie was filmed in the hiatus between the show's fourth and fifth seasons and re shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season. Due to the demands on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season focused on just one of the two leads. On June 19, 1998, the eponymous The X Files, also known as The X Files Fight the Future was released. The crew intended the movie to be a continuation of the season five finale The End , but was also meant to stand on its own. The season six premiere, The Beginning , began where the film ended. The film was written by Carter and Spotnitz and directed by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film. It also featured the last appearance of John Neville as the Well Manicured Man. Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praisecharacters who had been introduced in the fifth season finale and or were integral to the television seriesdo not appear in the film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical releasedue in part to its large promotional budgetThe X Files film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached 189 million. The film's production cost and ad budgets were each close to 66 million. Unlike the series, Anderson and Duchovny received equal pay for the film. In November 2001, Carter decided to pursue a second film adaptation. Production was slated to begin after the ninth season, with a projected release in December 2003. In April 2002, Carter reiterated his desire and the studio's desire to do a sequel film. He planned to write the script over the summer and begin production in spring or summer 2003 for a 2004 release. Carter described the film as independent of the series, saying We're looking at the movies as stand alones. They're not necessarily going to have to deal with the mythology. Bowman, who had directed various episodes of The X Files in the past as well as the 1998 film, expressed an interest in the sequel, but Carter took the job. Spotnitz co authored the script with Carter. The X Files I Want to Believe became the second film based on the series, after 1998's The X Files Fight the Future. Filming began in December 2007 in Vancouver and finished on March 11, 2008. The film was released in the United States on July 25, 2008. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carter said that if I Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose a third movie that would return to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. The film grossed 4 million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of 10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed 20,982,478 domestically and an additional 47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of 68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported mixed or average reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32 of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics' consensus stating The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X Files' televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we're meant to believe in. In several interviews around the release, Carter said that if the X Files I Want to Believe film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X Files movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X Files film is looking pretty good . As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 1013, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that's what it would be. On January 17, 2015, Fox confirmed that they were looking at the possibility of bringing The X Files back, not as a movie, but as a limited run television season. Fox chairman Dana Walden told reporters that conversations so far have only been logistical and are in very early stages and that the series would only go forward if Carter, Anderson, and Duchovny were all on board, and that it was a matter of ensuring all of their timetables are open. On March 24, 2015, it was confirmed the series would return with series creator Chris Carter and lead actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. It premiered on January 24, 2016. On April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced that The X Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which premiered on January 3, 2018. In January 2018, Gillian Anderson confirmed that season 11 would be her final season of The X Files. The following month, Carter stated in an interview that he could see the show continuing without Anderson. In May 2018, Fox's co CEO Gary Newman commented that there are no plans to do another season at the moment. On September 24, 1996, the first wave set of The X Files VHS tapes were released. Wave sets were released covering the first through fourth seasons. Each wave was three VHS tapes, each containing two episodes, for a total of six episodes per wave and two waves per season. For example, the home video release of wave one drew from the first half of the first season Pilot Deep Throat , Conduit Ice and Fallen Angel Eve . Each wave was also available in a boxed set. Unlike later DVD season releases, the tapes did not include every episode from the seasons. Ultimately twelve episodesapproximately half the total number airedwere selected by Carter to represent each season, including nearly all mythology arc episodes and selected standalone episodes. Carter briefly introduced each episode with an explanation of why the episode was chosen and anecdotes from the set. These clips were later included on the full season DVDs. Wave eight, covering the last part of the fourth season, was the last to be released. No Carter interviews appeared on DVDs for later seasons. Many of the waves had collectible cards for each episode. All nine seasons were released on DVD along with the two films. The entire series was re released on DVD in early 2006, in a slimmer package. The first five slim case versions did not come with some bonus materials that were featured in the original fold out versions. However, seasons six, seven, eight and nine all contained the bonus materials found in the original versions. Episodic DVDs have also been released in Region 2, such as Deadalive , Existence , Nothing Important Happened Today , Providence and The Truth . Various other episodes were released on DVD and VHS. In 2005, four DVD sets were released containing the main story arc episodes of The X Files. The four being Volume 1 Abduction, Volume 2 Black Oil, Volume 3 Colonization and Volume 4 Super Soldiers. A boxed set containing all nine seasons and the first film was made available in 2007, which contains all of the special features from the initial releases. The set also includes an additional disc of new bonus features and various collectibles, including a poster for the first film, a comic book, a set of collector cards and a guide to all 202 episodes across all nine seasons and the first film. Due to the fact that the set was released in 2007, the second film, which was released in 2008, is not included. Release of The X Files' seasons on Blu ray, restored in high definition, was rumored to begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of The X Files in high definition, marking the first time that the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the wrong fonts for the title sequence and season 8 was affected by color balance issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes. These issues led to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct color balance. The Lone Gunmen is an American science fiction television series created by Carter and broadcast on Fox, and was crafted as a more humorous spin off of The X Files. The series starred the eponymous Lone Gunmen, and was first broadcast in March 2001, during The X Files's month long hiatus. Although the debut episode garnered 13.23 million viewers, its ratings began to steadily drop. The program was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The last episode was broadcast in June 2001 and ended on a cliffhanger which was partially resolved in a ninth season episode of The X Files titled Jump the Shark . The X Files was converted into a comic book series published by Topps Comics during the show's third and fourth seasons. The initial comic books were written solely by Stefan Petrucha. According to Petrucha, there were three types of stories those that dealt with the characters, those that dealt with the conspiracy, and the monster of the week sort of stuff . Petrucha cited the latter as the easiest to write. Petrucha saw Scully as a scientist ... with real world faith , and that the difference between is not that Mulder believes and Scully doesn't it's more a difference in procedure. In this manner, Mulder's viewpoint was often written to be just as valid as Scully's, and Scully's science was often portrayed to be just as convincing as Mulder's more outlandish ideas. Petrucha was eventually fired and various other authors took up the job. Topps published 41 regular issues of The X Files from 199598. A 30 Days of Night The X Files cross over graphic novel was published by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of murders that may be linked to vampires. In 2013, it was announced that The X Files would return to comic book form with Season 10 , now published by IDW. The series, which follows Mulder and Scully after the events of The X Files I Want to Believe, was released in June 2013. Joe Harris wrote the series, and Michael Walsh and Jordie Bellaire provided the artwork. It was later announced that Carter himself would be the executive producer for the series and would be providing feedback to the creative team regarding scripts and outlines to keep the new stories in line with existing and on going canon. The series restarted the series' mythology, and the first arc of the story focused on seek to bring the mythology of the Alien Conspiracy back up to date in a more paranoid, post terror, post WikiLeaks society. In addition, sequels to popular Monster of the Week episodes were made. The X Files Season 10 concluded on July 1, 2015 after 25 issues. In August 2015, The X Files Season 11 comic book began, also published by IDW. The 8 issue series served as a continuation of the TV show. Chris Carter was the Executive Producer of the comic book series, while the issues were written by Joe Harris and illustrated by Matthew Dow Smith and Jordie Bellaire. The X Files received positive reviews from television critics, with many calling it one of the best series that aired on American television in the 1990s. Ian Burrell from the British newspaper The Independent called the show one of the greatest cult shows in modern television . Richard Corliss from Time magazine called the show the cultural touchstone of the 1990s.

The Evening Herald said the show had overwhelming influence on television, in front of such shows as The Simpsons. In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at 4 in the 25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years , describing it as a paean to oddballs, sci fi fans, conspiracy theorists and Area 51 pilgrims everywhere. Ratings improved every year for the first five seasons, while Mulder and Scully's believer versus skeptic dynamic created a TV template that's still in heavy use today. In 2004 and 2007, The X Files ranked 2 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever . In 2002, the show ranked as the 37th best television show of all time. In 1997, the episodes Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose and Small Potatoes respectively ranked 10 and 72 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time .

Empire magazine ranked The X Files ninth best TV show in history, further claiming that the best episode was the third season entry Jose Chung's From Outer Space . In 2015, on The Hollywood Reporter's entertainment industry ranked TV list Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows , The X Files appeared at 3. According to The Guardian, MediaDNA research discovered that The X Files was on top of the list of the most innovative TV brands. In 2009, it was announced that the show's catchphrase The Truth Is Out There was among Britain's top 60 best known slogans and quotes. The X Files has been criticized for being unscientific and privileging paranormal and supernatural ideas e.g. the hypotheses made by Mulder . For instance, in 1998, Richard Dawkins wrote that The X Files systematically purveys an anti rational view of the world which, by virtue of its recurrent persistence, is insidious. The pilot episode was generally well received by fans and critics. Variety criticized the episode for using reworked concepts , but praised the production and noted its potential. Of the acting, Variety said Duchovny's delineation of a serious scientist with a sense of humor should win him partisans and Anderson's wavering doubter connects well. They're a solid team...' Variety praised the writing and direction Mandel's cool direction of Carter's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci fi a boost. The magazine concluded, Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self conscious and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV. Entertainment Weekly said that Scully was set up as a scoffing skeptic in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of four episodes, the magazine called The X Files the most paranoid, subversive show on TV , noting the marvelous tension between Andersonwho is dubious about these eventsand Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer . Virgin Media said the most memorable Monster of the Week was Eugene Tooms from Squeeze and Tooms . The following four seasons received similar praise. During the show's second season, Entertainment Weekly named The X Files the Program of the Year for 1994, stating no other show on television gives off the vibe that The X Files does . The DVD Journal gave the second season four out of four stars, calling it a memorable season . The review highlighted The Host , Duane Barry and Ascension , the cliffhanger finale Anasazi , the unforgettable Humbug and meeting Mulder and Scully's families in Colony and One Breath . IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had started to explore a little and the evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar . Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club argued that the third season of The X Files was the show's best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time , noting it was consistent and from strength to strength between mythology and stand alone episodes. Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the fifth season an A , writing that it proves the show waseven thenstill at its creative peak if only for another year or so and full of surprises . He praised the new additions to the series' mythology and concluded that many stand alone episodes now look like classics . Francis Dass, writing for the New Straits Times, noted that the season was very interesting and possessed some ... truly inspiring and hilarious episodes. After the 1998 film, the show began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some longtime fans became alienated during the show's sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the Monsters of the Week style, they were often romantic or humorous or both, such as Arcadia or Terms of Endearment . Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was making it all up as he goes along . As for the seventh season, The A.V. Club noted that while most of the first eight seasons of The X Files was good to great , the seventh season of the show was flagging and possessed significant problems . Despite this, seasons six and seven included several episodes that were lauded by critics, including the sixth season entries Triangle and The Unnatural , as well as the seventh season installment X Cops . The show's eighth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club noted that the eighth season was revitalized by the new 'search for Mulder' story arc . Amy H. Sturgis commended the eighth season, praising Anderson's performance as Scully as excellence and positively wrote that Doggett was non Mulderish . Collin Polonowonski from DVD Times said that the season included more hits than misses overall but offered a negative word about the mythology episodes, claiming that they were the weakest episodes in the season. Jesse Hassenger from PopMatters, however, criticized the new season, claiming that Patrick was miscast and calling Duchovny's appearances as Mulder shallow. The ninth season received mixed to negative reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show a pale reflection of the show it once was . Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship , between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a waning phenomenon . Another The New York Times review stated, The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination. The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X Files I Want to Believe as the bad apple of The X Files franchise, describing the ninth season as clumsy mish mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so called 'super soldiers' . Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters. The 2016 revival of the show was met with mixed reviews the first and last episodes were met with lukewarm to negative reviews from critics, whereas episodes two through five were generally well received. The third episode in particular, named Mulder and Scully Meet the Were Monster , was praised by critics, with Alex McCown of The A.V. Club calling it an instant classic . Overall, the review aggregator Metacritic gave the season a score of 60 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.

The X Files was also nominated for nine Satellite Awards, managing to win two of them and two Young Artist Awards, winning one. As The X Files saw its viewership expand from a small, but devoted group of fans to a worldwide mass cult audience, digital telecommunications were becoming mainstream. According to The New York Times, this may have been the first show to find its audience growth tied to the growth of the Internet . The X Files incorporated new technologies into storylines beginning in the early seasons Mulder and Scully communicated on cellular phones, e mail contact with secret informants provided plot points in episodes such as Colony and Anasazi , while The Lone Gunmen were portrayed as Internet aficionados as early as 1994. Many X Files fans also had online access. Fans of the show became commonly known as X Philes , a term coined from the Greek root phil meaning love or obsession. In addition to watching the show, X Philes reviewed episodes themselves on unofficial websites, formed communities with other fans through Usenet newsgroups and listservs, and wrote their own fan fiction. The X Files also caught on with viewers who wouldn't ordinarily consider themselves sci fi fans . While Carter argued that the show was plot driven, many fans saw it as character driven. Duchovny and Anderson were characterized as Internet sex symbols . As the show grew in popularity, subgroups of fans developed, such as shippers hoping for a romantic or sexual partnership between Mulder and Scully, or those who already perceived one between the lines. Other groups arose to pay tribute to the stars or their characters, while others joined the subculture of slash fiction. In the summer of 1996, a journalist wrote, there are entire forums online devoted to the 'M S' relationship . In addition to MOTW , Internet fans invented acronyms such as UST meaning unresolved sexual tension and COTR standing for conversation on the rock referencing a popular scene in the third season episode Quagmire to aid in their discussions of the agents' relationship, which was itself identified as the MSR . The producers did not endorse some fans' readings, according to a study on the subject Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos those against the idea of a Mulder Scully romance that theirs is the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show's success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He can deny that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be. The Scully obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode Milagro was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent . The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after them. The best example is Leyla Harrison. Played by Jolie Jenkins and introduced in the eighth season episode Alone , Harrison, was created and named in memory of an Internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001. The X Files spawned an industry of spin off products. In 2004, U.S. based Topps Comics and most recently, DC Comics imprint Wildstorm launched a new series of licensed tie in comics. During the series' run, the Fox Broadcasting Company published the official The X Files Magazine. The X Files Collectible Card Game was released in 1996 and an expansion set was released in 1997. The X Files has inspired four video games. In 1998, The X Files Game was released for the PC and Macintosh and a year later for the PlayStation. This game is set within the timeline of the second or third season and follows an Agent Craig Willmore in his search for the missing Mulder and Scully. In 2000, Fox Interactive released The X Files Unrestricted Access, a game style database for Windows and Mac, which allowed users access to every case file. Then, in 2004, The X Files Resist or Serve was released. The game is a survival horror game released for the PlayStation 2 and is an original story set in the seventh season. It allows the player control of both Mulder and Scully. Both games feature acting and voice work from members of the series' cast. In February 2018, a mobile mystery investigation game The X Files Deep State was released on iOS, Android and Facebook. The story of the game takes place between seasons 9 and 10 of the show, and follows two FBI agents, Casey Winter and Garret Dale, as they investigate a sinister conspiracy. A 6 player pinball game, called The X Files, was produced by Sega in 1997. The X Files directly inspired other TV series, including Strange World, The Burning Zone, Special Unit 2, Mysterious Ways, Lost, Dark Skies, The Visitor, Fringe, Warehouse 13, Supernatural, and Gravity Falls, with key aspects carried over to more standard crime dramas, such as Eleventh Hour and Bones. The influence can be seen on other levels television series such as Lost developed their own complex mythologies. In terms of characterization, the role of Dana Scully was seen as innovative, changing how women were not just perceived but behaved and perhaps influencing the portrayal of other strong women investigators. Russell T Davies said The X Files had been an inspiration on his series Torchwood, describing it as dark, wild and sexy... The X Files meets This Life . Other shows have been influenced by the tone and mood of The X Files. For example, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew from the mood and coloring of The X Files, as well as from its occasional blend of horror and humor creator Joss Whedon described his show as a cross between The X Files and My So Called Life . It also inspired themes in video games Deus Ex and Perfect Dark. The show's popularity led it to become a major aspect of popular culture. The show is parodied in The Simpsons season eight episode The Springfield Files , which aired on January 12, 1997. In it, Mulder and Scullyvoiced by Duchovny and Andersonare sent to Springfield to investigate an alien sighting by Homer Simpson, but end up finding no evidence other than Homer's word and depart. Cigarette Smoking Man appears in the background when Homer is interviewed and the show's theme plays during one particular scene. Nathan Ditum from Total Film ranked Duchovny and Anderson's performances as the fourth best guest appearances in The Simpsons history. In the Star Trek Deep Space Nine episode Trials and Tribble ations , Benjamin Sisko is interviewed by Federation Department of Temporal Investigations agents Dulmer and Lucsly, anagrams of Mulder and Scully, respectively. The pair were later expanded upon in Christopher L. Bennett's book Watching the Clock. The X Files has also been parodied or referenced in countless other shows, like 3rd Rock from the Sun, Archer, NewsRadio, American Horror Story, The Big Bang Theory, Bones, Breaking Bad, Californication, Castle, Family Guy, Hey Arnold , King of the Hill, South Park, and Two and a Half Men. Welsh music act Catatonia released the 1998 single Mulder and Scully , which became a hit in the United Kingdom. American singer and songwriter Bree Sharp wrote a song called David Duchovny about the actor in 1999 that heavily references the show and its characters. Although never a mainstream hit, the song became popular underground and gained a cult following. The series has also been referenced in The Bad Touch by the Bloodhound Gang, A Change by Sheryl Crow, Year 2000 by Xzibit, and One Week by Barenaked Ladies. Carter, Duchovny and Anderson celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson discussed Scully's influence on female fans, relating that a number of women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again. The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the I Want to Believe poster from Mulder's office.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files
"The X Files also known as The X Files Fight the Future is a 1998 American science fiction thriller based on Chris Carter's television series The X Files, which revolves around fictional unsolved cases called the X Files and the characters solving them. It was directed by Rob Bowman, written by Carter and Frank Spotnitz and featured five main characters from the television series David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, John Neville, and William B. Davis reprise their respective roles as FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner, Well Manicured Man, and the Cigarette Smoking Man. The film was promoted with the tagline Fight the Future. The film takes place between seasons five episode The End and six episode The Beginning of the television series, and is based upon the series' extraterrestrial mythology. The story follows agents Mulder and Scully, removed from their usual jobs on the X Files, and investigating the bombing of a building and the destruction of criminal evidence. They uncover what appears to be a government conspiracy attempting to hide the truth about an alien colonization of Earth. Carter decided to make a feature film to explore the show's mythology on a wider scale, as well as appealing to non fans. He wrote the story with Frank Spotnitz at the end of 1996 and, with a budget from 20th Century Fox, filming began in 1997, following the end of the show's fourth season. Carter assembled cast and crew from the show, as well as some other, well known actors such as Blythe Danner and Martin Landau, to begin production on what they termed Project Blackwood . The film was produced by Carter and Daniel Sackheim. Mark Snow continued his role as X Files composer to create the film's score. The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although some enjoyed the style and effects of the film, others found the plot confusing and viewed it as little more than an extended episode of the series. A sequel, titled I Want to Believe, was released ten years later. The film opens in 35,000 B.C., in what will become North Texas. Two cavemen hunters encounter a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the bodies of the boy and the firefighters. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate. Mulder and Scully are later chastised because, in addition to Michaud, four other people were in the building during the bombing. That evening Mulder is accosted by a paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil, who explains that the victims were already dead, and that the bombing was staged to cover up how they died. At the hospital morgue, Scully is able to examine one of the victims, finding evidence of an alien virus. Meanwhile, the Cigarette Smoking Man goes to Texas, where Dr. Ben Bronschweig shows him one of the lost firefighters, who has an alien organism residing inside his body. He orders Bronschweig to administer a vaccine to it, but to burn the body if it fails. Later, the alien organism unexpectedly gestates and kills Bronschweig. Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas, encountering the boys whose friend fell into the hole. Following their direction, they find the site has been hastily turned into a new playground. The pair follow some white gasoline tankers to a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes. Inside the domes, grates in the floor open and swarms of bees fly out. The agents flee, chased by black helicopters, but manage to escape. After returning to Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing, after which she is transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, weakening fast she quickly falls unconsciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but the driver of the ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered. Mulder finds Scully underground in Antarctica, in a large facility containing many humans in ice like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him. At another crop outpost in Tunisia, the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Conrad Strughold that Mulder remains a threat, as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X files unit has been re opened. After five successful seasons, Chris Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story for which the viewer would not need to be familiar with the show's setting and the various story arcs. Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major parts of the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and sketching out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote about half of the 124 page screenplay for the film. Carter gave 90 pages of the screenplay to Fox who received it well. While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when and where it would be filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of The X Files and directed several episodes in the first two seasons. The X Files marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles. During production, the filmmakers went to great lengths to preserve secrecy, including printing the script on red paper to prevent photocopying, and leaking disinformation to the media and giving the film the codename Project Blackwood . The code was cracked by fans who speculated on the meaning behind it. During the North Texas scene, Blackwood County can be seen on the fire trucks responding to the infected boy. According to Spotnitz, Blackwood held no particular significance. At the beginning of the pre production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, Jurassic Park. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff membersbut not to take it away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began. Both Carter and Spotnitz wanted to make the film bigger than the series, so they decided to start and end the film at an extreme place and explain aspects of the story arc that the show had not. While gathering research materials, they learned that the Earth was once covered with ice and decided to open the film in Texas in 35,000 BC with human Primitives as the first characters to appear. The film included known actors from the show such as David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner and William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man, as well as new actors and characters to the franchise. These included Martin Landau and Blythe Danner. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for The X Files. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable As soon as you put in an actor whose face is very recognizable, you've got a situation that works against the reality of the show. He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered Glenne Headly the small role of a bartender. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically. Chris Nowak was hired as production designer for the film by Daniel Sackheim. Nowak was a former architect who had worked as a professional theater set designer for eight years, before moving towards the film business as an art director. Nowak had previously worked with Sackheim on a television production, which led to Sackheim contacting him to do an interview for the selection of a production designer. According to Sackheim, Nowak was hired because he was the only one able to create a focused vision for the film. Nowak wanted to start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers so that he could formulate a sense of the atmosphere which they wanted to create for the film. He wanted to create a dark, scary and oppressive environment for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation for his role in the production. Explaining this decision, he said, I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. Of course, there were some elements from the show that had to be retained. The design department found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by input from the filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts and sent them to Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to Chris Carter, Rob Bowman, Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork. Once the set concepts were approved by Carter, Bowman, Sackheim and Ryan, they were sent to the blueprint stage so that construction of the sets could begin under the supervision of construction coordinator Bill Liams. All the major sets were constructed simultaneously because of the schedule. However, this proved to be a challenge for the production team, because it meant they had to pay the rent on all the stages at the same time. The set construction started seven weeks before filming. Carter and Bowman wanted to film in as many different locations as possible to give the film a grander feel than had usually been achievable for the television episodes. The tighter schedule, with only eight weeks of pre production and 45 days of principal photography, still caused the production to have less location shooting than planned. Los Angeles ended up standing in for Dallas and London though a shot was done in London with a double , and the ice scenes, initially envisaged for an ice field in Alaska, were moved to Whistler, British Columbia, nearby the show's regular locations in Vancouver. Principal photography for the film started on June 16, 1997. The X Files was filmed in the hiatus between the show's fourth and fifth seasons and re shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season. Due to the demands of the film shoot on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season did not revolve around both Mulder and Scully but just one of the two lead stars. Two soundtracks, The X Files Original Motion Picture Score and The X Files The Album were both released to home markets in 1998. The X Files The Album included a take on the original theme song by the American duo The Dust Brothers, and included a hidden track on which Chris Carter details a summary of The X Files mythology. Mark Snow, who had worked on the television series as a composer, was hired to score the film. Chris Carter wanted a very minimal approach to the music. He did not want much melody and wanted to replace it with plain ambient atmosphere and sound design . Snow mixed electronic music with an 85 member orchestra to give the film a great sense of scope and grandeur. When creating the music for the film, Snow had a couple of months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked the first time in the history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators. The film premiered theatrically in the United States as well as Canada on June 19, 1998, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It closed after 14 weeks, with its widest release having been 2,650 theaters. The same year as the international theatrical release, the film was released on VHS on October 13, 1998 in an Extended Cut edition that is 41 seconds longer than the theatrical release. The film made its first appearance on DVD on January 24, 2000 in Region 2 and on January 16, 2001 in Region 1. In 2008, producer Frank Spotnitz announced plans to release a new special edition DVD and Blu ray edition of the film. We are working on packing the re issued DVD and Blu ray releases with as many extras as they will fit, including video and audio commentaries, behind the scenes footage, bloopers, trailers, a new documentary, and several other cool surprises. The Blu ray version was released on December 2, 2008. In addition, a novelization of the film was written by Elizabeth Hand and released on June 19, 1998. The film grossed 83,898,313 in the U.S. and 105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of 189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned 30,138,758 which was 35.9 of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at No. 23 for all films released in the U.S. in 1998 and No. 10 for PG 13 rated films released that year. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 65 based on reviews from 72 critics, with an average rating of 6.1 10. The consensus states, Results may vary for newcomers, but fans of the series will enjoy its big screen transition. On Metacritic the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F. Tim Goodman, writing for The San Francisco Examiner Roger Ebert gave a positive review of the film with three out of four stars, saying, As pure movie, The X Files more or less works. As a story, it needs a sequel, a prequel, and Cliff Notes. Joyce Millman of Salon was more equivocal, writing, ... You really can't treat The X Files as a movie because it isn't one. It's a two hour episode of the show, and said it was far from the most satisfying of X Files releases. San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Bob Graham was positive towards the film, calling David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson ... enormously sympathetic heroes. Michael O'Sullivan, a reviewer from The Washington Post called the film, stylish, scary, sardonically funny and at times just plain gross. Los Angeles Times reviewer Kenneth Turan felt that it was difficult to make sense of the film, saying that it relied too heavily on the series' mythology. Lisa Alspector wrote that Only two scenes in this spin off are worth the time of followers of the TV series. Variety reviewer Todd McCarthy remarked, As it is, the pic serves up set pieces and a measure of scope that are beyond TV size but remain rather underwhelming by feature standards. Janet Maslin of The New York Times responded negatively towards the film, complaining that it was uneventful and scorning the hush hush atmosphere surrounding the production. Andrew Johnston reviewed the film in Time Out New York and observed The X Files has always been the most cinematic show on TV, and Bowman who's directed many of its best episodes expands the show's scale and impact on the big screen while keeping its charms intact. The X Files has spawned one sequel, a 2008 film entitled The X Files I Want to Believe released six years after the series ended. The film performed modestly at the box office and received a less positive response than the first film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chris Carter announced that if I Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose that a third film go back to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. No third film appeared instead, the TV series was revived in 2016.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%20%28film%29
"The X Files The Album is a 1998 soundtrack album released to accompany the film The X Files. Released on June 2, 1998, the album features songs by various artists, including several who had contributed to the earlier album Songs in the Key of X Music from and Inspired by the X Files, and consists mostly of cover versions or reworkings of earlier material. The X Files The Album received mostly positive criticism upon its release, and charted in several countries worldwide, recording a peak position of number 5 in New Zealand. Although The X Files The Album is the soundtrack to the 1998 film The X Files, only one of the album's songs Crystal Ship by Xis actually heard during the film, briefly playing on a jukebox during a brief scene. The album's producer, David Was, intended to match the film's tone rather than using the songs as content, leading to several of the artists involved contributing material which would seem uncharacteristically eerie compared to their usual work. Many of the songs on The X Files The Album are cover versions or reworkings of earlier materialsinger Sting collaborated with the group Aswad to perform a reggae cover of Invisible Sun , which he had earlier recorded with The Police Filter's One is a rearrangement of a song made famous by Three Dog Night while Foo Fighters contributed a new version of their song Walking After You . All but one of the album's tracks are exclusive to the soundtrack, with Bjork's Hunter having been previously released on the 1997 album Homogenic. Several of the artists on the album's rosterFoo Fighters, Filter and Soul Coughinghad previously contributed material to Songs in the Key of X Music from and Inspired by the X Files, the soundtrack album which accompanied the television series however, Chris Carter, creator of The X Files, stated before the album's release that although there are some similarities between the records, there are different artists and a different flavor . The inclusion of a track by the group Ween was spurred by fact that The X Files star David Duchovny had first met then wife Tea Leoni through their mutual appreciation for the group while The Cranberries were approached about contributing material after Carter saw them performing on a tour of the United States. The Filter cover of One was deliberately constructed by Was once he realized that Duchovny had ad libbed the song's opening line during one of the film's scenes. The album's final tracka cover by Dust Brothers of Mark Snow's opening theme for the television seriesfeatures a hidden track which plays after a period of silence. The track features a spoken word segment by Carter which explains the series' overarching mythology up to the film's release. The European and Japanese releases include an extra track, Tubular X by Mike Oldfield. This is a variation of Mark Snow's The X Files Theme incorporating elements of Oldfield's Tubular Bells. The X Files The Album was first released on June 2, 1998, with international releases occurring between July and October that same year. The soundtrack appeared in several charts upon its release, reaching a peak position of 26 in the United States' Billboard 200 albums chart, 21 in Austria's O3 Austria Top 40, 27 in Australia's ARIA Charts, and 5its highest chart positionin the Official New Zealand Music Chart. The X Files The Album has received generally positive reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the soundtrack four stars out of five, calling it the best alt rock soundtrack of the summer of 1998 . Erlewine felt that the album was more polished and well produced than Songs in the Key of X however, he noted that this came at the expense of the earlier record's quirky and off kilter aesthetic. Erlewine singled out Beacon Light and Hunter as particular highlights of the album. Jim Rogatis of the Chicago Sun Times rated the album one and a half stars out of four, finding the album to be predictable and phone in he highlighted the songs by Filter, Foo Fighters, Bjork and Ween to be particular low points for him. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Brown rated the album a B, finding that it isnt eccentric enough compared to the film or series. Browne found that the contributions by Noel Gallagher and Ween matched the tone of The X Files, but felt that Tonic, Filter, Sting and Aswad had been included out of commercial rather than artistic interest. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club considered the soundtrack to be less interesting than the accompanying film score, finding the album's roster to be formulaic and several of its tracks to not be particularly revelatory or radical .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files%3A%20The%20Album
"X Flight is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois. Designed and built by Bolliger Mabillard, the ride opened as the fourth Wing Coaster in the world and the second in the United States on May 16, 2012. It replaced both the Splashwater Falls and Great American Raceway attractions. The 3,000 foot long 910 m roller coaster features barrel rolls, high speed drops, and a signature fly through element, where the train narrowly misses a support structure designed to look like an air traffic control tower as it passes through an opening known as a keyhole element. X Flight was announced on September 1, 2011. Six Flags Great America was the first park to announce plans for a Wing Coaster in the United States. Land clearing started in September 2011 on the former site of Splashwater Falls and the Great America Raceway. The first pieces of the track began to arrive in early October. 127 Caissons footers , ranging from 30 feet 9.1 m to 77 feet 23 m were dug into the ground. On January 27, 2012, the final piece of the lift hill was topped off. The trains for X Flight arrived at the park on March 2, 2012. In a Chicago Sun Times article in February, the park said they expect safety tests to start in early April. X Flight opened for Xclusive season pass holders on the weekend of May 12 and opened to the public on May 16. ... It'll be like riding on the wing of a plane. After departing from the station, which resembles an airplane hangar, the train immediately begins to climb the steep 120 foot 37 m chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the train enters the first element of the roller coaster, a Dive Drop. This element is similar to the Dive Drop's found on The Swarm at Thorpe Park and GateKeeper at Cedar Point and consists of the train rotating 180 degrees into an upside down position before descending back to the ground. During this drop, the train reaches its top speed of 55 miles per hour 89 km h . At the bottom of the first drop, riders get their picture taken. After the train exits the first drop, the train then enters a zero g roll before going through a cloud of fog. The train then makes a slight left turn before entering an Immelmann loop followed by a right turn over a pond. The train then leads into the second zero g roll over the main entrance of the ride. Following the roll, the train makes a left turn before going through an Inline twist. During this element, which is known as a keyhole, riders go through an actual airplane control tower which was retrieved from O'Hare International Airport , giving the illusion the train will hit the tower. After going through the tower, the train goes through another near miss keyhole surrounded by a cloud of fog, before exiting the twist and making a tight right turn, passing by Demon's corkscrews and last turn, before making a slight left upward turn leading into the Main Brake. The train then makes a 180 degree left turn into the Slowdown Brake and the Transfer Track before entering the station. One cycle lasts about 1 minute and 15 seconds. X Flight is a Wing Coaster model from Swiss manufacturer, Bolliger Mabillard. It was the fifth B M coaster for Six Flags Great America. X Flight joins the inverted roller coaster, Batman The Ride, the hyper twister, Raging Bull and the flying roller coaster, Superman Ultimate Flight, giving the park a total of four operating coasters from B M. The park's first B M coaster, Iron Wolf was moved to Six Flags America at the end of the 2011 season. X Flight was the fourth Wing Coaster built and the second in the United States, preceded by Wild Eagle at Dollywood. X Flight operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars with four seats per car two on each side of the track for a total of 32 riders per train. The colors of the train are red and black with over the shoulder restraints. The restraints are similar to the restraints found on Superman Ultimate Flight. The steel track is approximately 3,000 feet 910 m in length and the height of the lift is approximately 120 feet 37 m . The track is colored red while the supports are black. X Flight has received mostly positive reviews. Doug George from the Chicago Tribune stated the ride is very smooth with rolls, dives and inverted, eye bugging flips. However, he stated that the ride is pretty short and with only one train running the course at a time, the wait time can reach as long as other popular attractions at the park. The Coaster Critic reviewed the ride and stated that the theming is very well done, especially the keyhole element. He said the different seating set up encourages re rides because of the different experience on each side of the train. Overall, he gave the ride a 9 out of 10 because of the riding position, loops, and interactions or near misses.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Flight%20%28Six%20Flags%20Great%20America%29

Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe praised the first three X Men films as more than a cash guzzling wham bang Hollywood franchise ... these three movies sport philosophy, ideas, a telethon load of causes, and a highly elastic us versus them allegory. Morris praised X Men The Last Stand for put the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position. Realism at this time of year How unorthodox Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews, but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating their powers are so various and ill matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas. The first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone. However, when director Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt Singer's sensitivity to made the first two X Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic based summer extravaganzas ... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang ups. James Berardinelli felt, X Men The Last Stand isn't as taut or satisfying as X Men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original X Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however despite the change in directors, there seems to be a single vision. David Denby of The New Yorker praised the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work , but called Ratner's film a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes. Singer's third film in the series, X Men Days of Future Past was also well received. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down . Spider Man director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series, particularly Singer's films. Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared Batman Begins to Singer's films. Logan was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. There was criticism of the large cast, and the limited screentime for all of them. Richard George of IGN reacted well to the depictions of Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey, Storm, William Stryker, Mystique, Beast and Nightcrawler however, George thought many of the younger X Men characters, such as Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, Angel and Kitty Pryde were adjectiveless teenager , and was disappointed by Cyclops' characterization. He observed the filmmakers were big fans of silent henchmen , due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants such as Lady Deathstrike and Psylocke. While Jesse Schedeen of IGN, stated that the continuity of the films doesn't make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation, different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films. He also criticized 20th Century Fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning. In his review of Dark Phoenix, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal characterized the entire X Men film series as being a notoriously erratic franchise. Richard George of IGN stated that the success of the first X Men film paved the way for comic book film adaptations such as the Spider Man series, Fantastic Four 2005 , V for Vendetta and Singer's Superman Returns. Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine called the first X Men film as the catalyst for films based on Marvel Comics characters, stating Singer's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that's come since, good and bad. Without it, there's no Marvel Studios. Comic book writer Mark Millar said that Singer's X Men revolutionized superhero films. Rebecca Rubin of Variety magazine stated that the X Men franchise has proven there is an audience for a hardline superhero film, while Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations said that with films like the Deadpool films and Logan, the studios can do more with an R rated film and give the audience something new. However, Tim Grierson and Will Leitch of New York magazine's Vulture criticized the series, noting that the best films of the series failed to capture the zeitgeist the way Marvel Cinematic Universe films did. As of May 2014, the DVD and Blu ray sales of the first six films in the United States earned more than 620 million. 20th Century Fox had multiple films planned in various stages of development. They included In March 2019, The Walt Disney Company acquired the film rights for the X Men after the acquisition deal of 21st Century Fox was completed. The films in development under 20th Century Fox were placed on hold and eventually cancelled by Disney. Any future X Men films will be under the supervision of Marvel Studios, with The New Mutants serving as the final film in 20th Century Fox's X Men film series.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%20%28film%20series%29
"X Men is a 2000 American superhero film directed by Bryan Singer and written by David Hayter from a story by Singer and Tom DeSanto. The film is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name and features an ensemble cast consisting of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ray Park, and Anna Paquin. The film depicts a world where a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. It focuses on mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutant kind Professor Xavier's X Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. Development of X Men began as far back as 1984 with Orion Pictures, with James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow in discussions at one point. The film rights were bought by 20th Century Fox in 1994, and various scripts and film treatments were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon, and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie, and Hayter, in which Beast and Nightcrawler were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. X Men marked the Hollywood debut for Jackman, a last second choice for Wolverine, cast three weeks into filming. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto. X Men premiered at Ellis Island on July 12, 2000, and was released in the United States on July 14, 2000. It was a box office success, grossing over 296.3 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics, citing its performances, story, and thematic depth. The film's success led to a series of sequels, prequels, and spin offs, with the overall success of the series spawning a reemergence of superhero films, a genre that would remain highly popular for the next two decades. In Nazi occupied Poland, 12 year old Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his parents upon entering the Auschwitz concentration camp. While trying to reach them, he causes a set of metal gates to bend towards him as the result of his mutant ability to create magnetic fields and control metal manifesting, only to be knocked out by the guards. In the not too distant future, U.S. Senator Robert Kelly attempts to pass a Mutant Registration Act in Congress, which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. Present are Lehnsherr, now going by the name Magneto , and his telepathic colleague Professor Charles Xavier. Seeing Lehnsherr in attendance, Xavier becomes concerned with how he will respond to the Registration Act. Meanwhile, in Meridian, Mississippi, 17 year old Marie D'Ancanto accidentally puts her boyfriend into a coma upon kissing him as the result of her mutant ability to absorb the powers and life force of others. She runs away from home and adopts the name Rogue. In Alberta, she meets Logan, also known as Wolverine, a mutant who possesses superhuman healing abilities and metal claws that protrude from between his knuckles. While on the road together, they are attacked by a minion of Magneto's, Sabretooth, until two of Xavier's students Cyclops and Storm arrive and save them. Wolverine and Rogue are brought to Xavier's mansion and school for mutants in Westchester County, New York. Xavier tells Logan that Magneto appears to have taken an interest in Wolverine and asks him to stay while Xavier's mutants, the X Men, investigate the matter. Meanwhile, Rogue enrolls in the school. Senator Kelly is abducted by two more of Magneto's minions, Toad and Mystique, and is brought to their hideout on the uncharted island of Genosha. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of radiation, inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes by taking advantage of his newfound mutation. Rogue visits Wolverine during the night while he is having a nightmare however, he accidentally stabs her once startled, but Rogue is able to absorb his healing ability to recover, which other students witness, having arrived to help. She is later convinced by Mystique, who disguises herself as Rogue's crush Bobby Drake, that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant locating machine Cerebro to find Rogue at a train station, and the X Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it. Having left ahead of Storm and Cyclops, Wolverine finds Rogue on a train and convinces her to return to the school. Before they can leave, Magneto arrives, knocks out Wolverine and subdues Rogue. Although Xavier attempts to stop Magneto by mentally controlling Sabretooth, he is forced to release his hold on Sabretooth when Magneto threatens the police who have converged on the train station, allowing Magneto's Brotherhood to escape with Rogue. Kelly arrives at Xavier's school, and Xavier reads his mind to learn about Magneto's machine. Realizing the strain of powering it nearly killed Magneto, the group deduces he intends to transfer his powers to Rogue and use her to power it at the cost of her life. Kelly's body rejects his mutation, and his body dissolves into liquid. Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro, but Mystique's sabotage incapacitates him, and he falls into a coma. Fellow telekinetic and telepath Jean Grey fixes Cerebro and uses it, learning that Magneto plans to place his mutation inducing machine on Liberty Island and use it to mutate the world leaders meeting at a summit on nearby Ellis Island. The X Men scale the Statue of Liberty, battling the Brotherhood while Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue and activates the mutating machine. As Wolverine confronts and distracts Magneto, Cyclops blasts him away, allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. He transfers his powers to Rogue and his healing abilities rejuvenate her, while incapacitating himself. Professor Xavier and Wolverine recover from their comas. The group also learns that Mystique escaped the island battle and is impersonating Senator Kelly. Xavier gives Wolverine a lead to his past at an abandoned military installation in Canada. Magneto is imprisoned in a complex constructed of plastic and is visited by Xavier, and Magneto warns him he intends to escape one day and continue the fight. Additionally, Shawn Ashmore appeared in a minor role as Bobby Drake Iceman, a mutant student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters who takes a liking to Rogue. His powers include generating ice. David Hayter, Stan Lee, and Tom DeSanto make cameo appearances. George Buza, the voice of Beast in X Men The Animated Series, appeared as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine fights. Other cameo appearances include Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde, Katrina Florece as Jubilee, Donald MacKinnon as a young Colossus sketching a picture in one scene, and Alexander Burton as Pyro. Gambit was considered for one of the students at the X Mansion. Singer remembered, We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, but the feeling was that, if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs ' Kevin Feige had a cameo as a Weapon X tech, but his scenes did not make the final cut of the film. Marvel Comics writers and chief editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas wrote an X Men screenplay in 1984 when Orion Pictures held an option on the film rights, but development stalled when Orion began facing financial troubles. Throughout 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were in discussions with Carolco Pictures for an X Men film adaptation, with James Cameron as producer and Kathryn Bigelow directing. A story treatment was written by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins being considered for Wolverine and Angela Bassett being considered for the role of Storm. The deal fell apart when Stan Lee piqued Cameron's interest on a Spider Man film, Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights reverting to Marvel. In December 1992, Marvel discussed selling the property to Columbia Pictures to no avail. Meanwhile, Avi Arad produced the animated X Men TV series for Fox Kids. 20th Century Fox was impressed by the success of the TV show, and producer Lauren Shuler Donner purchased the film rights for them in 1994, bringing Andrew Kevin Walker to write the script. Walker's draft involved Professor Xavier recruiting Wolverine into the X Men, which consists of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman, Beast, and Angel. The Brotherhood of Mutants, which consisted of Magneto, Sabretooth, Toad, Juggernaut and the Blob, try to conquer New York City, while Henry Peter Gyrich and Bolivar Trask attack the X Men with three 8 feet 2.4 m tall Sentinels. The script focused on the rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, as well as the latter's self doubt as a field leader. Part of the backstory invented for Magneto made him the cause of the Chernobyl disaster. The script also featured the X Copter and the Danger Room. Walker turned in his second draft in June 1994. Laeta Kalogridis, John Logan, James Schamus, and Joss Whedon were brought on for subsequent rewrites. One of these scripts kept the idea of Magneto turning Manhattan into a mutant homeland , while another hinged on a romance between Wolverine and Storm. Whedon's draft featured the Danger Room, and concluded with Jean Grey dressed as the Phoenix. According to Entertainment Weekly, this screenplay was rejected because of its quick witted pop culture referencing tone , and the finished film contained only two dialogue exchanges that Whedon had contributed. Michael Chabon pitched a six page film treatment to Fox in 1996. It focused heavily on character development between Wolverine and Jubilee and included Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Beast, Iceman, and Storm. Under Chabon's plan, the villains would not have been introduced until the second film. Fox considered Brett Ratner as director Ratner would go on to direct X Men The Last Stand , and offered the position to Robert Rodriguez, but he turned it down. After the commercial success of Mortal Kombat in the United States, Paul W. S. Anderson was offered the position but turned it down, wanting to shift away from making another PG 13 rated film in favour of making an R rated horror film, Event Horizon. Following the release of The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was looking to do a science fiction film and Fox offered him Alien Resurrection, but producer Tom DeSanto felt he would be more appropriate for X Men. The themes of prejudice in the comic resonated with Singer. By December 1996, Singer was in the director's position, while Ed Solomon was hired to write the script in April 1997, and Singer went to film Apt Pupil. Fox then announced a Christmas 1998 release date. In late 1997, the budget was projected at 60 million. In 1998, Claremont returned to Marvel and, seeing how Fox was still struggling with the script, sent them a four page long memo where he explained the core concepts and what differentiated the X Men from other superheroes. In late 1998, Singer and DeSanto sent a treatment to Fox, which they believed was perfect because it took seriously the themes and the comparisons between Xavier and Magneto and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, unlike the other scripts. They made Rogue an important character because Singer recognized that her mutation, which renders her unable to touch anyone, was the most symbolic of alienation. Singer merged attributes of Kitty Pryde and Jubilee into the film's depiction of Rogue. Magneto's plot to mutate the world leaders into accepting his people is reminiscent of how Constantine I's conversion to Christianity ended the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire the analogy was emphasized in a deleted scene in which Storm teaches history. Senator Kelly's claim that he has a list of mutants living in the United States recalls Joseph McCarthy's similar claim regarding communists. Fox, who had projected the budget at 75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated would have cost 5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X Men. Fox head Bill Mechanic argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The Usual Suspects, and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit. The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was more in line with Hayter's script than his. Russell Crowe was Singer's first choice to play Wolverine, but he turned it down, instead recommending his friend, actor Hugh Jackman for the part. Jackman was an unknown actor at the time, while a number of more established actors offered their services for the role, with Singer casting Dougray Scott. Part of Scott's contract included a sequel, but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with Mission Impossible 2 in early October 1999 and was injured in a motorbike accident. Jackman was then cast three weeks into filming, based on a successful audition. Glenn Danzig was invited by 20th Century Fox to audition for the role of Wolverine, as his height and build closely resemble that of the film's protagonist, as described in the original comic books. However, he declined due to scheduling conflicts with his band. Keanu Reeves, Gary Sinise, Mel Gibson, Aaron Eckhart, Jean Claude Van Damme, Viggo Mortensen, Edward Norton and Bob Hoskins were also considered for the role of Wolverine. Jeri Ryan was in the running for the role of Mystique. Patrick Stewart was first approached by Singer to play Xavier on the set of Conspiracy Theory 1997 , which was directed by X Men Executive Producer Richard Donner. Jim Caviezel was originally cast as Cyclops, but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with Frequency. James Marsden was unfamiliar with his character, but he soon became accustomed after reading various comic books. Marsden modeled his performance similar to a Boy Scout. Eric Mabius expressed interest for the role of Cyclops. Angela Bassett was the studio's first choice to portray Storm, but she was too expensive to cast at the time. Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey were also considered for the role of Storm. Anna Paquin dropped out of the lead role in Tart in favor of X Men. Drew Barrymore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Katie Holmes, Christina Ricci, Alicia Silverstone and Katharine Isabelle were considered for the role of Rogue, although Natalie Portman turned it down. Selma Blair, Renee O'Connor, Lucy Lawless and Maria Bello were considered for the role of Jean Grey. Peta Wilson was offered the role of Jean Grey, but had to film the fourth season of La Femme Nikita 1997 instead and Helen Hunt was asked to play Jean Grey, but she turned down the role. David Hemblen, Christopher Lee and Terence Stamp were considered for Magneto before Singer cast Ian McKellen, who had acted in his previous film, Apt Pupil. McKellen responded to the gay allegory of the film, the allegory of the mutants as outsiders, disenfranchised and alone and coming to all of that at puberty when their difference manifests, Singer explained. Ian is an activist and he really responded to the potential of that allegory. The original start date was mid 1999, with the release date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X Men to June. Steven Spielberg had been scheduled to film Minority Report for release in June 2000, but he had chosen to film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Fox needed a film to fill the void. This meant that Singer had to finish X Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had been pushed back. The release date was then moved to July 14. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000 in Toronto and in Hamilton, Ontario. Locations included Central Commerce Collegiate, Distillery District and Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum. Casa Loma, Roy Thomson Hall and Metro Hall were used for X Mansion interiors, while Parkwood Estate located in Oshawa, east of Toronto was chosen for exteriors. Spencer Smith Park in Burlington, Ontario doubled for Liberty Island. Post production was hectic, with Shuler Donner saying that we had to lock picture and score and edit, sometimes at the same time. The filmmakers decided not to replicate the X Men costumes as seen in the comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, you can do that on a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing Producer co writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line What would you prefer, yellow spandex when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniformsduring filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them blend into the night . Oakley, Inc. provided the red lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized version of the company's own X Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca Romijn Stamos wore 110 individual silicone prosthetics on her body to portray Mystique only the edges were glued, the rest were self sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, but at the last minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added six hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, I had almost no contact with the rest of the cast it was like I was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell. In the late 1990s, computer generated imagery was becoming more commonly used. Singer visited the sets of Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace and Titanic to understand practical and digital effects. Filming had started without a special effects company hired. Digital Domain, Cinesite, Kleiser Walczak Construction Co., Hammerhead Production, Matte World Digital, CORE and POP were all hired in December 1999. Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink admitted to have been dissatisfied with his work on X Men in 2003, despite nearly being nominated for an Academy Award. Digital Domain's technical director Sean C. Cunningham and lead compositor Claas Henke morphed Bruce Davison into a liquid figure for Kelly's mutation scene. Cunningham said, There were many digital layers water without refraction, water with murkiness, skin with and without highlights, skin with goo in it. When rendered together, it took 39 hours per frame. They considered showing Kelly's internal organs during the transformation, but that seemed too gruesome , according to Cunningham. Singer approached John Williams to compose the film score, but Williams turned down the offer because of scheduling conflicts. Then Singer set on his usual composer, John Ottman. However, once Fox pushed X Men from December to July, Ottman's commitment to direct Urban Legends Final Cut made him unable to work with Singer. Michael Kamen was eventually hired. Given the film was only completed shortly before its premiere, Kamen wrote the score to the finished scenes, which were sent to him just as work was done on them. Singer asked him not to use any songs in the soundtrack as he didn't want to date the movie . Due to Kamen's unfamiliarity with the comics, he only tried to represent Bryan Singer's filmic tone that he's made, for a comic book, a quite serious movie, which is about the capacity of humanity to categorize people by race, religion or type, and prejudice people against them based on their innate characteristics . Character specific themes were written to identify these characters, as you go through the film, because they're not always clear. For instance, Mystique's motif, focused on the cello as Kamen found it a very erotic sounding instrument , played in the soundtrack as she was disguised as Wolverine. Due to time restrictions, the producers scrapped their original plan to record the score in London and did it in Los Angeles. Kamen's first draft of the score had been described as having an abundance of themes and rich orchestrations. During early recording sessions, producer Lauren Shuler Donner expressed her dissatisfaction with Kamen's music and forced him to rewrite the entire score by using fewer themes and more electronic elements. Fox Broadcasting Company aired a special entitled Mutant Watch to promote the movie that partially includes in universe scenes of a senate hearing featuring Senator Robert Kelly. This featurette was included as a bonus feature on some of the video releases. On June 1, 2000, Marvel published a comic book prequel to X Men, entitled X Men Beginnings, revealing the backstories of Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine. There was also a comic book adaptation based on the film. A console video game, X Men Mutant Academy, was released on July 6, 2000 to take advantage of the film's release, featuring costumes and other materials from the film. X Men had its premiere at Ellis Island on July 12, 2000, two days before a wide opening in 3,025 theaters in North America. It would also debut in Australia that weekend to take advantage of the school holidays, while most other territories would get the film in August. Marvel Studios was depending on X Men's success to ignite other franchise properties Spider Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Daredevil . X Men grossed 157.3 million in the United States and Canada and 139 million in other territories for a worldwide total of 296.3 million, against a production budget of 75 million, becoming the eighth highest grossing film of 2000 domestically and ninth worldwide. In North America, X Men opened on Friday, July 14, 2000, and made 20.8 million on its opening day. The film earned 54.5 million in its opening weekend, averaging 18,007 per theater, and having the highest grossing opening weekend for a superhero film surpassing Batman Forever's 52.7 million , a non sequel and a July release surpassing Men in Black's 51.1 million . At the time of its release, X Men had the sixth biggest opening of all time and marked the first time in history that three pictures had consecutive opening weekends above 40 million in North America, after The Perfect Storm's 41.3 million and Scary Movie's 42.3 million. The success of X Men started a reemergence for the comic book and superhero film genre. X Men received positive reviews from critics. Based on 171 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 81 were positive with an average score of 7.06 10. The site's critical consensus reads Faithful to the comics and filled with action, X Men brings a crowded slate of classic Marvel characters to the screen with a talented ensemble cast and surprisingly sharp narrative focus. Metacritic collected an average score of 64 100 from 33 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews . Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of A on a scale of A to F. Kenneth Turan found so much is happening you feel the immediate need of a sequel just as a reward for absorbing it all. While X Men doesn't take your breath away wire to wire the way The Matrix did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it. ReelReviews.net's James Berardinelli, an X Men comic book fan, believed, the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure . Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented, he movie's enjoyable on the surface, but I suspect many people, even die hards, will be less enthusiastic about what lies, or doesn't, underneath . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times said he started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it I assume the X Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions. He also gave it a thumbs down on Ebert Roeper. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, but lost to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. X Men was successful at the Saturn Awards. It won categories for Best Science Fiction Film, direction Singer , writing David Hayter , costume design, Best Actor Hugh Jackman and Supporting Actress Rebecca Romijn . Nominations included Performance by a Younger Actor Anna Paquin , Supporting Actor Patrick Stewart , Special Effects and Make up. Empire readers voted Singer Best Director. X Men was originally released on VHS and DVD on November 21, 2000, to take advantage of Thanksgiving in the United States. In its initial home video weekend, the film earned 60 million in rentals and direct sales, making it earn more than all films in theaters outside from leader How the Grinch Stole Christmas. X Men finished 2000 as the seventh highest grossing home release of the year with 141 million, with 78 being earned through sales. A new two disc DVD version was issued in 2003 in anticipation to the theatrical release of sequel X2, titled X Men 1.5. The DVD includes the theatrical version of the film along with the option to add deleted scenes, and several new additional features. X Men was released on Blu ray in April 2009, with bonus features reproduced from the X Men 1.5 DVD release. Unlike the US edition, the UK release of the Blu ray includes a picture in picture mode called BonusView , and an in feature photo gallery. After the film's critical and financial success, a series of films followed starting with, X2 2003 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%20%28film%29
"X Men The Last Stand often promoted as X3 is a 2006 superhero film based on the X Men superhero team introduced in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to 2003's X2, as well as the third installment in the X Men film series, and was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. It features an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammer, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Vinnie Jones, and Patrick Stewart. The film's script is loosely based on two X Men comic book story arcs The Dark Phoenix Saga by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne, and Gifted by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday, with a plot that revolves around a mutant cure that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans, and on the resurrection of Jean Grey. Bryan Singer, who had directed the two previous films, X Men 2000 and X2, decided to leave the sequel to work on Superman Returns. X2 composer John Ottman and X2 writers Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty also left to work on Superman Returns, as did James Marsden, who had very limited screen time in The Last Stand before his character was killed off due to his departure from the film. Singer had not even defined the storyline for a third film. Matthew Vaughn, who was initially hired as the new director, left due to personal and professional issues, and was replaced with Ratner. Filming took place from August 2005 to January 2006 with a budget of 210 million, and was consequently the most expensive film made at the time of its release. It had extensive visual effects created by 11 different companies. X Men The Last Stand was released on May 26, 2006, by 20th Century Fox. It grossed approximately 459 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest grossing film of 2006 it was at the time the highest grossing film in the series and currently the fourth highest grossing film of the franchise. Critical reception was mixed, with the acting, musical score and the action scenes receiving positive notice, and criticism directed at the screenplay, overuse of characters, and style. Twenty years in the past, Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr meet young Jean Grey at her parents' house to invite her to join their school, the X Mansion. Ten years later, the industrialist father of Warren Worthington III discovers his son is a mutant as Warren tries to cut off his wings. In the present, Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X gene that gives mutants their abilities and offer the cure to any mutant who wants it. The cure is created from the genome of a young mutant named Jimmy, who lives at the Worthington facility on Alcatraz Island. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the X Men's Rogue, many others are horrified by the announcement. Magneto re establishes his Brotherhood of Mutants with those who oppose the cure, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race. With help from Pyro, Magneto recruits Callisto and several other mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man. Mystique, shielding Magneto from a cure dart, is hit by it and loses her mutant abilities. Magneto abandons her as a result. Meanwhile, Scott Summers, still distraught over the loss of his fiancee Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean. When Logan and Storm return to the X Mansion, Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she also freed the Phoenix , a dark and extremely powerful alternate personality which Xavier had telepathically repressed, aware of the Phoenix's godlike destructive potential. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind but, once she awakens, he discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. The Phoenix emerges, knocks out Logan, and escapes to her childhood home. Magneto learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood. Magneto and Xavier go in, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before Magneto and Logan can stop her. Jean leaves with Magneto. After interrogating Mystique, the FBI discover Magneto's base in the woods. However, the life forms in the camp are all decoy copies of Multiple Man. Magneto and the Brotherhood have gone to storm Alcatraz by using his magnetic manipulation powers to reroute the Golden Gate Bridge. The remaining X Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood. During the fight, Kitty Pryde saves Jimmy from Juggernaut, who had been sent to kill him by Magneto. Logan has Colossus throw him at Magneto and distract him long enough for Hank McCoy to inject Magneto with the cure and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation. The Phoenix then begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and adamantium skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her, and everyone else, by killing her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, killing the Phoenix, but mourns her death. Some time later, mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints McCoy as ambassador to the United Nations. Rogue reveals to Bobby Drake that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment. Meanwhile, Magneto sits at a chessboard in San Francisco, seemingly human and weak. As he gestures toward a metal chess piece, it moves slightly. Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier's voice, leaving her startled. Other actors who portrayed mutants were Meiling Melancon as Psylocke, a mutant with the ability to teleport herself through areas of shadow, although that depiction differs significantly from the comics Omahyra Mota as Arclight, a mutant who has the ability to generate shock waves of concussive force Ken Leung as Kid Omega, a mutant with the ability to eject spikes from his body, most notably his face though the character resembles the comic books' character Quill and was later confirmed as such however, the official cast credits read Kid Omega and Cameron Bright as Jimmy Leech, a mutant who has the ability to neutralize the powers of nearby mutants. Various characters were included at the suggestion of editor Mark Helfrich, who brought Marvel's X Men Encyclopedia to director Brett Ratner, searching for mutants who could make appearance. Mark Helfrich portrays an unnamed mutant with ash gray skin. These include Phat, a mutant that is a very large man who can slim down to fit in a smaller space played by two actors, Via Saleaumua large mode and Richard Yee small mode Spike played by Lance Gibson , a mutant who battles Wolverine in the forest by extruding bony spikes from his flesh the character was added because the editing team felt that the original cut of the scene portrayed Logan as a cold blooded killer, which could be changed if another mutant attacked Wolverine before he struck the Brotherhood and Glob Herman played by Clayton Dean Watmough , a mutant with transparent skin. Various other mutants make cameos at the X Mansion Shauna Kain and Kea Wong reprised their cameo roles as Siryn and Jubilee respectively, and three identical girls in the background in one scene are a reference to the Stepford Cuckoos. Olivia Williams portrays Moira MacTaggert. X Men co creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film's opening scene as the neighbors of young Jean Grey. The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey. Lloyd Adams portrays the green skinned mutant that climbs the guard tower on Alcatraz. Many fans believed this was Toad however, the credits list him as lizard man and Brett Ratner confirmed it was Anole. Avalanche and Vanisher also appear however, it is not known who portrayed them. Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X Men films, left the project in July 2004 in favor of developing Superman Returns. Singer stated that he didn't fully have X Men 3 in my mind in contrast to a fully formed idea for a Superman film and interest in joining that franchise. By the time of his departure, Singer had only produced a partial story treatment with X2 screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, who accompanied him to Superman Returns. The treatment focused on Jean Grey's resurrection, which would also introduce the villainness Emma Frost, a role intended for Sigourney Weaver. Frost was an empath manipulating Jean's emotions in the treatment and, like the finished film, Magneto desires to control her. Overwhelmed by her powers, Jean kills herself, but Jean's spirit survives and becomes a god like creature, which Dougherty compared to the star child in A Space Odyssey. New contracts for returning cast members were made, as the actors and actresses had signed for only two films. Hugh Jackman's contract included the approval of director, initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky, with whom he had just finished filming on The Fountain. Joss Whedon, whose comic book Gifted was integrated into the script's plot, turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film. Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I, Robot. Zack Snyder was also approached, but he was already committed to 300. Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job. In February 2005, with still no director hired, Fox announced a May 5, 2006, release date, with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver. One month later, the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct, and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26, Memorial Day weekend. Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Dania Ramirez as Callisto, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began. Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox, stating that he didn't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make . Brett Ratner, who was previously considered to direct X Men in 1996, and John Moore were both in the running to replace Vaughn during pre production. On June 5, 2005, Ratner was confirmed as Vaughn's replacement. Ratner said he was surprised to get an invitation, as he thought he would have no chance to do a comic book film after the cancelled Superman Flyby for Warner Bros. With a limited knowledge of the X Men mythos, Ratner trusted his writers on doing something faithful to the comics, having the script drawing all of its scenes from the original Marvel publications. Simon Kinberg, who had worked in other two Marvel adaptations for Fox, Fantastic Four and Elektra, was hired as writer for X Men 3 in August 2004. X2 co writer Zak Penn was separately working on his own draft, and the two joined forces for a combined screenplay in January 2005. Kinberg wanted The Dark Phoenix Saga to be the emotional plot of the film, while Gifted would serve as the political focus. The duo had seven months to complete The Last Stand's script, and during the first week of work completed the first eighty pages, consisting of the first two thirds of the plot. This incomplete draft was leaked to Ain't It Cool News, who proceeded to write a negative review. The writers had to fight Fox's executives to retain the Phoenix plot, as the studio only wanted the cure story as it provided a reason for Magneto's conflict with the X Men. Still the disputes made them not add much for Jean Grey to do in most of the film's second half, as the executives considered the tone of the Phoenix story too dark for a mainstream summer movie, and that its appeal would be limited to hardcore fans rather than a general audience. Penn defended the divergences from the original Dark Phoenix stories, stating that the Phoenix was not a firebird shaped cosmic force because it doesn't fit into the world, and that Cyclops did not have as much screentime as Wolverine because the latter was more popular and with Cyclops, you can't see his eyes. It's a harder character to relate to for the audience. Killing Cyclops was Fox's decision, based on the availability of actor James Marsden, who was cast in Singer's Superman Returns. The studio considered killing him off screen with a dialogue reference, but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him, emphasizing their relationship. Xavier's death was intended to match the impact of Spock's demise in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point. Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious, but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier. They decided to write a post credits scene suggesting the character's return for a sequel. As the studio was simultaneously developing X Men Origins Wolverine, limitations were set on which mutants could be used for cameo appearances in X Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine. Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X Men, but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and not be able to do him justice. Kinberg reasoned, there just wasn't enough space , and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that there wasn't much left to do with the character. It also felt like he might tread a little bit on the terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy. Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in the tie in video game. The introductory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a Days of Future Past inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for X2. Ratner collaborated with Penn and Kinberg in rearranging the plot structure of the film. Originally, the Golden Gate Bridge sequence was in the middle of the film, where the moved bridge was used by Magneto to free mutants being held prisoners on Alcatraz, and the climax was set in Washington, D.C.. Ratner felt too many recent action films, such as Planet of the Apes and X2 itself, had their ending in Washington, and the Golden Gate sequence would be the biggest sequence in my entire career , and suggested to instead put the Worthington laboratory in Alcatraz, along with creating a face for the cure , which became the character of Jimmy Leech. Kinberg agreed, as he previously argued with Penn about blowing so many things early in the movie . X Men The Last Stand began shooting in August 2005 and wrapped in January 2006. Much of the film was shot at Vancouver Film Studios, the same location of X2. Locations included the Hatley Park National Historic Site and Royal Roads University, which doubled for the X Mansion. An old lumber mill next to the Fraser River doubled as Alcatraz Island. The tight schedule made Ratner begin post production the day I started shooting, sending the scenes he had just filmed to his editors. The editing team was led by Mark Helfrich, who had edited all of Ratner's films, assisted by Mark Goldblatt in the action scenes and Julia Wong with effects heavy footage. According to associate producer Dave Gordon, This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada. It used to be X2, now it's X3. The 210 million budget also made The Last Stand the most expensive film to be made at the time. The film's record would be first broken by Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest's 225 million budget. The original cinematographer was Philippe Rousselot, who eventually opted to depart production. Dante Spinotti, a frequent collaborator of Ratner, replaced him, with assistance of J. Michael Muro. Fox Filmed Entertainment co chairmen Thomas Rothman and Jim Gianopulos debated whether Rogue should give Iceman a passionate kiss at the film's end or simply hold his hand. The two executives screened The Last Stand for their daughters, as well as the studio's female marketing executives, and the hand holding prevailed. Gianopulos stated that the kissing was all about sex, and we didn't want that. A strong campaign of secrecy about the script was enforced by Ratner and the writers. Even the actors had problems with getting full screenplays, the call sheets did not reveal all the characters, and many scenes were shot in varied ways. Both of the ending scenes were not included on the shooting script, with Ratner taking a small crew during one day's lunch time to film the post credits scene with Xavier, and later going to London to film Magneto in the park. In 2014, Kinberg said of the wobbling chess piece at the end of the film, There is a scene before the credits where Magneto's playing chess, and you see that he can just make the chess piece move, so there's a hint that he's starting to regain his powers. The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn't work exactly the way they thought it would, and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back. To make sure the visual effects were made in just one year and without exceeding the budget, special effects supervisor John Bruno shipped the 900 effects shots to eleven companies in four countries United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada and did extensive previsualization. Their work begun in April 2005, before the director Brett Ratner had even been announced, and Bruno made sure to emphasize practical effects, shoot as many practical elements as possible, and only use CG when we had to. For instance, complex wirework rigs were employed which enabled the actors to do some stunts without resorting to digital doubles, including a computer controlled flying rig from Cirque Du Soleil for Angel's flight, and one for Halle Berry's flying spins. Bruno estimates one sixth of the effects budget was spent on the Golden Gate Bridge scene, which employed both a miniature of the bridge and computer graphics. The miniature was filmed over a period of two months in Santa Clarita, California, just outside of Los Angeles. The effects team would shoot one minute of footage outdoors each day at golden hour, complete with explosives in order to have enough plates to composite the scene.The effects team had to work without reference footage due to the city of San Francisco vetting any filming in the actual bridge, including aerial shooting as the area has restrictions on flying helicopters. Framestore had further challenges in matching the varied weather conditions across the film's plates. As compositing supervisor Matt Twyford detailed, the elements consisted of cold, rainy night live action footage from Vancouver, sunny day miniature elements, traditional misty day background plates of San Francisco, and of course the CG bridge and fx elements. Another miniature was for the Grey home, which had a destructable equivalent matched the Canadian location and also had a digital equivalent. A notable effect was the digital skin grafting , which rejuvenated the faces of senior actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, made by the Brothers Strause's Lola Visual Effects. Bruno made sure to ask the atomization made by Phoenix was not too vivid and gruesome, instead resembling oatmeal. Ratner, a fan of John Powell's work in The Bourne Identity, invited Powell to write the music for The Last Stand. Powell was unsure if the Bourne work was the kind of score that would fit the film and Fox became reluctant on the composer's availability, given he was already scoring Ice Age The Meltdown at the time of Ratner's contact. However, Powell finished the Ice Age score early to accept the X Men job even if it meant a tighter schedule. Powell included references to the score from the previous two films as it all had to be in the same family, and the same language . The Phoenix theme used lyrics from Benjamin Britten's Requiem Mass for the choir parts. A soundtrack album was released on May 23, 2006. The marketing for The Last Stand was darker and more ambiguous compared to the two predecessors. Fox president Tom Rothman declared that the decision was made so the film would be different from all of the other movies in the summer, with a campaign that wanted people to stop and not have it be so immediately apparent that we're selling a movie. We're interested in selling an emotion and an idea. The film's official website was launched in October 2005. The teaser trailer release with King Kong the following December was done in conjunction with the studio releasing the film's first official screen shots of the film to USA Today. Diamond Select Toys created a toy line, scanning the actors from the film with likenesses for the first time in the trilogy. Additional product tie ins came with Harley Davidson and 7 Eleven. A seven minute sneak peek aired on Fox Broadcasting two weeks before the film's theatrical release. Del Rey Books published a novelization of the film, written by comic book writer Chris Claremont, while Newmarket Press published The Art of X Men The Last Stand From Concept to Feature Film. Claremont also worked on Activision's tie in video game, X Men The Official Game, doing the script along with screenwriter Zak Penn. The game's story bridges the events between X2 and The Last Stand, featuring Wolverine, Iceman and Nightcrawler as playable characters, voiced by their film portrayers Hugh Jackman, Shawn Ashmore, and Alan Cumming. Patrick Stewart also appears as Professor X. The game was released to negative reviews and eventually underperformed commercially. X Men The Last Stand premiered at an out of competition event of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival on May 22, 2006. Two days later, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Kelsey Grammer attended an advance screening at USS Kearsarge LHD 3 , as the ship was en route to New York City for Fleet Week. The film was released in the United States on May 26, 2006, in 3,690 theaters, while also opening in 95 international markets that same weekend. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58 based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 5.93 10. The site's critical consensus reads, X Men The Last Stand provides plenty of mutant action for fans of the franchise, even if it does so at the expense of its predecessors' deeper moments. At Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale. Ebert and Roeper gave the film a two thumbs up rating, with Roger Ebert saying, I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was only half a mess , and that Ratner could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did. However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's majesty , praising the performances of Jackman, McKellen, Romijn and Janssen. Famke Janssen's performance was praised by critics. Matt Mueller of Total Film was impressed with Janssen's performance and said, Playing the super freaky mind control goddess like GoldenEye's Xenia Onatopp's all powerful psycho sister, her scenes particularly that one with the house crackle with energy and tragedy. If only the rest of X3 had followed suit. Justin Chang of Variety said the film was a wham bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody atmospherics, and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful. Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said, A risk taking script with genuine consequences elevates this above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner, whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a diminished sequel, a brute force enterprise and said it was an example of what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities . The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner's approach as Forget subtlety Let's blow things up David Edelstein of New York magazine called it just another big budget B movie. It's a fast and enjoyable B movie, though. Foreshadowing X Men First Class, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, Last stand My ass. Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise. And there is just enough to pull a Star Trek and spawn a Next Generation saga. X Men The Last Stand has been criticized by fans for killing off major characters such as Professor Charles Xavier, Cyclops, and Jean Grey. The 2014 film X Men Days of Future Past has subsequently been viewed by some critics as a revision of those controversial plot elements in X Men The Last Stand. Writer Kinberg would later state that there are a lot of things about 'X3' that I love and there are a lot of things that I regret , detailing that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and I would have fought harder for that, considering that at the period the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge 200 million studio movie leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand isn't what I would have done and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in X Men Days of Future Past and the scenes with Leech, which he described as really sweet moments . Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, said that given the limited time they had to make it, the film was pretty good but criticized Ratner's direction I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it. While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's X Men First Class, Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall to wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it. Having admitted being unhappy with the way some elements of the film turned out, Kinberg then went on to direct and write the reboot film Dark Phoenix, which retold the events of X Men The Last Stand. The film broke the Memorial Day weekend record with 102,750,665 in its four day opening weekend. The film's release was also a new single day record for Friday openings. The opening weekend gross was surpassed six weeks later by Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest, making The Last Stand's opening the second highest of 2006. Internationally, The Last Stand topped the box office in 26 countries with a total gross of 76.1 million overall, but suffered competition from The Da Vinci Code, which retained the top spot in most markets, and beat The Last Stand in international gross that weekend with 91 million. The film's second weekend dropped 67 percent to 34 million, which was the steepest post Memorial Day opening drop on record. X Men The Last Stand eventually grossed 234,362,462 in the domestic box office and 224,997,093 internationally, for a worldwide total of 459,359,555, the fourth highest in domestic grosses and seventh highest worldwide for 2006. X Men The Last Stand was also the highest grossing film in the franchise, until it was surpassed by X Men Days of Future Past eight years later.

Extras included three alternative endings, each with optional commentary by director Ratner 10 deleted scenes audio commentaries from Ratner, the writers and the producers and two hidden Easter eggs.

The DVD sold 2.6 million units in its first day, exceeding Fox's expectations, and sold a total 5 million in its first week. A Blu ray edition was issued in November 2006. X Men The Last Stand is included in the X Men Trilogy 4K UHD Blu Ray set which was released on September 25, 2018. In February 2006, Ratner said that The Last Stand could be the final X Men film We wanted to make sure the audiences knew that this was a trilogy. Even though they weren't made together like Lord of the Rings, this is really closure for the X Men series. ... This is the last stand for sure. The next two X Men films, X Men Origins Wolverine 2009 and X Men First Class 2011 were prequels that took place before the events of the first X Men movie. The first film set chronologically after The Last Stand was The Wolverine, released in 2013. A stand alone sequel, The Wolverine shows Logan heading for Japan to escape the memories of what occurred during The Last Stand. Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen reprised their roles, while Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart appear in a mid credits scene. X Men Days of Future Past, the direct sequel to The Last Stand, was released on May 23, 2014, with Jackman, Berry, Stewart, McKellen, Paquin, Page, Ashmore, Cudmore, Grammer, Janssen, and Marsden reprising their respective roles. The plot, inspired by the comic book Days of Future Past story arc, begins with a dystopian future set years after The Last Stand. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back in time, to his 1973 body in order to guide the younger Xavier and Magneto into preventing the events that lead to the desolate future. The events of the film end up retroactively changing the continuity of the series, changing some events in films set after First Class, resulting in an altered timeline where Jean and Cyclops are still alive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%3A%20The%20Last%20Stand

The N Gage version of X Men Legends contains most of the features found on the console versions. However, the game is played from an isometric point of view. Characters are two dimensional sprites based on their three dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. Cutscenes were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower frame rate. Players can link with other N Gage systems for four player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology. X Men Legends is not set in any particular Marvel Comics universe. It is played from the perspective of a teenage girl named Alison Crestmere, a mutant with the ability to control volcanic activity. At the start of the game Alison is abducted by the Genetic Research and Security Organization GRSO . As GRSO soldiers take her away, Mystique arrives with Blob and takes Alison from the soldiers. She is in turn rescued from Mystique and Blob by the X Men Wolverine and Cyclops, who take her to the Xavier Institute to explore her powers. As Alison trains, the X Men investigate an Alaskan research facility controlled by the Brotherhood of Mutants, then rescue Gambit from the Morlocks. They then try to stop the Brotherhood from rescuing Magneto from captivity aboard the U.S.S. Arbiter. Mystique is able to penetrate the defenses and free Magneto, and the ensuing damage caused by the Brotherhood leaves the X Men to rescue several Arbiter crew members. With Alison's training complete, she takes the codename Magma and the X Men travel to Russia to help Colossus prevent the Brotherhood from obtaining weapons grade plutonium. After accomplishing this mission, they discover that Colossus's sister, Illyana, is in a coma from a psychic hold placed on her by the Shadow King. Professor Xavier, Emma Frost, and Jean Grey enter the astral plane to save her. They succeed, but in the process Xavier is captured by the Shadow King. After Xavier's capture the X Men learn that General William Kincaid, a leader in the anti mutant movement, is building mutant hunting Sentinels.

They encounter General Kincaid, who pilots Master Mold, a prototype sentinel larger and more powerful than other sentinels. After defeating General Kincaid, the X Men locate the Gravitron and Magma uses her powers to steer the asteroid back into space. The X Men's victory on Asteroid M is watched by Apocalypse who makes his upcoming plot from his base. In the game's epilogue, a television news anchor reports that Magneto is still at large and General Kincaid has been arrested for crimes against humanity. The game ends with the President of the United States thanking the X Men for their service. a Only playable during sections of the Astral Plane missions. Co project lead Patrick Lipo on the development of the game X Men Legends was announced in a press release by Activision on April 23, 2003. The game is Raven Software's first console title after a number of successful titles for personal computers, it wanted to expand into the console market. The company developed the three console versions simultaneously, and used Vicarious Visions' Alchemy engine as a base for the game. After deciding to make an X Men RPG , staff began brainstorming story, gameplay and design ideas. Raven wanted to feature a team based dynamic, something it felt was absent in previous X Men games. The original concept featured turned based gameplay, similar to a Final Fantasy game. However, the team concluded that players would prefer more action that allowed control of the character's super powers. The genre switch proved problematic to maintaining the team aspect of gameplay. The group experimented with several gameplay models, and opted for one that allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric dungeon crawling video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind each character's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters. For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them. Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions. Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a game over in the event one or more team member was defeated. Raven included flash back missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues. Originally a single player game, Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co orperative gameplay. The developers chose to not create an online multi player mode, stating that the gameplay was designed around localized encounters. The game's story was penned by a group of former Marvel writers known as Man of Action, consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle, with Stan Lee consulting. Man of Action chose the character Magma as their lead because she was an appropriately blank slate as a character. Man of Action also stated that the script for X Men Legends was in excess of five hundred pages. The writers created a story that would allow for players to change their active team throughout the game and not affect the overall flow of the story. The game's voice cast consists largely of television and film stars as well as veteran voice actors. Patrick Stewart reprised his role as Professor Xavier from the X Men films, while Tony Jay voiced Magneto. Ed Asner lent his voice as Healer, a Morlock shaman. Lou Diamond Phillips voiced Forge, a Native American mutant whose power grants him intuitive talent for inventing mechanical devices. Danica McKellar voiced Jubilee, a young mutant who generates plasmoids from her fingertips. Veteran voice actors Steven Blum, Grey DeLisle, Dee Bradley Baker, Robin Atkin Downes and Dorian Harewood also lent voices as Wolverine, Mystique, Nightcrawler, Cyclops and Shadow King, respectively. Music for the game was composed by Rik Schaffer of the Los Angeles based Womb Music. Characters were selected from different time lines in the X Men universe. Art lead Brian Pelletier stated that they took the most memorable characters from the last 40 years and grouped them together. X Men Legends uses cel shading to give the characters a comic like appearance. However, Raven cited that they opted for then high resolution textures to stay away from cartoony looking characters. The process was accomplished by creating a second copy of the model, inverting the normals, then increasing the size of the model slightly. Character costumes were inspired by Marvel Comics' Ultimate X Men. However, some of the X Men playable in X Men Legends had not appeared in the comics at the time of its release so, with permission from Marvel, Raven created unique looks for those characters. During development Raven tried visual formats for the X Men, including using their New X Men uniforms as well as removing the cel shaded look from the characters. In contrast, the back stories, relationships and personalities of the X Men were taken from Marvel's mainstream universe. Angel was also to be included in the game, and was to be voiced by Andre Sogliuzzo, but was cut from the final build. X Men Legends received mostly positive reviews, with the Xbox version receiving the highest aggregate scores of 83.36 at GameRankings and 82 100 at Metacritic. The GameCube version was rated next highest, scoring 81.98 at GameRankings and 81 100 at Metacritic. Though the PlayStation 2 version received the lowest scores of the console versions, it still fared well, scoring 80.50 at GameRankings and 79 100 at Metacritic. The N Gage version garnered scores similar to its console counterparts, receiving 76.13 and 79 100 at GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. In 2011, GamePro retrospectively listed the melee combat, ability to customize your stats, and multiplayer among the strong points of X Men Legends, adding that the game was so successful that it created a well received sequel and paved the way for the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series. Critics generally praised the game's use of cel shading. IGN's Hilary Goldstein stated, To capture the 'comic book feel,' Raven Soft chose to go for a cel shaded look with Legends. It's not that the characters look two dimensional, but they have very basic textures and a cut out look . GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann pointed out that though the characters are cel shaded, the environments are not, making them easy to distinguish. The gameplay was lauded for its role playing elements, character powers and melee combat. Eurogamer praised the Xbox version's control system for character powers and melee attacks, as well as the fluid combat. Reviewers found that the artificial intelligence AI was lacking, and recommended the game's multiplayer. Opinions were generally mixed on the subject of voice acting. X Play reviewer Russ Fischer called it purely average , though he made an exception for Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Professor Xavier. IGN noted that while some voice acting fit the characters well, others seemed out of place. The N Gage version was praised for the ability to play cooperatively using the N Gage's bluetooth technology. Reviewers also found that the game's graphics were very strong and that everything looks amazing . The presence of voice acting in the N Gage port was also praised, with GameSpy reviewer Justin Leeper stating the audio clips seemed to be lifted right out of other versions . He criticized the AI, however, for being bit stupid at inopportune times and for failing to use the game's healing abilities at important moments. X Men Legends sold enough copies to be inducted into the budget lines for all three consoles on which it was released PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits, GameCube's Player's Choice, and Xbox's Platinum Hits. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of X Men Legends had sold 800,000 copies and earned 28 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 74th highest selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the Legends series reached 2 million units in the United States by July 2006. A sequel, X Men Legends II Rise of Apocalypse was released for all major platforms in the fall of 2005, and the N Gage later that year. Barking Lizards again helped port the game, this time to mobile phone devices. Vicarious Visions ported the game to the PlayStation Portable PSP , and Beenox developed the PC port. The success of the X Men Legends series led Raven Software, Marvel, and Activision to create the video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was released on several consoles, handheld devices and the PC in 2007. Barking Lizards, Vicarious Visions and Beenox handled the ports for different platforms. Marvel Ultimate Alliance was followed by Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, jointly developed by Vicarious Visions, n Space and Savage Entertainment. Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 was released on several consoles and handhelds in the fall of 2009. Vicarious Visions developed the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, while n Space developed the Nintendo DS, PSP and Wii versions.

The reviewer from GameTrailers noted that the game's visuals had improved greatly, citing the effects, environments and cinematics as some of the largest upgrades. Inversely GamesRadar's Raymond Padilla felt that the game's graphics felt dated. Steve Steinberg of GameSpy conceded that while the visuals were generally improved over the game's predecessor, it still lacked in quality and variation. Steinberg stated that the characters now felt like a part of the environments, as opposed to cut outs floating on top of it. He noted that even with the improvements that players may lose their character amidst the environment, causing confusion. The success of the X Men Legends series led Raven Software, Marvel, and Activision to create the video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was released on several consoles, handheld devices and Microsoft Windows in 2007. Barking Lizards, Vicarious Visions and Beenox handled the ports for different platforms. Marvel Ultimate Alliance was followed by Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, jointly developed by Vicarious Visions, n Space and Savage Entertainment. Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 was released on several consoles and handhelds in the fall of 2009. Vicarious Visions developed the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, while n Space developed the Nintendo DS, PSP and Wii versions. Savage Entertainment ported the version developed by n Space to the PSP.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%20Legends%20II%3A%20Rise%20of%20Apocalypse
"X Men Origins Wolverine is a 2009 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics fictional character Wolverine. It is the fourth installment of the X Men film series and the first spin off of its standalone Wolverine trilogy. The film was directed by Gavin Hood, written by David Benioff and Skip Woods, and produced by and stars Hugh Jackman. It co stars Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Dominic Monaghan, will.i.am and Ryan Reynolds. The film is a prequel spin off focusing on the violent past of the mutant Wolverine and his relationship with his half brother Victor Creed. The plot details Wolverine's childhood as James Howlett Troye Sivan , his early encounters with Major William Stryker, his time with Team X and the bonding of Wolverine's skeleton with the indestructible metal adamantium during the Weapon X program. The film was mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also serving as a location. Filming took place from January to May 2008. Production and post production were troubled, with delays due to the weather and Jackman's other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director Hood and Fox's executives, and an unfinished workprint being leaked on the Internet one month before the film's debut. X Men Origins Wolverine was released worldwide on May 1, 2009 by 20th Century Fox. While critics praised the cast's acting particularly by Jackman and Schreiber , humor and the musical score, they disliked what they considered to be poorly rendered CGI, a convoluted plot, overabundance of characters, and deviations from the source material, particularly its portrayal of the Deadpool character to the point where several potshots were taken at this portrayal in the character's later films. Despite this, the film opened at the top of the box office and grossed 179 million in the United States and Canada and over 373 million worldwide. A second Wolverine film, The Wolverine, was released in 2013. A third film, Logan, was cited by critics as one of the best superhero films and marked Hugh Jackman's final portrayal of the character. In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Anxiety activates the boy's mutation bone claws protrude from his knuckles and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James' birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas' other son Victor Creed, who is James' half brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James returns to Victor upon the commotion, and ignorant of his brothers intent, he rushes to defend him. This results in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave. Six years later, Logan works as a logger in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan, reporting that Wade and Bradley have been killed someone is targeting the team. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, realizes that Victor is responsible. He finds Victor at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker orders that Logan's memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills the couple the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor. Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor still works for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called The Island . Fred mentions Remy Gambit LeBeau, the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been forced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a mutant killer with the powers of multiple mutants. While Logan and Victor fight off Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to Professor Charles Xavier and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering him unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed, then succumbs to her injuries. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read Logan on one side and Wolverine on the other. He pauses upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her. In a mid credits scene, Stryker is detained for questioning by MPs in connection with the death of General Munson, whom Stryker murdered to protect his experiment. In a post credits scene, following the defeat of Deadpool, his hand crawls out of the rocks and touches his head, which awakens and shushes the screen, revealing that he has survived being decapitated. Additionally, Tim Pocock portrays Scott Summers Cyclops. Max Cullen and Julia Blake portrayed Travis and Heather Hudson, an elderly couple who take care of Wolverine after his adamantium bonding. The Hudsons are heavily adapted from the comics' James MacDonald and Heather Hudson. Tahyna Tozzi portrays Emma, a mutant with the power to turn her skin into diamond, who in the film is Silverfox's sister. The film depiction of Emma was originally intended to be Emma Frost. However it was noted that she does not exhibit the character's traditional telepathic abilities. It is later revealed by Bryan Singer that this character is actually not Emma Frost, but instead a mutant with similar abilities. Wolverine's parents also appeared in the film Aaron Jeffery portrayed Thomas Logan while Alice Parkinson portrayed Elizabeth Howlett. Peter O'Brien appeared as John Howlett, James' alleged father. The film includes numerous cameo appearances of younger versions of characters from the previous films, including Jason Stryker William's lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps in cryogenic suspension . There was a cameo for a young Storm, which can be seen in the trailer, but it was removed from the released film. A digitally rejuvenated Patrick Stewart also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier who appeared to not yet lose the use of his legs. However, with timeline and story inconsistencies within the film series, Singer developed an idea to tie all the films together and fix the continuity. In X Men First Class, Xavier loses the use of his legs at a much younger age than he appears in Origins. As an explanation, Xavier can be seen walking in X Men Days of Future Past which chronologically takes place prior to the events of this film , by creating the illusion that he is standing in various scenes, when in reality the character is only present by telepathic projection. Asher Keddie played Dr. Carol Frost. Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo. Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto. X Men co creator Stan Lee said he would cameo, but Lee ended up not appearing in the film as he could not attend filming in Australia. David Benioff, a comic book fan, pursued the project for almost three years before he was hired to write the script in October 2004. In preparing to write the script, he reread Barry Windsor Smith's Weapon X story, as well as Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character his favorite storyline . Also serving as inspiration was the 2001 limited series Origin, which reveals Wolverine's life before Weapon X. Jackman collaborated on the script, which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous X Men films. Skip Woods, who had written Hitman for Fox, was later hired to revise and rewrite Benioff's script. Benioff had aimed for a darker and a bit more brutal story, writing it with an R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the film's final tone would rest with the producers and director. Deadpool had been developed for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on Blade Trinity and an aborted spin off. Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun, but would also deviate from some of his traits. Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried to put in the previous X Men films. Jackman liked Gambit because he is a loose cannon like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy. David Ayer contributed to the script. Benioff finished his draft in October 2006 and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting, as he was scheduled to start filming Australia during 2007. Before the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last minute rewrite. Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release. Previously, X Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X Men The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise, while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job. Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen. Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hood's previous film Tsotsi. Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he realized that the character of Wolverine, I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature . The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities. Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin off a different feel. Hood also suggested to make the implied blood relation of Wolverine and Sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers, as it would help build up the emotional power of the film . In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009, release date and the X Men Origins prefix. Preliminary shooting took place at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, during late 2007. Principal photography began on January 2008 in New Zealand. One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin. Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour's decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink. Fox moved some of the explosives to another area. The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm, a scene which required thirteen cameras. Jackman and Palermo's Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly. According to Hood, the screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun, with the production in Australia receiving regularly new script pages from Los Angeles, at times in the night before shooting. Filming continued at Fox where most of the shooting was done and New Orleans, Louisiana. Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker's facility the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set. Production of the film was predicted to generate A 60 million for Sydney's economy. Principal photography ended by May 23. The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23 and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap. This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales. Hood and Fox were in dispute on the film's direction. One of the disputes involved the depiction of Wolverine as an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder, with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes. The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on set tensions. Hood remarked, Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better. ... I hope the film's better because of the debates. If nobody were talking about us, we'd be in trouble Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both forceful personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a stand up argument. In January 2009, after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts, such as Hugh Jackman's publicity commitments for Australia, production moved to Vancouver, mostly at Kitsilano Secondary School and in University of British Columbia. Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography. Gavin Hood announced that multiple secret endings exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film. One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asks if he is drinking to forget, to which Logan replies that he is drinking to remember. The other ending shows Weapon XI on the rubble of the destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head. More than 1,000 shots of Wolverine have visual effects in them, which required three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies to work on the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the filma pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Islandand Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes. Composed by Harry Gregson Williams, the score for X Men Origins Wolverine was mixed by Malcolm Luker, engineered by Costa Kotselas, and featured Martin Tillman on the electric cello. In a 2008 interview with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson Williams said that Hood attracted him to the project, adding I happened to meet him at the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine. In late March 2009, Jon Burlingame of Variety was at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th century Fox to listen and report on the recording of the score. Gregson Williams conducted a 78 piece orchestra and a 40 voice choir 20 male, 20 female to achieve the sound. At the time of his visit, Burlingame noted that the choir was singing stanzas from an ancient Norse poem in Old Icelandic to underscore what would be first track, Logan Through Time. Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson Williams' style, saying Harry's challenge is to give us operatic scale, but also keep it intimate and human. Harry's music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for the action, but he also has tremendous soul. Hood also called the recording performance frigging brilliant On March 31, 2009, a full length DVD quality workprint of the film without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online. The studio said it would be able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint. The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting. Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4.5 million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters. As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it. The print contained a reference to Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian visual effects company working on the film. The company denied that they ever had a full copy of the film. Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick ups in January 2009. However, the theatrical version of the film has no extra scenes that were not included in the leaked workprint. Both versions run exactly 107 minutes, but director Gavin Hood said another ending exists that features the film's villain. The leak was traced down to a Bronx man named Gilberto Sanchez, who had bought an unlicensed DVD copy from a Korean man and later uploaded it under the name SkillyGilly . Roger Friedman, a gossip reporter for Fox Newsa channel also owned by Fox's parent company News Corporationwas fired for writing a review of the film using the leaked copy he downloaded from the Internet. He described how easy it was to find and download the film even if the original source of the leak was no longer available on the web. The article he wrote for his column on the Fox News website was immediately removed. Among the companies which provided tie in merchandising were 7 Eleven, Papa John's Pizza, and Schick. Hugh Jackman also posed as Wolverine for the Got Milk campaign. In February 2009, Hasbro released a film related toyline, featuring action figures and a glove with retractable claws. In April, Marvel debuted a new comic series, Wolverine Weapon X, which writer Jason Aaron said that while not directly influenced by the film, was written considering people who would get interested in Wolverine comics after watching the film. In December 2009, Hot Toys released the 12 inch highly detailed figure of Wolverine based on the movie with Hugh Jackman's likeness. Raven Software developed a video game based on the film with the same name, which Activision published. Marc Guggenheim wrote the script, while Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and will.i.am voiced their characters from the film. The storyline goes beyond the one from the film, including other villains from the comics such as the Sentinels and the Wendigo, as well as the appearance of Mystique, who was in the other three X Men films. X Men Origins Wolverine was released on April 29, 2009, in the UK, Denmark, South Africa, and Australia April 30, 2009 in the Philippines and in the Dominican Republic and May 1, 2009 in the United States and Canada. A contest was held on the official website to determine the location of the world premiere on April 27. In the end, the Harkins at the Tempe Marketplace in Tempe, Arizona won the premiere. The release in Mexico was delayed until the end of May due to an outbreak of H1N1 flu in the country. On April 22, nine days before the release of the film, it was reported that X Men Origins Wolverine was outselling Iron Man 3 to 1 at the same point in the sales cycle nine days prior to the film's release . During its first day of wide release, Wolverine took in an estimated 35 million, with almost 5 million of that from midnight showings. The earnings placed the film as the 16th highest grossing opening day ever 22nd with ticket price inflation . It went on to be number one film at the box office with a total of 85 million. Among summer kick offs, it ranked fifth behind Spider Man, X2, Spider Man 3, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations. The opening was lower than the last film in the franchise, X Men The Last Stand, as well as X2, but higher than X Men, the first film in the series. The worldwide opening was over 158.1 million, but Fox stated that some markets underperformed, mostly due to the leaked workprint in countries with illegal downloading problems. However, in an article for the piracy issue of Screen International magazine, film critic John Hazelton was doubtful of this explanation, writing that the film's initial performance was uncertain as the outbreak of swine flu in territories with the worst copyright infringement problems means that other territories did not compare at all. While it has received mixed reviews from critics, the film has been a financial success at the box office. According to Box Office Mojo Wolverine has grossed approximately 179,883,157 in the United States and Canada. It took in another 193,179,707 in other territories, giving it a worldwide total of 373,062,864. On September 15, 2009, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released X Men Origins Wolverine on DVD and Blu ray disc. The two disc Blu ray includes commentary by Hood, another commentary by producers Lauren Shuler Donner and Ralph Winter, the featurette The Roots of Wolverine A Conversation with X Men creators Stan Lee and Len Wein , the featurette Wolverine Unleashed The Complete Origins , 10 character chronicles, two more featurettes, a trivia track, deleted scenes with commentary from Hood, two alternate sequences, a Fox Movie Channel premiere featurette and imdb BD Live technology. Disc two of the set includes a digital copy. In addition, a Wal Mart exclusive 3 disc set, which includes a standard DVD copy of the film was also released. The two DVD special edition includes the two commentaries, the featurette with Stan Lee and Len Wein, an origins featurette, deleted and alternate scenes, and an anti smoking PSA on disc one disc two has a digital copy of the film. The single disc DVD release has the origins featurette and anti smoking PSA. Wolverine was the highest selling and most rented DVD release of the week, selling over three million copies, 850,000 of them on Blu ray. Through its first six weeks the DVD has sold 3.79 million copies, generating 64.27 million in sales. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37 based on 258 reviews, with an average rating of 5.13 10. The site's critical consensus reads, Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X Men Origins Wolverine overcome a cliche ridden script and familiar narrative. On Metacritic the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale. Richard Corliss of TIME commented on the film's standing among other Marvel films, saying that it is an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy. He also said that superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic book reading kid could make sense of it all. James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James , AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins, stating Fortunately, Jackman is well matched with Schreiber, who can sneer with the best of them and wears fangs well. The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor. Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman's performance, saying that Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song and dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage. Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie well acted, with spectacular action and witty one liners . Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and asked about the title character, Why should I care about this guy He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so therefore he's essentially a story device for action sequences. James Berardinelli gave Wolverine two and a half stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in , and that the revelations made Wolverine less compelling . Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive 4.0 out of 5 stars, saying that although Hugh Jackman is capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X Men Origins Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season. He predicted there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology and further said that any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal. Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X Men franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X tinction. Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that X Men Origins Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue. On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's dull, bone crushing, special effects stuff is of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics. Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph stated that Wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of the most unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first after that though, when word of mouth buzz kill goes into overdrive, there's bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned. Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN UK praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying. Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of D , noting that Wolverine was the lead character of the X Men films, and we've already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise, adding that the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan Wolverine less interesting. Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them , while also being a mash up of meaningless combat sequences meaningless because Logan Wolverine is just about unstoppable , sub par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber as a villain thespianizing . Hugh Jackman later confessed being unhappy with the final result of X Men Origins Wolverine. The actor wanted primarily a film that would deepen the Wolverine character, but somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X Men just with different characters. He tried to avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine. Two cases exist of adolescents injecting themselves with elemental mercury after having seen X Men Origins Wolverine and incorrectly believing this would convert their bones to metal similar to Wolverine. Wolverine was set to be the first of a series of X Men Origins prequels, with the other being focused on Magneto. However, X Men Origins Magneto entered development hell and was eventually canceled. X Men First Class, released in 2011, was another prequel to the series. Set in 1962, the film features a young Professor X and Magneto and the foundation of the X Men. In 2013, a second Wolverine film was released titled The Wolverine, set years after the events of X Men The Last Stand, but mostly serving as a stand alone sequel. The follow up to First Class, 2014's X Men Days of Future Past, was confirmed to erase the events of X Men Origins Wolverine through retroactive continuity. A third Wolverine film titled Logan was released on March 3, 2017. It is Hugh Jackman's last time portraying the character. The 2016 spin off film Deadpool and its 2018 sequel Deadpool 2 feature Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as the title character. Several jokes are aimed at the expense of the version of Deadpool in X Men Origins Wolverine due to the negative reaction of the character's portrayal. A Deadpool 2 mid credits scene depicts that film's version of Wilson traveling backwards in time to the events of X Men Origins Wolverine to kill the widely criticized Weapon XI interpretation of Deadpool.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%20Origins%3A%20Wolverine
"X Men vs. Street Fighter is a crossover fighting video game developed and published by Capcom. It is Capcom's third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters, following X Men Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, and the first installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. As the title suggests, the game includes characters from Marvel's X Men franchise and the cast from Capcom's Street Fighter series. Originally released as a coin operated arcade game in 1996, it was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and the PlayStation in 1998. X Men vs. Street Fighter features gameplay similar to Street Fighter, but incorporates dual character selection and tag team based combat. Each player selects two characters to compete in a one on one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X Men Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes. The game was released to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise for maintaining the experience of the original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles. The changes were done in response to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. A sequel to the game, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, was released in 1997. Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game in which players control various characters to engage in one on one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best of three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters at the beginning of a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off screen. The starting character can tag in the off screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner. The game borrows numerous gameplay conventions from Capcom's previous Marvel licensed ventures, X Men Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, such as the Super Jump , the ability to jump higher than normal, and Aerial Rave , the ability to perform combos on the opponent while in the air. X Men vs. Street Fighter also includes a meter system similar to the two aforementioned games called the Hyper Combo Gauge . As characters perform moves and receive damage, the players' Hyper Combo Gauges will gradually fill. Players can expend their meter to perform various special techniques, such as the Hyper Combo , which unleashes high amounts of damage Variable Combination , where both characters use their Hyper Combos simultaneously and Variable Counter , which transforms a defensive block into an offensive counterattack by tagging in the off screen character. The arcade, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation versions of X Men vs. Street Fighter all include Arcade Mode and Versus Mode. In Arcade Mode, the player fights several artificial intelligence controlled teams before competing in a final battle against the boss character, Apocalypse, an antagonist from the X Men series. In Versus Mode, two players can fight against each other locally. The PlayStation port also features Training Mode, where players can practice moves and combos against non aggressive computer opponents, and Survival Mode, where players fight against endless waves of teams. X Men vs. Street Fighter features a roster of 17 playable characters. The character sprites for the X Men characters were drawn from X Men Children of the Atom, with the exception of Rogue, Gambit, and Sabretooth, who had not appeared in a previous Capcom fighting game. The sprite designs themselves are based on the characters' appearances from the 1990s animated X Men television series, complete with the original voice actors. The Street Fighter character sprites are reused from Street Fighter Alpha 2. Similar to his secret guest appearance in Children of the Atom, Akuma appears as a hidden character in X Men vs. Street Fighter. In order to create a level playing field between the cast of Street Fighter and the X Men series' superheroes and supervillains, the Street Fighter characters were re imagined with highly exaggerated versions of their special moves. For example, Ryu comes equipped with a super Hadouken that fills the entire screen. X Men vs. Street Fighter debuted in Japan in September 1996 for the CP System II arcade board, and was released worldwide later on in 1996. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn in Japan on November 27, 1997. The port utilized the Saturn's 4MB RAM cartridge peripheral, which was packaged alongside the game, to deliver an arcade perfect conversion. It was not officially released in North America due to the Saturn's low sales numbers in the North American market. An imported version was sold at certain Electronics Boutique locations. Sega had initially intended to release the game in Europe bundled with the expansion cartridge however, these plans were eventually shelved. At a November 6, 1996 press conference, Capcom announced that the home version of X Men vs. Street Fighter would be exclusive to the Saturn. Facing ongoing accusations of favoritism towards the Saturn due to the perceived superiority of the Saturn version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 over the PlayStation version, and the home version of Night Warriors Darkstalkers' Revenge being Saturn exclusive , Capcom later rescinded this announcement, stating instead that PlayStation and Saturn versions of X Men vs. Street Fighter would be released simultaneously and would both be arcade perfect. However, the PlayStation version was not released until February 26, 1998 in Japan, where it was renamed X Men vs. Street Fighter EX Edition. The PlayStation port was also released in North America on June 11, 1998, and Europe in November 1998. Moreover, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation, both the graphics and gameplay of the port were altered. Several frames of character sprite animations were removed to reduce the amount of RAM usage. Most notably, the tag team combat was omitted. Instead of being able to switch between characters at will, the second character only comes into play during certain attacks, such as Variable Combinations and Variable Counters. In addition, the one round battles used in the arcade and Sega Saturn versions were extended to a two out of three round setup. The PlayStation version includes a code that allows players to compete in pseudo tag team matches , provided that each player uses their opponent's starting character as their partner. For example, if Player 1 is controlling Ryu and Player 2 is controlling Wolverine, then Player 1's partner will be Wolverine and Player 2's partner will be Ryu. A reviewer for Next Generation scored the arcade version three out of five stars. He complimented the tag team mechanic and noted that the game continued the inflation of explosive projectiles and lengthy combos from Capcom's previous 2D fighters, but felt this breed of game had been milked out, concluding, X Men Vs. Street Fighter is a fun game, but it's just a bit of an overdose of the kind of game of which we've already played way too much. X Men vs. Street Fighter was only mildly popular when first released in North American arcades, but after several months it caught on and became a hit. The Sega Saturn edition of X Men vs. Street Fighter received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Reviewers praised its fast paced gameplay, animation and sound quality, and technical performance in comparison to the original arcade version. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot commended the character sprite animations and background details, claiming that there is no better looking 2D fighter on any console system . While Gerstmann also praised the port for its fast loading times and lack of slowdown, he criticized the game for its defense oriented gameplay and unoriginal soundtrack. Game Informer lauded the port for running and looking identical to its arcade counterpart, declaring it one of the best arcade conversions ever seen to date . The PlayStation version, on the other hand, received mixed reviews according to GameRankings. Many reviewers' critiques were centered on the port's various changes as a result of the PlayStation's technical restraints. Both GameSpot and Game Revolution lambasted the game for its removal of tag team battles and several instances of slowdown. The two sites also criticized the port's low frame rate and noticeable decline in animation quality. While Game Informer and IGN shared many of the same criticisms, they viewed the game from a more positive perspective. Both maintained that, while the PlayStation port paled in comparison to the Sega Saturn version, it was still a solid fighting game. As for the arcade version, AllGame gave it a score of four stars out of five. Next Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that If nothing else, X Men vs. Street Fighter proves the old adage, 'more is better.' Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that If you've never seen a Capcom fighting game before, this might be fun for a few minutes, but there is not one single positive thing to be said for the trade offs that Capcom made to get this game to PlayStation. Ouch. A sequel to X Men vs. Street Fighter was released by Capcom in 1997. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, while similar in terms of gameplay and art style, replaces a majority of the X Men cast with characters from other Marvel Comics properties, such as Captain America and Spider Man. The game is notable for introducing assists into the Marvel vs. Capcom series, which allow players to summon their off screen character to perform an attack during battle. Like X Men vs. Street Fighter, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation, which were released in 1998 and 1999, respectively.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%20vs.%20Street%20Fighter
"X Men Days of Future Past is a 2014 superhero film directed and produced by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg from a story by Kinberg, Jane Goldman, and Matthew Vaughn. A British American venture, the film is based on the fictional X Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics and is the seventh installment of the X Men film series, the sequel to both X Men The Last Stand 2006 and X Men First Class 2011 , and a follow up to The Wolverine 2013 . The story, inspired by the 1981 Uncanny X Men storyline Days of Future Past by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, focuses on two time periods, with Wolverine traveling back in time to 1973 to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. The film features an ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Nicholas Hoult, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. Vaughn had directed X Men First Class and was set to return in Days of Future Past before leaving for Kingsman The Secret Service and the 2015 version of Fantastic Four. Thus Singer, who had directed the first two X Men films, made his return as a director, and brought along most of the crew from those productions. With a budget of 205 million principal photography began in Montreal, Quebec in April 2013 and concluded in August the same year, with additional filming and pick ups taking place in November 2013 and February 2014. Twelve companies handled the visual effects. X Men Days of Future Past premiered in New York City on May 10, 2014, and was theatrically released on May 23 by 20th Century Fox. It is the second best reviewed film in the X Men film series following Logan, drawing favorable notices for its story, visual effects, action scenes, acting, thematic elements, and Singer's direction. During its theatrical run, the film earned over 747 million worldwide, making it the sixth highest grossing film of 2014, as well as the second highest grossing film in the series behind Deadpool. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects, making it the first X Men film to be nominated for an Oscar. A sequel, titled X Men Apocalypse, was released on May 27, 2016. In the year 2023 in a dystopian future, Sentinels have been programmed to identify and hunt down mutants and any humans who dared to help them. A small band of X Men survivors consisting of Kitty Pryde, Iceman, Colossus, Bishop, Blink, Warpath, and Sunspot are hiding out in Moscow, but are soon attacked by Sentinels and slaughtered. During the battle, Kitty Pryde sends Bishop's consciousness back in time a few days before the attack to warn the others in order to ensure their survival. The group later meets with Professor Charles Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, and Storm at a remote Chinese temple. Xavier explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by Bolivar Trask, a military scientist who was assassinated by Mystique in 1973. Alarmed by Trask's death, government forces had captured Mystique and used her DNA to advance Trask's unfinished Sentinel program by giving them the ability to adapt to nearly every mutant power it was this upgrade that made the Sentinels invincible and resulted in the apocalyptic future. Xavier and Magneto plan to use Pryde's ability to send Xavier's consciousness back to 1973 in order to prevent Trask's assassination and the apocalyptic future, but because Xavier would not survive going back decades, Wolverine volunteers to go in his place because his regenerative powers would allow him to survive the process. After awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine arrives at the X Mansion, which he discovers has been closed for years due to many of its staff and students being drafted into the Vietnam War. He also learns that Erik Lensherr was arrested for killing John F. Kennedy and that the young and despairing Xavier had turned to alcoholism, shunning his mutant powers with a specialized serum that suppresses his telepathic abilities in exchange for the ability to walk. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine and breaks Lensherr out of his prison cell under the Pentagon, aided by Hank McCoy and the newly recruited Peter Maximoff. Lensherr is angry at Xavier for suppressing his powers and not being there to protect fellow mutants who were sent to Vietnam. Mystique discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and in revenge, plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords. Her attempt fails after Xavier, McCoy, and Wolverine intervene. However, Lensherr attempts to kill her, believing this could prevent the Sentinel takeover from happening. A fight ensues between McCoy and Lensherr, which allows Mystique to escape, but the three expose themselves as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President Richard Nixon to initialize the Sentinel program. Erik obtains his signature helmet back from the Pentagon to block Xavier's psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes. Returning to the X Mansion, Xavier ultimately abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and baseline humans. After using Cerebro to track Mystique, the young Xavier, McCoy, and Wolverine take flight to Washington, D.C. to put an end to her plot to assassinate Trask. At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Xavier, McCoy, and Wolverine search for the disguised Mystique. Magneto arrives and uses the Sentinels to barricade the White House with the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. During the battle, Magneto impales Wolverine with multiple construction rods and throws him into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Mystique retreat to the White House Bunker, but Magneto rips it out of the building, intending to kill the President. In the future, the Sentinels manage to find the X Men and launch an attack on them. Many perish while attempting to buy more time, including Colossus, Blink, Storm, Bishop, Iceman, Warpath and Sunspot, while Magneto and Kitty are heavily injured. In 1973, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves Nixon from Magneto, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Magneto and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero while Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S. military secrets to Vietnamese officials. Wolverine wakes up at the X Mansion in 2023 to find Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, Kitty Pryde, Beast, Storm, Jean Grey, Scott Summers, and Xavier all alive. Wolverine speaks to Xavier, who states that they have a lot to talk about after Wolverine asks Xavier to catch him up on what he has missed. Back in 1973, the younger Wolverine is pulled out of the Potomac River by Mystique, who is disguised as William Stryker. In a post credits scene, set in Ancient Egypt, an Egyptian crowd is seen chanting to En Sabah Nur, who telekinetically elevates building blocks to build pyramids as four horsemen observe him from afar. Additionally, Famke Janssen and James Marsden reprise their roles as Jean Grey and Scott Summers Cyclops respectively in cameo appearances. Lucas Till reprises his role as Alex Summers Havok. Evan Jonigkeit portrays Toad. Gregg Lowe portrays Ink. X Men comic book writers Len Wein and Chris Claremont appear as United States congressmen. Michael Lerner plays Senator Brickman. Mark Camacho portrays U.S. President Richard Nixon. Singer cameos as a man with a small film camera as Magneto walks away after Mystique's escape in Paris. In a post credits scene, Brendan Pedder portrays the ancient mutant, En Sabah Nur. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner stated in August 2006 that a continuation of the X Men main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of X Men The Last Stand were signed, while the older cast members were not. Donner said, There is forty years worth of stories. I've always wanted to do 'Days of Future Past' and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told . She later pitched the idea of a fourth installment of the X Men franchise to director Bryan Singer, following the completion of the 2011 prequel X Men First Class. In March 2011, Donner said the film was in active development at Fox she said, We took the treatment to Fox and they love it ... And X4 leads into X5 . 20th Century Fox saw X Men First Class as the first film of a new X Men trilogy. Donner compared the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, First Class is similar to Batman Begins, where you have the fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight . Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, I thought it would be fun to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto . Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about changing history in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past erasing the storylines of the previous X Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes. Kinberg said the main focus of this film was the future of the X Men film series. With the use of cast members from the original trilogy and from First Class, they needed to decide the sequels' destination. In preparation for the film, Kinberg studied films about time travel, including Back to the Future, The Terminator, and Terminator 2 Judgment Day. Singer originated a philosophy and a set of rules for the time travel in the film so the story would be as plausible as possible. According to Kinberg, as they were writing the script, they thought it is sensible that Wolverine was traveling between time periods, because of his ageless look and ability to heal rapidly. He further stated of making Wolverine the time traveler, We made the decision for a lot of reasons ... he's the protagonist of the franchise, and probably the most beloved character to a mass audience . Kinberg and Vaughn considered Bishop and Cable candidates for the role of time traveler. Kinberg said Rachel Summers was in the first draft of the script she sent Wolverine back to 1972. The character was later replaced with Kitty Pryde, to whom Kinberg gave a secondary power of sending people's consciousnesses into the past. Juggernaut, Jubilee, Nightcrawler and Psylocke were also considered for the film. Singer was asked how the film integrates the themes of the earlier X Men films he said, It establishes that some villain characters may have been right with their fears. It confronts the notions of hope and second chances. Its characters that are lost trying to find themselves. In X Men 1 and 2, the characters had come into their own and knew who they were. In this one, they're all lost and they're trying to keep it together . In November 2011, Simon Kinbergco writer of X Men The Last Stand and co producer of X Men First Classwas hired to write the film's screenplay. In May 2012, 20th Century Fox announced the film would be released on July 18, 2014. The release was later moved forward to May 23, 2014. In August 2012, the title for the film was confirmed to be X Men Days of Future Past. The film is inspired by Chris Claremont and John Byrne's X Men comic book storyline, Days of Future Past , which introduced the idea of an alternate future for mutants that grew from the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants' killing of a senator, leading to a future in which mutants are hunted by Sentinels. In October 2012, Vaughn left the role of director to focus on Mark Millar's Kingsman The Secret Service 2014 . Singer was later announced as the film's director it was his third directorial role in the X Men film series. In preparation for the film, Singer approached James Cameron to discuss time travel, string theory and multiverses. In the same month, Richard Stammers was approached to be the visual effects supervisor, as Singer liked his work in the 2012 film Prometheus. Singer brought back most of the crew he had in X Men and X2. In December 2012, two long absent designers were hired production designer John Myhre, who had only done X Men, and costume designer Louise Mingenbach who also did X2 and X Men Origins Wolverine. In February 2013, John Ottmanwho aside from X Men, collaborated on all of Singer's works since the 1995 film The Usual Suspectswas confirmed to work on the music and the editing of the film. Bryan Singer, explaining the Twitter presence of the film Singer used the online social networking service Twitter to announce casting of the film. In November 2012, he announced that James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult would reprise their roles from X Men First Class. Later the same month, he announced that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen would reprise their respective roles as the older versions of the characters played by McAvoy and Fassbender. In December, Singer announced that Hugh Jackman would reprise his role as Wolverine. In January 2013, Singer announced that Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore, and Ellen Page would reprise their roles of Rogue, Iceman, and Kitty Pryde. In February, Singer announced that Peter Dinklage would star in the film as the main antagonist. In March, Singer announced that French actor Omar Sy had joined the cast. Halle Berry said in an interview that she would reprise her role as Storm, which was followed by an announcement from Singer that Berry would be in the film. Singer tweeted a picture of the cast, which confirmed that Daniel Cudmore would return as Colossus and that Fan Bingbing and Booboo Stewart had joined the cast. In April, Singer announced that American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga had joined the cast as Dazzler, but it was later revealed as an April Fools' Day prank. Singer retweeted a photograph of himself, Adan Canto, and confirmed cast members Patrick Stewart, McKellen, and Ashmore, which was followed by a confirmation from Canto that he had joined the cast. In May, Singer announced that Evan Peters had been cast as Quicksilver. In June, Australian actor Josh Helman was cast in a role. In July, Singer tweeted a picture of actor Lucas Till on the set of the film, which confirmed that he was returning as Havok. In January 2014, Evan Jonigkeit had been cast as the younger version of Toad. X Men Days of Future Past had a production budget of 205 million. Principal photography began on April 15, 2013, at Mel's Cite du Cinema in Montreal, Canada, and ended on August 17, 2013. Filming had to begin in April 2013 to accommodate the cast's individual schedules. Olympic Stadium, Montreal City Hall, and McGill University were also used as filming locations. An aerial plate unit was sent to film in Washington, D.C. Additional filming took place in Montreal in November 2013 and February 2014. According to the Calgary Herald, the film is the second most expensive produced by 20th Century Fox after Avatar 2009 . Comic book writer Chris Claremont said in an interview that he was consulted for the film. X Men Days of Future Past is the first X Men film to be filmed in native 3D it was shot using Arri Alexa M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with 3ality Technica TS 35 camera rigs and Stereo Image Processor SIP technology systems. Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa M cameras he said, For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film . Sigel added that the Arri Alexa M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work. Production designer John Myhre said his work load was six months squeeze down in to 3 4 months , given the sets were massive but he did not have the usual time to design and build before principal photography began. The lue underground hallways and Cerebro sets were faithful recreations of the sets seen in the first X Men, albeit ransacked and damaged to imply the government had raided the mansion. The sets had many hidden Xs , including the staircase of the X Mansion. Myrhe said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way First Class embraced its 1960s setting, and costume designer Louise Mingenbach also drew heavily from 1970s styles for the clothing seen in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden paneled buckle and a peacock print shirt, and McAvoy wore a brown leather jacket. Peters wore 1981 inspired clothing this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X Men film. For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. This included changing the suit Patrick Stewart had previously worn as Xavier to battle fatigues. The Sentinels had two separate versions, to depict how the earlier prototypes built by Trask in the 1970s evolved into the adaptable killing machines of the dystopian future. Singer described the 1973 version as a little fun and stylish but also a little retro , with a key element being that they are made of plastic to be unaffected by Magneto's powers. Myhre used styles from molded plastics from the 1970s to design Sentinels from that period, and cited inspiration from both the cars of the decade and those wonderful TV sets that were round with smoked glass panels . The overall style was bulky to fit the traditional idea of a robot looks like , and drew the most from the comics version, such as the purple color and a humanoid shape, while trying to stand out on its own with its retro design. The robots' ability to fly was compared to a Harrier Jump Jet, as the Sentinels had vertical takeoff and could glide. Life sized Sentinels were built by Legacy Effects to be featured on the set, and had articulated joints to be fully poseable. The sound effects averted metallic noises, while adding woof effects on the Sentinels' footsteps to display its weight on the ground. On the other hand, the future Sentinels would resemble giant versions of Mystique to show how their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move during the process of adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind , which the director imagined to be fueled by nanotechnology and the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level . The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. The crackling sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on shale rocks. For the future setting of the film, a set featuring a hillside monastery was built. Myhre was inspired by Chinese temples built on the sides of cliffs. The future set also featured a mixture of architectural styles from China, India, and Indonesia. Part of the set was a big wall, which was inspired by the Great Wall of China. X Men Days of Future Past had 1,311 visual effects shots produced by twelve studios. Richard Stammer served as the overall effects supervisor based on his work for Prometheus. The leading company was Moving Picture Company, who created the future Sentinels and worked on the sequences involving the X Jet and Cerebro's red virtual world. The Sentinels' scaled bodies were created by adapting a tool originally developed to create hair and fur, which would later evolve into creating a proxy representation of each individual scale as a follicle . Another major contributor was Digital Domain, with effects from the 1973 portion that encompassed nearly a third of the work. These included the Sentinels, Mystique's transformations and eyes, and various digital environments. Digital augmentation turned a remote airstrip into a Vietnam prisoner camp and added Paris' famed mansard rooftops to the Montreal locations. The environment work based on Washington, D.C. required the team to study period references of the National Mall and White House, and photograph almost all of RFK Stadium to create a detailed digital replica. Rising Sun Pictures created a sequence considered by many reviewers the centerpiece of the film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in slow motion. After doing LIDAR scan of the kitchen set, the digital recreation added many computer generated props cooking gear, cutlery, vegetables and water released by a fire sprinkler system rendered in near microscopic detail regarding placement and lighting, particularly because the footage had to work in 3D. To simulate Quicksilver running on the walls, Evan Peters and a stunt double were filmed in both the set being suspended by a harness and on a treadmill that stood in front of a chroma key green screen. Only Peters' legs were digitally replaced. Despite the sequence only having 29 effects shots, it required nearly seven months of work from RSP's team of 70 artists. Rhythm and Hues Studios worked on Beast's transformations, the creation of Xavier's plane, and speed effects for Quicksilver. They also worked with Digital Domain on the sequence featuring the inside of the 1973 Sentinel. Mokko Studio worked on Mystique's eyes and costume fixes. Cinesite worked on the future New York City in the opening prologue along with clean ups, wire removals, and production fixes. Fuel VFX worked on holographic effects and Havok's mutant powers. Vision Globale worked on visual effects relating to a dream and flashback sequence. Hydraulx, Lola and Method Studios handled a number of compositions and production fixes. The Third Floor worked on extensive story boarding and visualisation. Director Bryan Singer's regular collaborator John Ottman worked on the score of the film, in addition to being its editor. Ottman is the first composer to score more than one film in the X Men film series, having previously scored X2 2003 . This also marked the first time a theme from a previous X Men film has been retained Ottman re used some of his themes from X2, most notably the main title theme. While Ottman retained the same style of lyrical and build upon character themes that would weave in and out of the film and done in a straight orchestral sense that he had used in X2, following Singer's request he tried to compose something more 'modern' that could be compared to other contemporary superhero scores, and not follow Henry Jackman' score for First Class. The 1970s setting inspired the inclusion of synthesized elements with some analog synths and electric piano and bass and some guitar . The film score was released on digital download on May 16, 2014, on CD on May 26, 2014, and on vinyl on August 4, 2014. An expanded version of the soundtrack, including music exclusive to The Rogue Cut, was released on June 24, 2015 by Sony Classical Records. The world premiere of X Men Days of Future Past occurred at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City on May 10, 2014. It was released in international markets in 2D and 3D theaters on May 21, 2014, and in the United States on May 23, 2014. Premiere events were also held in London, Beijing, Moscow, Singapore, Sao Paulo, Melbourne, and Tokyo. In June 2013, 20th Century Fox presented a set tour video of X Men Days of Future Past at the CineEurope conference in Barcelona director Bryan Singer acted as the tour guide. The set tour video was included with the home video release of the 2013 film The Wolverine. In July 2013, Singer, writer Simon Kinberg, producers Lauren Shuler Donner and Hutch Parker, together with cast members Jennifer Lawrence, Evan Peters, Omar Sy, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, and Peter Dinklage presented at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con International. Footage from the film was screened. In August 2013, Singer presented footage from the film at the Fantasia International Film Festival. In March 2014, 20th Century Fox presented footage from the film at CinemaCon. In April 2014, Page presented footage from the film at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. Kinberg and Dinklage attended WonderCon to discuss the film. Singer withdrew from the publicity rounds for the film because of a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse filed against him. In July 2014, 20th Century Fox and Oculus Rift presented a virtual reality experience in 2014 San Diego Comic Con International. Attendees were given a chance to sit in a replica of Professor X's wheelchair and virtually hunt Mystique in the San Diego Convention Center. In July 2013, a mid credits scene teasing X Men Days of Future Past was attached to the theatrical release of The Wolverine. The scene, set two years after the events of The Wolverine, depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto why he should trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of Yahoo Movies described the mid credits scene as the coolest part of The Wolverine and wrote, Boom And that's how you tease the next film by giving us so much to chew on, yet so few answers . The first official trailer for X Men Days of Future Past was released in October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh ... we still have to wait till the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest . Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the number of characters that would appear in the film. Child wrote, overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map . A mid credits scene teasing X Men Days of Future Past was attached to the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider Man 2 in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. The Amazing Spider Man 2 director Marc Webb had an existing contract with Fox Searchlight Pictures to direct another film following 500 Days of Summer 2009 . After The Amazing Spider Man, Webb's negotiations with Sony Pictures Entertainment stalled because of his commitment to Fox. Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of The Amazing Spider Man, and in exchange, Sony promoted the X Men film without charge. In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the filmTrask Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014.

The film was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on digital download on September 23, 2014, and on DVD, Blu ray and Blu ray 3D on October 14, 2014. In the United Kingdom, it was released on November 10, 2014.

It added 17 minutes of previously unused footage, including a subplot involving Anna Paquin's character Rogue, whose role was reduced to a brief cameo in the theatrical release. The Rogue Cut was also screened at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con International. In the Rogue Cut, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the narrative is more complex when Kitty Pryde is accidentally wounded after Wolverine's consciousness experiences a phase between past and future from seeing Stryker in 1973, Bobby Drake Iceman proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the former X Mansion, the one place where Xavier's mind cannot reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. Xavier, Magneto, and Iceman succeed in rescuing Rogue, but at the cost of Iceman's life. Rogue uses her power to take over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels are able to find the X Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand that was severed from the X Jet during their escape. In another major scene, Mystique stops at the X Mansion the night before the Sentinel unveiling ceremony, revisits her previous romance with Beast, and destroys Cerebro the following morning in order to prevent Xavier from finding her. A new mid credits scene shows Bolivar Trask imprisoned at Magneto's former prison cell beneath the Pentagon for selling military secrets to foreign countries.

"X Men First Class stylized on screen as X First Class is a 2011 superhero film based on the X Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. The fifth installment in the X Men film series, it was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer. The film is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses on the relationship between Professor Charles Xavier James McAvoy and Erik Lehnsherr Magneto Michael Fassbender , and the origin of their groupsthe X Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw Kevin Bacon , who is bent on world domination. The film co stars Rose Byrne, January Jones, and Oliver Platt, and also introduces Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence, who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise Beast and Mystique already established in the original trilogy. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner first thought of a prequel based on the young X Men during the production of X2 producer Simon Kinberg later suggested to 20th Century Fox an adaptation of the comic series X Men First Class, although the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both X Men and X2, became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co write First Class due to his work on other projects. Vaughn, who was previously attached to both X Men The Last Stand and Thor, became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner Jane Goldman. First Class replaced a Magneto prequel film that had been in development, but had entered development hell the Writers Guild of America arbitration gave a story credit to Magneto writer Sheldon Turner. Principal photography began in August 2010 and concluded in December, with additional filming completed in April 2011. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave Desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period. First Class premiered on Ziegfeld Theatre on May 25, 2011, and was released in the United States on June 3, 2011. It was a box office success, becoming the seventh highest grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting, screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film's success re popularized the X Men film franchise with various installments following, including a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X Men characters, with X Men Days of Future Past 2014 , X Men Apocalypse 2016 , and Dark Phoenix 2019 . In 1944, in a Nazi death camp, Nazi scientist Klaus Schmidt witnesses young prisoner Erik Lehnsherr bending a metal gate with his mind when he is separated from his parents. In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, in a mansion in Westchester County, New York, child telepath Charles Xavier meets young shapeshifter Raven, whose natural form is blue skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone different , like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister. In 1962, Lehnsherr is tracking down Schmidt for vengeance, while Xavier graduates from the University of Oxford. In Las Vegas, CIA officer Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidtnow known as Sebastian Shawwith mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deployment of nuclear missiles in Turkey. Shaw, an energy absorbing mutant whose powers have de aged him, later kills Hendry by releasing the energy he absorbed previously from an explosing grenade. MacTaggert, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret Division X facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist Hank McCoy, a mutant with prehensile feet, who believes Raven's DNA may provide a cure for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant locating device Cerebro to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Lehnsherr recruit stripper Angel Salvadore, cabbie Armando Munoz, Army prisoner Alex Summers, and conceited runaway Sean Cassidy. When Frost meets with a Soviet general in the USSR, and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start a nuclear war between the US and the USSR which would accelerate, trigger global mutations and therefore lead to extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts and when Summers and Munoz retaliate, Shaw kills Munoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR install missiles in Cuba. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade. Raven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form which makes her contemplate naturism. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shawover Xavier's objectionsby forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process. Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, Xavier now using a wheelchair and his mutants are at the X Mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's helmet, frees Frost from confinement alongside Raven and introduces himself as Magneto . Other cast members include Annabelle Wallis as Amy, a young woman with heterochromia Don Creech as CIA Agent Stryker, father of Major William Stryker a character who appears in X2, X Men Origins Wolverine, X Men Days of Future Past, and X Men Apocalypse Michael Ironside Ray Wise James Remar Brendan Fehr and Aleksander Krupa also portrayed small roles in this film. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Logan Wolverine in an uncredited cameo in a bar, dismissing an approach by Xavier and Lehnsherr to join them. Jackman said he accepted the offer to appear because it sounded perfect to me , particularly for Wolverine being the only character with a swear word. X Men creator Stan Lee, who appeared in the first and third movie and regularly cameos in other Marvel based movies, explained that he was unable to participate in First Class because they shot it too far away . During the production of X2, producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed the idea of a film focusing on the young X Men with the crew, which was met with approval the concept was revived during the production of X Men The Last Stand. One of The Last Stand's writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that the original idea was to have me do a young X Men spin off, a spin off of the young X Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea ... it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X Men movie which is not what you'd expect. Around the same time, in December 2004, 20th Century Fox hired screenwriter Sheldon Turner to draft a spin off X Men film, and he chose to write Magneto, pitching it as The Pianist meets X Men. According to Turner, the script he penned was set from 1939 to 1955, following Magneto trying to survive in Auschwitz. He meets Xavier, a young soldier, during the liberation of the camp. He hunts down the Nazi war criminals who tortured him, and this lust for vengeance turns him and Xavier into enemies. In April 2007, David S. Goyer was hired to direct. The film would take place mostly in flashbacks with actors in their twenties, with Ian McKellen's older Magneto as a framing device, and some usage of the computer generated facelift applied to him in the prologue of X Men The Last Stand, McKellen reiterated his hope to open and close the film. The Magneto film was planned to shoot in Australia for a 2009 release, but it was delayed by the 200708 Writers Guild of America strike. As producer Simon Kinberg read the comic series X Men First Class, he suggested studio 20th Century Fox to adapt it. Kinberg, however, did not want to follow the comic too much, as he felt it was not fresh enough in terms of storytelling , considering them too similar to Twilight and John Hughes movies, and also because the producers wanted an adaptation that would introduce new characters. Both Kinberg and Shuler Donner said that they wanted characters with visuals and powers that had not been seen and that worked well as an ensemble, even if they did not work together in the comics. Shuler Donner later said that the original idea was to green light First Class depending on the success of X Men Origins Magneto. That project was seeking approval to film in Washington, D.C., and by December 2008, Goyer said filming would begin if X Men Origins Wolverine was successful. The story was moved forward to 1962, and involves Xavier and Magneto battling a villain. In 2008, Josh Schwartz was hired to write the screenplay, while declining the possibility of directing X Men First Class. Fox later approached Bryan Singer, director of X Men and X2, in October 2009. Schwartz later said that Singer dismissed his work as he wanted to make a very different kind of movie , with the director instead writing his own treatment which was then developed into a new script by Jamie Moss. In 2009, Ian McKellen confirmed that he would not be reprising his role as Magneto in the Origins movie citing his age, and Shuler Donner stated that the movie might never be made, stating it was at the back of the queue in the studio's priorities. Both Donner and Bryan Singer have stated that Magneto would not be produced as the plot of X Men First Class superseded the story of the planned film. Singer denied using Sheldon Turner's script for Magneto as inspiration to write his draft of First Class, but the Writers Guild of America arbitration still credited Turner for the film's story, while Moss and Schwartz's collaborations ended up uncredited. Singer set the film in a period where Xavier and Magneto were in their twenties, and seeing that it was during the 1960s, added the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, considering it would be interesting to discuss this contemporary concept in a historical context . Shuler Donner suggested the Hellfire Club as the villains. In addition to Moss, Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz were hired to rewrite the script. Miller compared it tonally to Singer's work on the first two X Men films. The pair centered the film on Xavier and Magneto's relationship, and wrote the other characters and storylines in terms of how they fit in the tension between Erik and Charles . Singer dropped out of the director's position in March 2010 due to his commitment to a Jack the Giant Killer adaptation. He formalized his duties from director to producer. The producers listed various possible directors, but at first did not consider Matthew Vaughn because he started working on The Last Stand before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film Kick Ass 2010 , Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn to see if he would be interested in First Class. When Fox offered Vaughn the chance to reboot X Men and put your stamp all over it , he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s. The director stated that First Class would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects I got my cake and ate it, managed to do an X Men movie, and a Bond thing, and a Frankenheimer political thriller at the same time . Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date. Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner Jane Goldman, adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamicsfor instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut. The character of Sunspot was also cut, as the director felt that we didn't have enough time or money to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the civil rights movement, but ultimately the director felt that I had enough political subplot in this movie . Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto. An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of Inception 2010 . Describing his thought process towards the material, Vaughn said he was motivated by unfinished business with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both X Men The Last Stand and Thor. Vaughn declared that he was more enthusiastic about First Class than The Last Stand due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to start fresh , while nodding towards the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared First Class to both Batman Begins 2005 , which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 Star Trek film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films and also that could reboot and start a whole new X Men franchise . Goldman added the film was kind of an alternate history for the X Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers did not want to go fully against the canon of the X Men trilogy , comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication. The film also rescues a central concept in the comics, the fact that radiation is one of the causes of genetic mutation in the X Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection. Principal photography began on August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street and some of the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt, and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, although just half of the climax had actually been filmed because producers realized the originally planned one was not going to work. Additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach soundstages, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had never worked under such time pressure . The film cost approximately 160 million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around 140 million. The 1960s setting of X Men First Class, technologically inspired by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they did a cool job representing the period, in a way it still felt muscular and action oriented , and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the badass, charming, ruthless and sweet personality. The director said his goal was to feel like a '60s Bond film, but with a little bit of reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time. At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the bloody hard balancing of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece. The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly that '60s misogynist vibe with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned. There is also a nod to the 1950s and 60s in the scenes set in Oxford University , starting with the heterochromia scene . These are set in a pub called the Eagle , next to the famous Bridge of Sighs in Oxford, but there is no such pub. This seems to be a reference to the Eagle pub in Cambridge, where Crick and Watson infamously announced their solution to the structure of DNA in 1953 , very relevant to the themes of the film. Vaughn said he shot the film in a way which resembled the productions of the 1960s, with very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz bang , and using the anamorphic format to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films . The director had to hire five cinematographers with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did forty five percent, fifty five percent of the filmand four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing. The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that could be done with traditional optical . The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films. The origin story made the X Men costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while still being functional, with the yellow parts resembling Kevlar and the blue looking like ballistic nylon, and resembling 1962 apparel in both the fabrics and the Space Age fashion . The costumes tried to convey the character personalitiesfor instance, Xavier wore loose clothes, and Emma Frost's costumes were white and shimmery. Magneto's costume at the film's ending also closely resembled the original version from the comics, and three versions of his helmet were made, two to fit Fassbender's head and one for Bacon's. First Class employed 1,150 visual effects shots, which was done by six companies Rhythm and Hues was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions Cinesite handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects Luma Pictures did Banshee, Havok and Darwin Moving Picture Company did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine Digital Domain created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and Weta Digital was responsible for the climactic battle in Cuba. The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer John Dykstra, who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule It was slightly less than a year and I've never done anything like that before Spider Man was frequently two years . British company 4dMax employed special 3D scanners to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies. This allowed for computer generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in Enter the Dragon as a referenceand the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities, with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 Red Square, and a digital army doing an actual Soviet style march. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships shot on a small bridge set and the X Jet done on a set replicating the front two thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified SR 71 Blackbird, the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960sthough a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the Kresta I and II, leading Weta to dub it the Kresta III. Practical effects were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams. While in the comics Shaw's absorption power was depicted by having him grow up to ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a kinetic echo , where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated iterations that appear in a short period, to see displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way . According to Dykstra, the biggest problem with Frost's diamond body was depicting it without looking like she was made of Jell O or the polygon model of a human being . The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on going in and out of her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrorswhich also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to make the wings prettier . The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the inky smoky effects used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke because he was more closely aligned with the devil . The fire was also used as a mask to hide or reveal the body , according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca. For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed. Henry Jackman, who had worked with Vaughn in Kick Ass, composed the score. Following the James Bond influences on First Class, Jackman drew inspiration from John Barry's work in the said series, which he described as extremely posh pop music . Jackman started his work with a Superman style theme , which is only featured in the final parts of the film as Vaughn thought it was too successful and triumphant for a disjointed and up and coming team. Therefore, Vaughn reworked a 'stretched' half time version of the theme into the remainder of the film. The themes for Magneto and Shaw have similarities to reflect their perverted father son relationship, with even a seamless transition during the scene where Shaw is killed to represent Lensherr's full transformation into Magneto. The track Rage and Serenity is reused in Vaughn's 2017 film Kingsman The Golden Circle. In a roundtable interview with multiple news outlets, Vaughn responded to a question about choosing Love Love by the British band Take That for the end credits theme, explaining, I bumped into lead singer Gary Barlow in Los Angeles, and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it ' And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, 'I think it'll be a hit', and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it's pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film. An instrumental of the song Run I'm a Natural Disaster by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene. All music is composed by Henry Jackman. The premiere for X Men First Class took place at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, on May 25, 2011. The promotional campaign aimed for non traditional partners, with Fox signing deals with Farmers Insurance Group, BlackBerry PlayBook and the U.S. Army. Wrigley Australia issued an X Men themed edition of their 5 chewing gum. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 86 based on 285 reviews, with an average rating of 7.37 10. The site's critical consensus reads, With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well rounded cast, X Men First Class is a welcome return to form for the franchise. On Metacritic, the film received a score of 65 out of 100, based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews . Among the major trade publications, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy , and said that director Vaughn impressively maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power ... and orchestrates the mayhem with a laudable coherence, a task made easier by a charging, churning score by Henry Jackman ... . Justin Chang of Variety said the film feels swift, sleek and remarkably coherent , and that the visual effects designed by John Dykstra are smoothly and imaginatively integrated ... Frank Lovece of Film Journal International lauded a wickedly smart script with a multilayered theme that ... never loses sight of its ultimate story, and makes each emotional motivation interlock, often shockingly playing for keeps with its characters. This is not a kids' movie. In consumer publications, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised the kind of youthful, Brit knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed from his previous collaborations as producer of director Guy Ritchie's bloke y larks , and found McAvoy and Fassbender a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic book work. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star called it a blockbuster with brains and said Vaughn brings similar freshness to this comic creation as he did to Kick Ass, and manages to do so while hewing to the saga's serious dramatic intent.

"X ray crystallography XRC is the experimental science determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline structure causes a beam of incident X rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their crystallographic disorder, and various other information. Since many materials can form crystalssuch as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, as well as various inorganic, organic, and biological moleculesX ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X ray crystallography is still the primary method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or serve as the basis for designing pharmaceuticals against diseases. In a single crystal X ray diffraction measurement, a crystal is mounted on a goniometer. The goniometer is used to position the crystal at selected orientations. The crystal is illuminated with a finely focused monochromatic beam of X rays, producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as reflections. The two dimensional images taken at different orientations are converted into a three dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier transforms, combined with chemical data known for the sample. Poor resolution fuzziness or even errors may result if the crystals are too small, or not uniform enough in their internal makeup. X ray crystallography is related to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X ray methods can be applied to obtain less detailed information such methods include fiber diffraction, powder diffraction and if the sample is not crystallized small angle X ray scattering SAXS . If the material under investigation is only available in the form of nanocrystalline powders or suffers from poor crystallinity, the methods of electron crystallography can be applied for determining the atomic structure. For all above mentioned X ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic the scattered X rays have the same wavelength as the incoming X ray. By contrast, inelastic X ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample such as plasmons, crystal field and orbital excitations, magnons, and phonons, rather than the distribution of its atoms. Crystals, though long admired for their regularity and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized in his work Strena seu de Nive Sexangula A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow 1611 that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystals was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles. The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno 1669 pioneered experimental investigations of crystal symmetry. Steno showed that the angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal, and Rene Just Hauy 1784 discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Hauy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three dimensional array a Bravais lattice of atoms and molecules a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schonflies and belatedly William Barlow 1894 . From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X ray crystallography however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive. Wilhelm Rontgen discovered X rays in 1895, just as the studies of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain of the nature of X rays, but soon suspected correctly that they were waves of electromagnetic radiationin other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of lightspecifically, the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiationwas well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that X rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, X rays are composed of photons, and thus are not only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X rays from electrons. Therefore, these particle like properties of X rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X rays were not electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that X rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation. Crystals are regular arrays of atoms, and X rays can be considered waves of electromagnetic radiation. Atoms scatter X ray waves, primarily through the atoms' electrons. Just as an ocean wave striking a lighthouse produces secondary circular waves emanating from the lighthouse, so an X ray striking an electron produces secondary spherical waves emanating from the electron. This phenomenon is known as elastic scattering, and the electron or lighthouse is known as the scatterer. A regular array of scatterers produces a regular array of spherical waves. Although these waves cancel one another out in most directions through destructive interference, they add constructively in a few specific directions, determined by Bragg's law Here d is the spacing between diffracting planes, displaystyle theta is the incident angle, n is any integer, and is the wavelength of the beam. These specific directions appear as spots on the diffraction pattern called reflections. Thus, X ray diffraction results from an electromagnetic wave the X ray impinging on a regular array of scatterers the repeating arrangement of atoms within the crystal . X rays are used to produce the diffraction pattern because their wavelength is typically the same order of magnitude 1100 angstroms as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength typically, 5500 angstroms to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty. The idea that crystals could be used as a diffraction grating for X rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914. As described in the mathematical derivation below, the X ray scattering is determined by the density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Thomson scattering for one particle with mass m and elementary charge q is Hence the atomic nuclei, which are much heavier than an electron, contribute negligibly to the scattered X rays. After Von Laue's pioneering research, the field developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg. In 19121913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two and three dimensional arrangements of atoms in the unit cell. The potential of X ray crystallography for determining the structure of molecules and mineralsthen only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experimentswas realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic resolution structure to be solved i.e., determined in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of CC single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride CaF2, also known as fluorite , calcite CaCO3 and pyrite FeS2 in 1914 spinel MgAl2O4 in 1915 the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide TiO2 in 1916 pyrochroite Mn OH 2 and, by extension, brucite Mg OH 2 in 1919 . Also in 1919 sodium nitrate NaNO3 and caesium dichloroiodide CsICl2 were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite hexagonal ZnS structure became known in 1920. The structure of graphite was solved in 1916 by the related method of powder diffraction, which was developed by Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer and, independently, by Albert Hull in 1917. The structure of graphite was determined from single crystal diffraction in 1924 by two groups independently. Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of various metals, such as iron and magnesium. In what has been called his scientific autobiography, The Development of X ray Analysis, Sir William Lawrence Bragg mentioned that he believed the field of crystallography was particularly welcoming to women because the techno aesthetics of the molecular structures resembled textiles and household objects. Bragg was known to compare crystal formation to curtains, wallpapers, mosaics, and roses . In 1951, the Festival Pattern Group at the Festival of Britain hosted a collaborative group of textile manufacturers and experienced crystallographers to design lace and prints based on the X ray crystallography of insulin, china clay, and hemoglobin. One of the leading scientists of the project was Dr. Helen Megaw 19072002 , the Assistant Director of Research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge at the time. Megaw is credited as one of the central figures who took inspiration from crystal diagrams and saw their potential in design. In 2008, the Wellcome Collection in London curated an exhibition on the Festival Pattern Group called From Atom to Patterns . X ray crystallography has led to a better understanding of chemical bonds and non covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate IV , and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic CC bonds and aromatic CC bonds this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement. Also in the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt and later Linus Pauling developed rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and for determining the relative sizes of atoms. These rules led to the structure of brookite 1928 and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile, brookite and anatase forms of titanium dioxide. The distance between two bonded atoms is a sensitive measure of the bond strength and its bond order thus, X ray crystallographic studies have led to the discovery of even more exotic types of bonding in inorganic chemistry, such as metal metal double bonds, metal metal quadruple bonds, and three center, two electron bonds. X ray crystallographyor, strictly speaking, an inelastic Compton scattering experimenthas also provided evidence for the partly covalent character of hydrogen bonds. In the field of organometallic chemistry, the X ray structure of ferrocene initiated scientific studies of sandwich compounds, while that of Zeise's salt stimulated research into back bonding and metal pi complexes. Finally, X ray crystallography had a pioneering role in the development of supramolecular chemistry, particularly in clarifying the structures of the crown ethers and the principles of hostguest chemistry. X ray diffraction is a very powerful tool in catalyst development. Ex situ measurements are carried out routinely for checking the crystal structure of materials or to unravel new structures. In situ experiments give comprehensive understanding about the structural stability of catalysts under reaction conditions. In material sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic systems have been analyzed using single crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 1,000,000 structures as of June 2019 over 99 of these structures were determined by X ray diffraction. Since the 1920s, X ray diffraction has been the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of X ray crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X ray crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The first application of X ray crystallography to metallurgy likewise occurred in the mid 1920s. Most notably, Linus Pauling's structure of the alloy Mg2Sn led to his theory of the stability and structure of complex ionic crystals. On October 17, 2012, the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars at Rocknest performed the first X ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil. The results from the rover's CheMin analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the weathered basaltic soils of Hawaiian volcanoes. The first structure of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved in 1923. This was followed by several studies of long chain fatty acids, which are an important component of biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the structure of phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that is closely related to porphyrin molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll. X ray crystallography of biological molecules took off with Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, who solved the structures of cholesterol 1937 , penicillin 1946 and vitamin B12 1956 , for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. In 1969, she succeeded in solving the structure of insulin, on which she worked for over thirty years. Crystal structures of proteins which are irregular and hundreds of times larger than cholesterol began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 139132 X ray crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones less than 70 kDa . X ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals. On the other end of the size scale, even relatively small molecules may pose challenges for the resolving power of X ray crystallography. The structure assigned in 1991 to the antibiotic isolated from a marine organism, diazonamide A C40H34Cl2N6O6, molar mass 765.65 g mol , proved to be incorrect by the classical proof of structure a synthetic sample was not identical to the natural product. The mistake was attributed to the inability of X ray crystallography to distinguish between the correct OH NH and the interchanged NH2 O groups in the incorrect structure. With advances in instrumentation, however, it is now routinely possible to distinguish between such similar groups using modern single crystal X ray diffractometers. Despite being an invaluable tool in structural biology, protein crystallography carries some inherent problems that emerge from the very nature of the methodology and hinder the accurate translation of scientific results. The crystal lattice, which is formed during the crystallization process, contains numerous units of the purified protein, which are densely and symmetrically packed in the crystal. When looking for a previously unknown protein, figuring out its shape and boundaries within the crystal lattice can be challenging. Due to the fact that proteins are usually assembled from smaller subunits, the task of distinguishing between the different molecular unit formations and identifying the actual protein, can be challenging even for the experienced crystallographers. These non biological interfaces that occur during crystallization are known as crystal packing contacts or simply, crystal contacts and cannot be distinguished by crystallographic means. When a new protein structure is solved by X ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, its authors are requested to specify the biological assembly which would constitute the functional, biologically relevant protein. However, errors, missing data and inaccurate annotations during the submission of the data, give rise to obscure structures and compromise the reliability of the database. The error rate in the case of faulty annotations alone, has been reported to be upwards of 6,6 or approximately 15 , arguably a non trivial size considering the rising number of deposited structures. This interface classification problem is typically tackled by computational approaches and it has grown into a recognized subject in structural bioinformatics. X ray crystallography is a form of elastic scattering the outgoing X rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy or increases the wavelength of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X ray crystallography. X rays range in wavelength from 10 to 0.01 nanometers a typical wavelength used for crystallography is 1 A 0.1 nm , which is on the scale of covalent chemical bonds and the radius of a single atom. Longer wavelength photons such as ultraviolet radiation would not have sufficient resolution to determine the atomic positions. At the other extreme, shorter wavelength photons such as gamma rays are difficult to produce in large numbers, difficult to focus, and interact too strongly with matter, producing particle antiparticle pairs. Therefore, X rays are the sweetspot for wavelength when determining atomic resolution structures from the scattering of electromagnetic radiation. Other forms of elastic X ray scattering include powder diffraction, Small Angle X ray Scattering SAXS and several types of X ray fiber diffraction, which was used by Rosalind Franklin in determining the double helix structure of DNA. In general, single crystal X ray diffraction offers more structural information than these other techniques however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available. These scattering methods generally use monochromatic X rays, which are restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X rays that is, a blend of X rays with different wavelengths can also be used to carry out X ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events Time resolved crystallography . However, it is not as well suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements. The Laue back reflection mode records X rays scattered backwards from a broad spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart can be used to interpret the back reflection Laue photograph. Other particles, such as electrons and neutrons, may be used to produce a diffraction pattern. Although electron, neutron, and X ray scattering are based on different physical processes, the resulting diffraction patterns are analyzed using the same coherent diffraction imaging techniques. As derived below, the electron density within the crystal and the diffraction patterns are related by a simple mathematical method, the Fourier transform, which allows the density to be calculated relatively easily from the patterns. However, this works only if the scattering is weak, i.e., if the scattered beams are much less intense than the incoming beam. Weakly scattered beams pass through the remainder of the crystal without undergoing a second scattering event. Such re scattered waves are called secondary scattering and hinder the analysis. Any sufficiently thick crystal will produce secondary scattering, but since X rays interact relatively weakly with the electrons, this is generally not a significant concern. By contrast, electron beams may produce strong secondary scattering even for relatively thin crystals 100 nm . Since this thickness corresponds to the diameter of many viruses, a promising direction is the electron diffraction of isolated macromolecular assemblies, such as viral capsids and molecular machines, which may be carried out with a cryo electron microscope. Moreover, the strong interaction of electrons with matter about 1000 times stronger than for X rays allows determination of the atomic structure of extremely small volumes. The field of applications for electron crystallography ranges from bio molecules like membrane proteins over organic thin films to the complex structures of nanocrystalline intermetallic compounds and zeolites. Neutron diffraction is an excellent method for structure determination, although it has been difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O. The oldest and most precise method of X ray crystallography is single crystal X ray diffraction, in which a beam of X rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land on a piece of film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations. The technique of single crystal X ray crystallography has three basic steps. The firstand often most difficultstep is to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large typically larger than 0.1 mm in all dimensions , pure in composition and regular in structure, with no significant internal imperfections such as cracks or twinning. In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X rays, usually of a single wavelength monochromatic X rays , producing the regular pattern of reflections. The angles and intensities of diffracted X rays are measured, with each compound having a unique diffraction pattern. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections. In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. The final, refined model of the atomic arrangementnow called a crystal structureis usually stored in a public database. As the crystal's repeating unit, its unit cell, becomes larger and more complex, the atomic level picture provided by X ray crystallography becomes less well resolved more fuzzy for a given number of observed reflections. Two limiting cases of X ray crystallography small molecule which includes continuous inorganic solids and macromolecular crystallographyare often discerned. Small molecule crystallography typically involves crystals with fewer than 100 atoms in their asymmetric unit such crystal structures are usually so well resolved that the atoms can be discerned as isolated blobs of electron density. By contrast, macromolecular crystallography often involves tens of thousands of atoms in the unit cell. Such crystal structures are generally less well resolved more smeared out the atoms and chemical bonds appear as tubes of electron density, rather than as isolated atoms. In general, small molecules are also easier to crystallize than macromolecules however, X ray crystallography has proven possible even for viruses and proteins with hundreds of thousands of atoms, through improved crystallographic imaging and technology. Though normally X ray crystallography can only be performed if the sample is in crystal form, new research has been done into sampling non crystalline forms of samples. Although crystallography can be used to characterize the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic resolution structure. Small molecule and macromolecular crystallography differ in the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded. Protein crystals are almost always grown in solution. The most common approach is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually if this is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a useless dust or amorphous gel on the bottom of the container. Crystal growth in solution is characterized by two steps nucleation of a microscopic crystallite possibly having only 100 molecules , followed by growth of that crystallite, ideally to a diffraction quality crystal. The solution conditions that favor the first step nucleation are not always the same conditions that favor the second step subsequent growth . The crystallographer's goal is to identify solution conditions that favor the development of a single, large crystal, since larger crystals offer improved resolution of the molecule. Consequently, the solution conditions should disfavor the first step nucleation but favor the second growth , so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the droplet, rather than one large crystal if favored too little, no crystal will form whatsoever. Other approaches involves, crystallizing proteins under oil, where aqueous protein solutions are dispensed under liquid oil, and water evaporates through the layer of oil. Different oils have different evaporation permeabilities, therefore yielding changes in concentration rates from different percipient protein mixture. It is extremely difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule s to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities milligrams of crystallization grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10 fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand in the order of 1 microliter . Several factors are known to inhibit or mar crystallization. The growing crystals are generally held at a constant temperature and protected from shocks or vibrations that might disturb their crystallization. Impurities in the molecules or in the crystallization solutions are often inimical to crystallization. Conformational flexibility in the molecule also tends to make crystallization less likely, due to entropy. Molecules that tend to self assemble into regular helices are often unwilling to assemble into crystals. Crystals can be marred by twinning, which can occur when a unit cell can pack equally favorably in multiple orientations although recent advances in computational methods may allow solving the structure of some twinned crystals. Having failed to crystallize a target molecule, a crystallographer may try again with a slightly modified version of the molecule even small changes in molecular properties can lead to large differences in crystallization behavior. The crystal is mounted for measurements so that it may be held in the X ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution the mother liquor . Nowadays, crystals of small molecules are typically attached with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod. Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal motion the Debye Waller effect . However, untreated protein crystals often crack if flash frozen therefore, they are generally pre soaked in a cryoprotectant solution before freezing. Unfortunately, this pre soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo conditions are identified by trial and error. The capillary or loop is mounted on a goniometer, which allows it to be positioned accurately within the X ray beam and rotated. Since both the crystal and the beam are often very small, the crystal must be centered within the beam to within 25 micrometers accuracy, which is aided by a camera focused on the crystal. The most common type of goniometer is the kappa goniometer , which offers three angles of rotation the angle, which rotates about an axis perpendicular to the beam the angle, about an axis at 50 to the axis and, finally, the angle about the loop capillary axis. When the angle is zero, the and axes are aligned. The rotation allows for convenient mounting of the crystal, since the arm in which the crystal is mounted may be swung out towards the crystallographer. The oscillations carried out during data collection mentioned below involve the axis only. An older type of goniometer is the four circle goniometer, and its relatives such as the six circle goniometer. Small scale can be done on a local X ray tube source, typically coupled with an image plate detector. These have the advantage of being relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of 50 kV having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong K and K lines. The K line is sometimes suppressed with a thin 10 m nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X ray tube has a stationary anode the Crookes tube and run with 2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating anode type source that run with 14 kW of e beam power. X rays are generally filtered by use of X ray filters to a single wavelength made monochromatic and collimated to a single direction before they are allowed to strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a collimator basically, a long tube or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals under 0.3 mm or with large unit cells over 150 A . Rotating anodes were used by Joanna Joka Maria Vandenberg in the first experiments that demonstrated the power of X rays for quick in real time production screening of large InGaAsP thin film wafers for quality control of quantum well lasers. Synchrotron radiation sources are some of the brightest lights on earth. It is the single most powerful tool available to X ray crystallographers. It is made of X ray beams generated in large machines called synchrotrons. These machines accelerate electrically charged particles, often electrons, to nearly the speed of light and confine them in a roughly circular loop using magnetic fields. Synchrotrons are generally national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally designed for use by high energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons' path is bent, they emit bursts of energy in the form of X rays. Using synchrotron radiation frequently has specific requirements for X ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures 100 K . However, synchrotron radiation frequently has the advantage of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD. Recently, free electron lasers have been developed for use in X ray crystallography. These are the brightest X ray sources currently available with the X rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected in order to get a complete data set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources. When a crystal is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X rays, it scatters the X rays into a pattern of spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector such as a pixel detector or with a charge coupled device CCD image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high resolution data thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point. One image of spots is insufficient to reconstruct the whole crystal it represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step by step through 180, with an image recorded at every step actually, slightly more than 180 is required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the Ewald sphere. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90 or 45 may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a blind spot in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly by 0.52 to catch a broader region of reciprocal space. Multiple data sets may be necessary for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three and usually four, for redundancy wavelengths of the incoming X ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken. The recorded series of two dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding to a different crystal orientation, is converted into a three dimensional model of the electron density the conversion uses the mathematical technique of Fourier transforms, which is explained below. Each spot corresponds to a different type of variation in the electron density the crystallographer must determine which variation corresponds to which spot indexing , the relative strengths of the spots in different images merging and scaling and how the variations should be combined to yield the total electron density phasing . Data processing begins with indexing the reflections. This means identifying the dimensions of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of at the very least records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image . A full data set may consist of hundreds of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The first step is to merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images merging and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry related R factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data. The data collected from a diffraction experiment is a reciprocal space representation of the crystal lattice. The position of each diffraction 'spot' is governed by the size and shape of the unit cell, and the inherent symmetry within the crystal. The intensity of each diffraction 'spot' is recorded, and this intensity is proportional to the square of the structure factor amplitude. The structure factor is a complex number containing information relating to both the amplitude and phase of a wave. In order to obtain an interpretable electron density map, both amplitude and phase must be known an electron density map allows a crystallographer to build a starting model of the molecule . The phase cannot be directly recorded during a diffraction experiment this is known as the phase problem. Initial phase estimates can be obtained in a variety of ways Having obtained initial phases, an initial model can be built. The atomic positions in the model and their respective Debye Waller factors or B factors, accounting for the thermal motion of the atom can be refined to fit the observed diffraction data, ideally yielding a better set of phases. A new model can then be fit to the new electron density map and successive rounds of refinement is carried out. This interative process continues until the correlation between the diffraction data and the model is maximized. The agreement is measured by an R factor defined as where F is the structure factor. A similar quality criterion is Rfree, which is calculated from a subset 10 of reflections that were not included in the structure refinement. Both R factors depend on the resolution of the data. As a rule of thumb, Rfree should be approximately the resolution in angstroms divided by 10 thus, a data set with 2 A resolution should yield a final Rfree 0.2. Chemical bonding features such as stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding and distribution of bond lengths and angles are complementary measures of the model quality. Phase bias is a serious problem in such iterative model building. Omit maps are a common technique used to check for this. It may not be possible to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, Crystallographic disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple 4 allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization. A common challenge in refinement of crystal structures results from crystallographic disorder. Disorder can take many forms but in general involves the coexistence of two or more species or conformations. Failure to recognize disorder results in flawed interpretation. Pitfalls from improper modeling of disorder are illustrated by the discounted hypothesis of bond stretch isomerism. Disorder is modelled with respect to the relative population of the components, often only two, and their identity. In structures of large molecules and ions, solvent and counterions are often disordered. The use of computational methods for the powder X ray diffraction data analysis is now generalized. It typically compares the experimental data to the simulated diffractogram of a model structure, taking into account the instrumental parameters, and refines the structural or microstructural parameters of the model using least squares based minimization algorithm. Most available tools allowing phase identification and structural refinement are based on the Rietveld method, some of them being open and free software such as FullProf Suite, Jana2006, MAUD, Rietan, GSAS, etc. while others are available under commercials licenses such as Diffrac.Suite TOPAS, Match , etc. Most of these tools also allow Le Bail refinement also referred to as profile matching , that is, refinement of the cell parameters based on the Bragg peaks positions and peak profiles, without taking into account the crystallographic structure by itself. More recent tools allow the refinement of both structural and microstructural data, such as the FAULTS program included in the FullProf Suite, which allows the refinement of structures with planar defects e.g. stacking faults, twinnings, intergrowths . Once the model of a molecule's structure has been finalized, it is often deposited in a crystallographic database such as the Cambridge Structural Database for small molecules , the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database ICSD for inorganic compounds or the Protein Data Bank for protein and sometimes nucleic acids . Many structures obtained in private commercial ventures to crystallize medicinally relevant proteins are not deposited in public crystallographic databases. The main goal of X ray crystallography is to determine the density of electrons f r throughout the crystal, where r represents the three dimensional position vector within the crystal. To do this, X ray scattering is used to collect data about its Fourier transform F q , which is inverted mathematically to obtain the density defined in real space, using the formula where the integral is taken over all values of q. The three dimensional real vector q represents a point in reciprocal space, that is, to a particular oscillation in the electron density as one moves in the direction in which q points. The length of q corresponds to 2 displaystyle 2 pi divided by the wavelength of the oscillation. The corresponding formula for a Fourier transform will be used below where the integral is summed over all possible values of the position vector r within the crystal. The Fourier transform F q is generally a complex number, and therefore has a magnitude F q and a phase q related by the equation The intensities of the reflections observed in X ray diffraction give us the magnitudes F q but not the phases q . To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering i.e., electron dense metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F q , which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f r . Crystals are often idealized as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F q is zero except when q belongs to the reciprocal lattice the so called Bragg peaks . In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic atoms vibrate about their mean position, and there may be disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X rays that fall between the Bragg peaks. An intuitive understanding of X ray diffraction can be obtained from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices h, k, l , and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X rays are scattered specularly mirror like from each plane from that assumption, X rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively constructive interference when the angle between the plane and the X ray results in a path length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X ray wavelength . A reflection is said to be indexed when its Miller indices or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2. Such indexing gives the unit cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit cell for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out. The incoming X ray beam has a polarization and should be represented as a vector wave however, for simplicity, let it be represented here as a scalar wave. We also ignore the complication of the time dependence of the wave and just concentrate on the wave's spatial dependence. Plane waves can be represented by a wave vector kin, and so the strength of the incoming wave at time t 0 is given by At position r within the sample, let there be a density of scatterers f r these scatterers should produce a scattered spherical wave of amplitude proportional to the local amplitude of the incoming wave times the number of scatterers in a small volume dV about r where S is the proportionality constant. Consider the fraction of scattered waves that leave with an outgoing wave vector of kout and strike the screen at rscreen. Since no energy is lost elastic, not inelastic scattering , the wavelengths are the same as are the magnitudes of the wave vectors kin kout . From the time that the photon is scattered at r until it is absorbed at rscreen, the photon undergoes a change in phase The net radiation arriving at rscreen is the sum of all the scattered waves throughout the crystal which may be written as a Fourier transform where q kout kin. The measured intensity of the reflection will be square of this amplitude For every reflection corresponding to a point q in the reciprocal space, there is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point q. This opposite reflection is known as the Friedel mate of the original reflection. This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons f r at a position r is always a real number. As noted above, f r is the inverse transform of its Fourier transform F q however, such an inverse transform is a complex number in general. To ensure that f r is real, the Fourier transform F q must be such that the Friedel mates F q and F q are complex conjugates of one another. Thus, F q has the same magnitude as F q but they have the opposite phase, i.e., q q The equality of their magnitudes ensures that the Friedel mates have the same intensity F 2. This symmetry allows one to measure the full Fourier transform from only half the reciprocal space, e.g., by rotating the crystal slightly more than 180 instead of a full 360 revolution. In crystals with significant symmetry, even more reflections may have the same intensity Bijvoet mates in such cases, even less of the reciprocal space may need to be measured. In favorable cases of high symmetry, sometimes only 90 or even only 45 of data are required to completely explore the reciprocal space. The Friedel mate constraint can be derived from the definition of the inverse Fourier transform Since Euler's formula states that eix cos x i sin x , the inverse Fourier transform can be separated into a sum of a purely real part and a purely imaginary part The function f r is real if and only if the second integral Isin is zero for all values of r. In turn, this is true if and only if the above constraint is satisfied since Isin Isin implies that Isin 0. Each X ray diffraction image represents only a slice, a spherical slice of reciprocal space, as may be seen by the Ewald sphere construction. Both kout and kin have the same length, due to the elastic scattering, since the wavelength has not changed. Therefore, they may be represented as two radial vectors in a sphere in reciprocal space, which shows the values of q that are sampled in a given diffraction image. Since there is a slight spread in the incoming wavelengths of the incoming X ray beam, the values of F q can be measured only for q vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to those radii. Therefore, to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data, it is necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180, or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry is present. A full 360 rotation is not needed because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions such as the electron density , but slightly more than 180 is needed to cover all of reciprocal space within a given resolution because of the curvature of the Ewald sphere. In practice, the crystal is rocked by a small amount 0.251 to incorporate reflections near the boundaries of the spherical Ewald's shells. A well known result of Fourier transforms is the autocorrelation theorem, which states that the autocorrelation c r of a function f r has a Fourier transform C q that is the squared magnitude of F q Therefore, the autocorrelation function c r of the electron density also known as the Patterson function can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this could be used to determine the crystal structure directly however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The autocorrelation function corresponds to the distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal thus, a crystal of N atoms in its unit cell may have N N 1 peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors, this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals. In principle, an atomic structure could be determined from applying X ray scattering to non crystalline samples, even to a single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This is an example of constructive interference. In a liquid, powder or amorphous sample, molecules within that sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude thereby reducing the measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically in at least one dimension. X ray diffraction has wide and various applications in the chemical, biochemical, physical, material and mineralogical sciences. Laue claimed in 1937 that the technique has extended the power of observing minute structure ten thousand times beyond that given us by the microscope . X ray diffraction is analogous to a microscope with atomic level resolution which shows the atoms and their electron distribution. X ray diffraction, electron diffraction, and neutron diffraction give information about the structure of matter, crystalline and non crystalline, at the atomic and molecular level. In addition, these methods may be applied in the study of properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due to the importance and variety of applications of diffraction studies of crystals, many Nobel Prizes have been awarded for such studies. X ray diffraction has been used for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as eight lactam ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium , three tetracycline doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride and two macrolide azithromycin, erythromycin estolate antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique X Ray Diffraction XRD pattern that makes their identification possible. Forensic examination of any trace evidence is based upon Locard's exchange principle. This states that every contact leaves a trace . In practice, even though a transfer of material has taken place, it may be impossible to detect, because the amount transferred is very small. Textile fibers are a mixture of crystalline and amorphous substances. Therefore, the measurement of the degree of crystalline gives useful data in the characterization of fibers using X ray diffractometry. It has been reported that X ray diffraction was used to identify of a crystalline deposit which was found on a chair. The deposit was found to be amorphous, but the diffraction pattern present matched that of polymethylmethacrylate. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry later identified the deposit as polymethylcyanoacrylaon of Boin crystal parameters. Heating or burning of bones causes recognizable changes in the bone mineral that can be detected using XRD techniques. During the first 15 minutes of heating at 500 C or above, the bone crystals began to change. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when the samples were heated at a lower temperature or for a shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters. X ray diffraction has been demonstrated as a method for investigating the complex structure of integrated circuits.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray%20crystallography
"X A Fabulous Child's Story, written by Lois Gould, was first published as a short story in the magazine Ms. in 1972 and then illustrated by Jacqueline Chwast and republished by Daughters Publishing as a picture book in 1978. The book tells the story of X, a child raised as part of an experiment to keep its gender unknown to everyone but its parents and the scientists conducting the experiment. X A Fabulous Child's Story received praise for its thought provoking conceit and witty prose. Meanwhile, some writers have questioned the extent to which the story successfully challenges gender roles. X A Fabulous Child's Story is sometimes considered a precursor to later picture books about transgender characters, and it has been anthologized several times. The story inspired a 1975 experiment and was adapted into an animated short film in 2016. As part of a scientific experiment, a baby is born and its gender is kept a secret from the world. This child, Baby X, is adopted by Ms. and Mr. Jones, who promise to raise the child without imbuing it with traditional gender roles. The Joneses raise X by mixing toys and clothes meant for both girls and boys. When X begins school, its classmates try to determine X's gender but are unable to do so. X excels in all areas of its schooling and remains kind and caring to classmates, ultimately leading them to begin rejecting normative gender roles as well. The parents of X's schoolmates become concerned and forbid them from playing with X. At a meeting of the Parents' Association, they decide X must be examined by an impartial group of experts. Upon examination, the experts announce that X is perfectly healthy and well adjusted, and that its gender will be known one day. The Parents' Association reluctantly abides by the determination of the experts and allows their children once more to play with X. The children go to visit X later on and find it playing with its new baby sibling, Y. Lois Gould was a journalist and author who had written one novel, Such Good Friends, in 1970. In 1972, the feminist magazine Ms. began its print run. In December 1972 Ms. published Gould's short story X A Fabulous Child's Story in the Stories for Free Children column in its sixth issue. The story was revised, illustrated, and republished by Daughters Publishing as a 52 page hardcover picture book on July 18, 1978. The artwork was done by Jacqueline Chwast, a freelance visual artist who was known for an illustration style evoking woodcut but that in actuality employed negative space cut from black construction paper. Gould knew of Chwast's artwork and hoped she would illustrate X A Fabulous Child's Story. Interested in the themes of the story, Chwast agreed to do the illustrations after Gould contacted her. Reviewing the work for The Village Voice, Eliot Fremont Smith found X A Fabulous Child's Story to offer a fable of possibility supporting the courage to be oneself and acceptance of individual eccentricity and wrote that the story's conclusion was a rather nice verbal jokewith just a whiff of cloning . Publishers Weekly gave the story a positive review, describing the book as witty, innovative, and sophisticated and likely to stimulate discussion. The educator Roseanne Hoefel praised Gould's prose and humor for their keen wit and energy and described the story as popular among college students in her classes. The English and gender studies professor Nat Hurley praised the book for declining to reveal X's gender to the reader and allowing X to simply exist as ambiguously gendered. Fremont Smith also described the work as both condescending and authoritarian for the way the story treated the viewpoints of the other parents and the other schoolchildren. He described Chwast's illustrations as only occasionally ominous . Some writers have been critical of the extent to which X A Fabulous Child's Story actually challenges gender roles. Fremont Smith wrote that the affluence of the Joneses and their ability to provide all the toys X desires suggest that sexual liberation and capitalism are compatible with one another. Hurley wrote that the determination of the experts that X was well adjusted does not force any of the resistant parents to change a single thing about their own rigidly gendered child rearing practices . The language scholar Paramita Ayuningtyas described the ending of the story as ironic, with the introduction of X's sibling Y suggesting a binary XY sex determination system that reifies gender essentialism. Some scholars of children's literature consider X A Fabulous Child's Story to be part of the lineage of modern children's books with transgender themes, even though the story does not explicitly deal with transgender identity. While Fremont Smith wrote in his 1978 review of the book that Chwast illustrated X wearing exclusively overalls to avoid the taint of transsexualism or campy drag , Jamie Campbell Naidoo wrote in 2012 that X A Fabulous Child's Story may be a precursor to newer works which do feature explicitly transgender children, like Marcus Ewert's 10,000 Dresses. Similarly, Julia L. Mickenberg and Philip Nel described X A Fabulous Child's Story as the first picture book that was sympathetic to trans people while Robert Bittner, Jennifer Ingrey, and Christine Stamper wrote that it was the first picture book to include a non gendered child as one of its characters. X A Fabulous Child's Story was Gould's only story for children. The story has variously been anthologized as radical children's literature and as feminist science fiction, and has also been collected in social psychology and gender studies readers. The story partially inspired an experiment by three City University of New York researchers to test the effects of introducing an infant to adults without identifying its gender their work was reported in the journal Sex Roles in 1975. X A Fabulous Child's Story has been reported to be difficult to find copies of in the 2010s. In 2016, the picture book was adapted into an animated short film entitled Baby X and directed by Brendan Bradley. The 11 minute film received praise from Joe Blevins of The A.V. Club who wrote that its animation style succeeded in mimicking the visual style of its source text, and from Kristina Marusic of NewNowNext, who described it as both beautiful and poignant .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%3A%20A%20Fabulous%20Child%27s%20Story
"HM Submarine X1 was conceived and designed as a submersible commerce raider for the Royal Navy at the time of her launching she was the largest submarine in the world. For Britain, the idea of a submarine cruiser had been proposed as early as 1915, but the type was not put into practice until 1921. X1, which was based on the uncompleted German U 173 class of 2,000 ton U cruisers , was laid down on 2 November 1921 at the Naval Dockyard Chatham and completed on 23 September 1925, commissioning in December 1925. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, of which Britain was a signatory, did not ban submarines but it did ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1's unacknowledged purpose its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, a certain amount of secrecy surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized. The X1's 1 inch 25 mm thick pressure hull was 19 feet 7.5 inches 5.982 m in diameter amidships, and was divided into 10 water tight compartments. This was almost completely surrounded by her external hull, which also contained the main ballast tanks and most of her fuel. Her intended maximum diving depth was 500 feet 150 m , but was reduced to 350 feet 110 m once in service. She was expected to sink her targets using gunfire and so was given four 5.2 inch 130 mm guns to be able to defeat a destroyer or armed merchant ship, although she was fitted with six bow tubes for 21 inch 530 mm torpedoes to supplement her guns. X1 carried four QF 5.2 inch Mk I guns in twin unarmoured turrets, one forward and one aft of the conning tower. They had a range of about 16,000 yards 15,000 m . A circular trunk ran from each mounting to the magazine in the pressure hull which contained 100 rounds per gun. A working chamber which was 10 feet 3.0 m in diameter encircled the trunk between the pressure hull and the gun mount. Her ammunition hoists were problematic and could not sustain the desired rate of fire of six rounds per gun per minute. Special ballast tanks were used to compensate for the loss of weight as ammunition was fired. Working and control of the guns required no less than 58 men. The fire control tower was in the middle of the conning tower and had a top section that could be raised 2 feet 0.61 m when in use. The upper control room was between the tower and the pressure hull. Just aft of the control room was the rangefinding room, with a 9 foot 2.7 m rangefinder on the bridge that could be raised 8 feet 2.4 m . Her six torpedo tubes came from a cancelled L class submarine and she was provided with one reload for each tube. It took some 24 minutes to reload them all because space in the torpedo room was restricted. The main engines were two 8 cylinder Admiralty diesel engines with a total output of 3,000 horsepower 2,200 kW . Two auxiliary 1,200 horsepower 890 kW MAN diesel engines taken from U 126 were installed for battery charging purposes. For underwater propulsion, two GEC electric motors of 1,000 horsepower 750 kW each were fitted. It was hoped to achieve over 8,000 horsepower 6,000 kW using both diesels and electric motors together, but the highest power achieved during a full power trial in March 1926 was 7,135 horsepower 5,321 kW . She had three groups of batteries, each with 110 cells weighing a total of 70 long tons 71 t . These batteries were also fitted with water filled cooling tubes, jackets, centrifugal pumps and finned heat exchangers the first recorded use of battery cooling to reduce core temperatures during aggressive charge and discharge cycles. In theory she could make 19.5 knots 36.1 km h on the surface, and at economical speed she had a greater range than normal cruisers, but both sets of diesel engines suffered from continual mechanical problems that reduced her speed and range. The X1's average diving time to periscope depth was 2 minutes 20 seconds. Her handling underwater was considered superior to other submarines of the period. After X1 was commissioned in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 she made a voyage to Gibraltar after which her main engine drive wheels were found to be damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea. Her starboard camshaft driveshaft broke during a full power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at Malta her port camshaft driveshaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good. Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS%20X1
"X2 often promoted as X2 X Men United and internationally as X Men 2 is a 2003 American superhero film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter, from a story by Singer, Hayter and Zak Penn. The film is based on the X Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to 2000's X Men, as well as the second installment in the X Men film series, and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, and Anna Paquin. Its plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, concerns the genocidal Colonel William Stryker Brian Cox leading an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant tracking computer Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them, forcing the X Men to team up with the Brotherhood of Mutants, their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race. Development on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released in 2000. David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Return to Weapon X and God Loves, Man Kills. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film. X2 was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 by 20th Century Fox, and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed 407 million worldwide, and received eight Saturn Awards nominations. A sequel, X Men The Last Stand, was released in 2006. At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attempts to assassinate the President of the United States but before he can do so, is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, Wolverine explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Wolverine returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who addresses him by name and seems to know about his past. The shape shifting Mystique gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X Jet is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake. Disguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind controlled Cyclops their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control. The X Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her presumably killing her. The X Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class. A Phoenix like shape rises from the flooded Alkali Lake. Additionally, Michael Reid McKay portrayed Jason Stryker Mutant 143, William Stryker's son who had the ability to create illusions. Cameo appearances include Katie Stuart as Kitty Pryde, a girl who can walk through walls Bryce Hodgson as Artie Kea Wong as Jubilee and Shauna Kain as Siryn, who is able to emit loud screams that alert the students to Stryker's attack. Also in the final scene with Xavier, a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket, as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue, played by Layke Anderson. These were confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey. Daniel Cudmore appeared as Peter Rasputin Colossus. Cudmore was set to use a Russian accent, but Singer dropped the idea for unknown reasons, and onset rewrites minimized the character's importance to a cameo. Jubilee, Psylocke and Multiple Man were to have cameos for the scene when Stryker and his troops storm the X Mansion. Beast, Gambit and Marrow were to have appearances during the Dark Cerebro sequence. Gambit's cameo was actually shot, but the footage was not used in the final cut. Beast's scene was to show Dr. Hank McCoy transforming into his notable blue fur while Marrow was to be seen lying on a ground in New York City. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, the film's writers, cameo in scenes of Wolverine's Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons. The financial and critical success of X Men persuaded 20th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel. Starting in November 2000, Bryan Singer researched various storylines one of them being the Legacy Virus of the X Men comic book series. Singer wanted to study, the human perspective, the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism, citing a need for a human villain . Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2 as the film series' The Empire Strikes Back, in that the characters are all split apart, and then dissected, and revelations occur that are significant... the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen. Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date, while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts. Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Singer and Hayter worked on another script, finishing in October 2001. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn's script in February 2002, turning down the opportunity to write Urban Legends Bloody Mary. Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts, but were deleted because there were too many characters. Dr. Hank McCoy can be seen on a television interview in one scene. Beast's appearance was to resemble Jim Lee's 1991 artwork of the character in the series X Men Legacy. Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker, transforming into Archangel. A reference to Dougherty's and Harris's efforts to include Angel remains in the form of an X ray on display in one of Stryker's labs. Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted. In Hayter's script, the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds, a character who appeared in God Loves, Man Kills as Stryker's personal assistant assassin. Singer changed her to Deathstrike, citing a need for another kick ass mutant . There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker. The scenes were shot, but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications. Hayter was disappointed, feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime. Rewrites were commissioned once more, specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time. This was because of her recent popularity in Monster's Ball, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, The control room was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can't connect. Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March 2002, but production did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty four sets were used in thirty eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers. John Ottman composed the score. Ottman established a new title theme, as well as themes specifically for Magneto, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Pyro. Singer and Sigel credited Road to Perdition as a visual influence. Though Sigel shot the first X Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They'll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate. Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments. The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet. John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film, but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X2, which was his first film as a production designer. For scenes involving Stryker's Alkali Base, Vancouver Film Studios, the largest sound stage in North America, was reserved. Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film, despite the fact it nearly received an Academy Award nomination. Up to 520 shots were created for X Men, while X2 commissioned roughly 800. A new computer program was created by Rhythm and Hues for the dogfight tornado scene. Cinesite was in charge of scenes concerning Cerebro, enlisting a 20 man crew. The Alkali Lake Dam miniature was 25 feet 7.6 m high and 28 feet 8.5 m wide. Cinesite created 300 visual effects shots, focusing on character animation, while Rhythm and Hues created over 100. The first cut of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent shots with Wolverine when Stryker's army storms the X Mansion. A few seconds were cut to secure a PG 13 rating. X2 opened in North America on May 2, 2003, accumulating 85,558,731 on its opening weekend in 3,749 theaters. The film grossed 214,949,694 in North America, earning 192,761,855 worldwide, for a total of 407,711,549. X2 was a financial success as it recouped its production budget three times. X2 debuted simultaneously in 93 countries, the largest North American and international opening ever at the time. In addition, the film was the sixth highest grossing film of 2003, also earning 107 million in its first five days of DVD release. X2 received positive reviews, with praise aimed at the acting, action, and story. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85 of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 244 reviews with an average score of 7.5 10. The website's consensus states Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2 X Men United is bigger and better than its predecessorand a benchmark for comic sequels in general. Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 68 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert was impressed by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film, but felt the storyline did not live up to its potential . In addition, Ebert wrote that the film's closing was perfect for a future installment, giving X2 three out of four stars. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor. Turan observed that the film carried emotional themes that are present in the world today and commented that the acting was better than usual . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance, concluding X2 is a summer firecracker. It's also a tribute to outcasts, teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks. Empire called X2 the best comic book movie of all time in 2006, while Wizard named the film's ending as the 22nd greatest cliffhanger of all time. In May 2007, Rotten Tomatoes listed X2 as the fifth greatest comic book film of all time. The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. In addition, Bryan Singer Direction , Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty Writing , and John Ottman Music all received nominations. It also received nominations for its costumes, makeup, special effects and DVD release, amounting to a total of eight nominations. The Political Film Society honored X2 in the categories of Human Rights and Peace, while the film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the storyline, special effects and action scenes. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal specifically referred to the film as fast paced, slow witted . Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest . Richard Corliss of Time argued that Singer depended too much on seriousness and that he did not have enough sensibilities to communicate to an audience. The film's score was composed by John Ottman, a regular collaborator with film director Bryan Singer. The soundtrack album X2 Original Motion Picture Score was released on April 29, 2003. Ottman used a sample of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem as the basis for the music in scenes featuring Nightcrawler. As well as the music on the album, tracks by Conjure One and 'N Sync also featured in the film. On July 19, 2012, La La Land Records issued an expanded version of Ottman's score, including the specially recorded version of Alfred Newman's Twentieth Century Fox fanfare incorporating Ottman's film theme.

"X Y stylized as X Y is the third studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple. It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code. The album contains twelve tracks and an additional hidden track, 'Til Kingdom Come . It is omitted from the track listing on the album sleeve, but listed as on the disc label and inside the album booklet. It was originally planned for American country star Johnny Cash to record it with lead singer Chris Martin, but Cash died before he was able to do so. The song Talk appeared in the track listing, although after it leaked online in early 2005 it was thought to have been downgraded to a B side for the album's subsequent single releases. X Y was released after a considerable amount of global anticipation. Overall reaction to the album was generally positive, though some critics cited it as being inferior to its predecessors. It was a significant commercial success, reaching the top spot of many charts worldwide, including the United Kingdom and United States, being the first time Coldplay topped the US chart. With accumulated sales of 8.3 million units in 2005 alone, X Y was the best selling music album released in 2005 worldwide. The album has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. The album spawned the singles Speed of Sound , Fix You , Talk , The Hardest Part , What If , and White Shadows . Coldplay announced details about X Y in March 2004 while the album was being recorded. Their initial plans were to stay out of the public eye throughout the year. Lead singer Chris Martin stated, We really feel that we have to be away for a while and we certainly won't release anything this year, because I think people are a bit sick of us. This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced but they were trying to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard . Prior to the announcement, Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland and British record producer Ken Nelson had started recording demos while in Chicago, Illinois. The band then entered a London studio in January 2004. The band spent all of 2004 producing X Y. The released album is the third version of which the band had produced during their late sessions, and some have even considered it as their fifth album due to constant changes in track lists and re recordings. The band members were not satisfied with the output of their initial sessions with Nelson, who had produced the band's previous two albums, Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head. The initial set release date was late 2004, but was later pushed back to January 2005. As the new target date was approaching, the band again discarded songs, which they deemed flat and passionless . Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions We realized that we didn't really have the right songs and some of them were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so we thought we better go back and record them again. Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves forward in every direction in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works. Attempting to perfect their work, Coldplay had to step it up a few notches and work hard at it to get it right . The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the production of X Y. When January went, the band had to finish the album they were conscious of the pressure as expectations for the record grew larger and completing it became tougher and tougher . Finally, the band was settled with the song Square One , which Martin has described as a call to arms and a plea to each of them not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else . Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks. Drummer Will Champion later admitted that Coldplay did not rush to complete the album because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also we wanted to make sure that it was the best it could possibly be . According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written about 14 or 15 songs . Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they ... kept finishing the record until it was way too late ... don't listen to it at the moment, because just find something to go back and change. The music of X Y consists of multi layered production with heavy electronic influences, featuring the extensive use of synthesizers. Musical characteristics that contribute to the album's multi layering and grandiosity include fast tempos, dynamic drum patterns, distorted guitar riffs, and driving bass lines. Coldplay has also cited various other influences in the album. The German electronic music pioneer Kraftwerk is evident on the song Talk , which borrows its synthesizer hook from 1981's Computer Love , with the riff instead being created by electric guitar. As mentioned before, also present is large electronic musical influences, from some of the likes of English musicians David Bowie and Brian Eno. Eno, who would later produce Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, also played backing synthesizer on the tracks Low and White Shadows The first single, Speed of Sound , also takes inspiration from the drumbeat of English singer songwriter Kate Bush's song Running Up that Hill . According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, who wrote a controversial article extensively criticizing the album, the band attempts to carry the beauty of 'Clocks' across the album, borrowing some of its features to songs like Speed of Sound . The opening track Square One also features the famous motif from Also sprach Zarathustra, known better as the title theme of Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science fiction film 2001 A Space Odyssey. The three note sequence is replicated in the song by distorted guitar riffs, with a backing synthesizer added for musical texture. The sequence also transitions as a part of the song's chorus, showcasing Chris Martin's trademark falsetto voice. Fix You features an organ and piano sound. The song starts with a hushed electric organ ballad, including Martin's falsetto. The song then builds with both an acoustic guitar and piano sound. The sound then shifts with a plaintive three note guitar line, ringing through a bringing rhythm upbeat tempo. Its instrumentation is varied with the sound of church style organs hovering throughout the background, piano notes, acoustic and electric guitar riffs, drums, bass guitar, and a singalong chorus. The Hardest Part features a faster piano ballad sound, and starts with a repeating two note piano riff, and features an instrumentation of a singsong guitar. It also includes a slow tempo with a drumming rhythm. The track ends with the band playing the repeated instrument riffs. Speed of Sound is a track musically based on the piano. The song benefits from an insistently ornate keyboard riff and a busy but less hummable chorus, in which the song builds into a huge drum beat and a synthesizer heavy chorus. The song also includes an upbeat tempo, with a driving bass line and distorted guitar riffs being heard throughout the song. Lyrically, X Y made an apparent shift from its predecessors, with many lyrics focused on a questioning and philosophical view of the world. On their previous works, Martin sang mostly in the first person I , but here moves to the second person you . Accordingly, the songs on the album are a reflection of Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves with lyrics that are earnest and vague . Another recurrent theme in the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include Fix You When you lose something you can't replace and also in X Y When something is broken, and you try to fix it, trying to repair it, any way you can and Talk Are you lost or incomplete Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece . This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover until you fix it using the Baudot Code . The artwork for X Y was designed by graphic design duo Tappin Gofton, formed by Mark Tappin and Simon Gofton Mark Tappin had previously worked for Coldplay on the Parachutes album cover and the covers of the singles therefrom. The image, which is visualized through a combination of colours and blocks, is a graphical representation of the Baudot code, an early form of telegraph communication using a series of ones and zeros to communicate. The code was developed by Frenchman Emile Baudot in the 1870s, and was a widely used method of terrestrial and telegraph communication. The alphabet of the code is presented in the liner notes of X Y. The track listing, included on the booklet, CD, and back of the album, uses X on tracks 1 to 6 and Y on tracks 7 to 12, rather than the conventional track numbering system. This is a reference to the title of the album. Many pages in the booklet include photos of the band working on the album. The final page of the booklet contains the slogan Make Trade Fair in the Baudot code, a reference to the name of the international organization which Chris Martin continues to support. The band dedicates the album to BWP that is presented also inside the liner notes it stands for Bruce W. Paltrow, the late father of Martin's wife at the time, Gwyneth Paltrow. All singles released from the album feature their titles in the same code on their respective covers. Martin sometimes wears coloured tape on his hands while on stage, as a reference to the album. X Y was initially intended for a 2004 release, although early news reported it would not be released until 2005 because of personal preferences, songs recorded in several sessions were scrapped and doing so had pushed the expected release date to January 2005. However, the new date went by and the band had to decide on another schedule. By early 2005 the album, rumoured to be called Zero Theory, had a target release date between March and May 2005. By early April the band had finalized the track listing of the album. Eventually, the album was released on 6 June 2005 in the United Kingdom via record label Parlophone. It was issued on 7 June in the United States by Capitol Records. The album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008, on two 180 gram vinyl records, as part of the From the Capitol Vaults series. Around three months prior to the album release, Coldplay began performing several songs from the album during live performances. The band made a headlining performance at public radio station KCRW FM's annual A Sounds Eclectic Evening, staging five songs from X Y and some of their old favourites. For the song The Scientist , Martin sang one of its verses backward, a technique he learned in shooting its music video. The album has four main singles that were released internationally Speed of Sound , Fix You , and Talk in 2005, and The Hardest Part in 2006. A fifth single, What If , was released in June 2006 to radio stations in France and the French speaking portions of Belgium and Switzerland. A commercial CD was also released in Belgium and features the same B side as The Hardest Part How You See the World recorded live at Earls Court , which was released in other European markets as well as Japan and Australia. This single features the Tom Lord Alge Mix of What If as the A side which differs from the usual album version. Finally, in June 2007, White Shadows was released as a radio only single in Mexico, to coincide with the band's 2007 Latin America Tour. This also complemented the special Tour Edition of the album that was released in these regions. The hidden track 'Til Kingdom Come is featured in The Shield season 5 premiere, a season 1 episode of Jericho, and in the superhero film The Amazing Spider Man 2012 . In addition, Chris Martin performed an acoustic rendition of the track at the funeral of former Attorney General of Delaware Beau Biden. X Y received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 33 reviews. Blender hailed it as Coldplay's masterpiece. NME described it as confident, bold, ambitious, bunged with singles and impossible to contain, and added that it reinforces Coldplay as the band of their time . Q magazine found it substantially more visceral and emotionally rewarding experience than both its predecessors. James Hunter of The Village Voice said that it is remarkably accomplished, fresh, and emotional . Uncut assertively called it an exceptional pop record . Spin magazine's Mikael Wood praised Coldplay for recasting their nerdy student Britpop as Important Rock Music without having to compromise Martin's unpretentious songwriting style. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it as a good record, crisp, professional, and assured, a sonically satisfying sequel to A Rush of Blood to the Head , stating it as impeccable and a strong, accomplished album . In a less enthusiastic review for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne felt that Coldplay's attempt at more grandiose music works only part of the time , even though he found their effort to mature commendable. Rhyannon Rodriguez from Kludge wrote that the album feels a little forced , describing the overall sounds as overtly weak . Alexis Petridis, writing in The Guardian, said that some of the songs are mostly beautifully turned , but marred by lyrics that are so devoid of personality that they sound less like song lyrics . Pitchfork's Joe Tangari called it bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable. Mojo wrote that the album is awash with cliches, non sequiturs, and cheap existentialism at times it all becomes nigh on unbearable . In a negative review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau named X Y dud of the month and called Coldplay a precise, bland, and banal band, giving the album a B grade. The band has received some criticism from some music critics for the similarities between the lead single, Speed of Sound , and Clocks , one of the band's most popular songs to date. Kelefa Sanneh of Rolling Stone magazine was less contented with X Y, writing it is something less exciting compared to A Rush of Blood to the Head that was a nervy bid for bigness . Sanneh notes that the album is the sound of a blown up band trying not to deflate and a surprising number of songs here just never take flight . Despite such, he compliments the album for featuring lovely ballads that sound, well, Coldplay ish . The album earned the band several awards. In 2006, it won the Best British Album accolade at the BRIT Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards which Coldplay shared with American hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas. X Y had scored Coldplay their third consecutive Mercury Prize nomination. It was also nominated for Best Rock Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, but lost to U2's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. X Y was voted the 32nd best album of the year in The Village Voice's annual Pazz Jop critics poll for 2005. On the other hand, X Y was voted the second most overrated album ever made in a 2005 BBC public poll. X Y was a commercial success in Europe. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Coldplay's third consecutive number one debut with sales totalling 464,471 the second largest opening sales week in UK history at the time. It is currently the fourth highest sales week behind Take That, Oasis and Adele. To date, the British Phonographic Industry BPI has certified the album nine times platinum. The album placed at number nine on the list of United Kingdom's 20 biggest selling albums of the 21st century, published by the British trade paper Music Week. As of October 2018, the album had sold over 2,790,000 copies in the UK, making it the second best selling Coldplay album behind A Rush of Blood to the Head. The American press have considered X Y a landmark achievement of Coldplay. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 737,000 copies despite the highly competitive retail week. The album gave the band their first US number one album by debut, and its initial sales surpassed the band's previous album releases Parachutes amassed over 6,500 copies in its debut and A Rush of Blood to the Head with sales of under 141,000. X Y marked the third highest first week sales in the United States for 2005, behind American rappers 50 Cent, whose second album, The Massacre, sold over one million units in its first week of release, and Kanye West, who sold over 860,000 copies with his album Late Registration. X Y also emerged as the biggest selling debut under rock genre. The Recording Industry Association of America RIAA has since certified the album three times platinum for accumulated shipments of over three million units. In Canada, the album debuted at 1 and sold 105,000 copies in its first week, making it the biggest selling debut of 2005 in Canada. It ended up being certified 5 Platinum in December 2008 for shipping of 500,000 copies. Altogether, the album emerged as 2005's best selling album worldwide, accumulating over 8.3 million units despite the aggregate three percent fall of sales. According to EMI, by the end of 2006 it sold 9.9 million copies. On the back cover, the tracklist is separated into two parts X and Y , with tracks 16 labeled as X1 through X6 and tracks 712 labeled Y1 through Y6 . All tracks are written by Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, and Chris Martin except where noted. To coincide with Coldplay's tour of Australia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, the album was re released in those territories as a Tour Edition , which also includes all the B side tracks and music videos of X Y's singles on a bonus DVD In addition a rare Japan Tour Special Edition Cat.

"Typhoon Xangsane, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Milenyo, was a typhoon that affected the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand during the 2006 Pacific typhoon season. The name Xangsane was submitted by Laos and means elephant. Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines, battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over Manila and emerging over the South China Sea, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least US 747 million in damage. The nucleus of Typhoon Xangsane originated from a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines. On September 23, a persistent area of convective thunderstorms was observed about 100 mi 160 km northwest of Palau, in an environment favorable to tropical cyclogenesis. The Japan Meteorological Agency JMA declared the formation of a tropical depression at 00 00 UTC on September 25. Simultaneously, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA began releasing warnings in relation to the tropical depression with the local name Milenyo. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC a joint United States Navy Air Force agency that monitors tropical cyclones globally issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert around the same time, designating the disturbance Tropical Depression 18W at 12 00 UTC. The system quickly organized as it drifted westward, and according to both the JMA and the JTWC, it attained tropical storm intensity near 00 00 UTC on September 26. Consequently, it received the international name Xangsane. The name was submitted by Laos and means elephant . The storm began to accelerate in forward speed and shift its direction toward the west northwest, attaining typhoon intensity at 18 00 UTC on September 26. At the time, it was centered about 390 mi 630 km east southeast of Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Over the next several hours, Xangsane rapidly intensified as it approached the archipelago the JMA estimates that the typhoon achieved its maximum 10 minute sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph early on September 27, with a corresponding central pressure of 940 millibars 28 inHg . According to the JTWC, the typhoon peaked with 1 minute winds of 230 km h 145 mph , corresponding to Category 4 strength on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale. The center of the powerful storm skirted the northern coast of Samar and continued west northwestward. With a well defined eye evident on visible satellite imagery, Xangsane struck southern Luzon around 12 00 UTC, and remained over the Philippines for the next day or so. Due to extensive interaction with land, the typhoon's structure deteriorated, and the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm early on September 28. Xangsane traveled over the Manila area before entering the South China Sea and turning due west, steered by the subtropical ridge to its north over mainland China. Over open waters, the system encountered conditions favorable to renewed intensification, including warm sea surface temperatures, light vertical wind shear, and strong upper level divergence. As a result, it reattained typhoon status by 18 00 UTC on September 28. Continued strengthening yielded a secondary peak on September 29, marked by 10 minute winds of 150 km h 90 mph , according to the JMA, and 1 minute winds of 215 km h 130 mph as ascertained by the JTWC. Tracking westward at around 17 km h 11 mph , Xangsane maintained its intensity until it neared Vietnam, when dry air and land interaction began to slowly diminish the typhoon on September 30. Just after 00 00 UTC on October 1, the system made landfall along the central coast of Vietnam, near Da Nang. At the time, Xangsane was a low end typhoon, with 10 minute winds of 130 km h 80 mph . The storm quickly declined in force as it progressed inland through Indochina it weakened to a severe tropical storm around 12 00 UTC, and to a tropical storm six hours later. Although the JTWC issued its final warning on Xangsane just after landfall, the agency continued to track the storm until 00 00 on October 2. At the same time, the JMA downgraded Xangsane to a tropical depression it dissipated later that day, over Thailand. On September 27, PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3, a warning for winds of 100185 km h 62115 mph , for areas of southern Luzon. Storm Signal Number 2, for winds of 60100 km h 3762 mph , was raised for northern Samar Island and central Luzon. Storm Signal Number 1 3060 km h, 2037 mph was issued for northwestern Luzon, including Metro Manila, and northern Visayas, including the rest of Samar Island. Schools in the warned area were suspended, and airports and seaports were closed. Philippine Airlines cancelled over half of its flights to and from Ninoy Aquino International Airport for September 28, and various transit services also suspended service. Metro Manila and the Tagalog provinces were warned of possible flooding and strong winds. When it became clear that Xangsane would approach the Capital, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day. Prior to Xangsane's final landfall, the Vietnamese government set up a steering committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam. Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300,000 people from low lying areas along the coast from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen, as well as hilly areas prone to landslides. The Vietnamese government also ordered about 2,400 boats, including 273 fishing boats, to return to port. Vietnam Airlines, the national airline, cancelled or diverted all flights on September 30 and October 1. These efforts were carried out in order to prevent a repeat of the damage and fatalities caused by Typhoon Chanchu earlier in the season. Although Xangsane had weakened considerably over land, residents of northern Thailand were advised of the threat of flooding from the remnant low of Xangsane as it approached. The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation alerted its provincial offices throughout the country to be prepared for strong winds, flash flooding, and landslides. Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible mudslides, and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations. Damage was widespread in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In some parts of the country, electricity was cut off for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island wide power outage. Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400 people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago. The Philippine government estimated that approximately 2 million people in 19 provinces were affected by Xangsane, which destroyed many homes and farms on its path through the islands. The local and regional Philippine National Red Cross chapters reported major damage in at least 116 municipalities, 12 cities, and a total of 1,295 barangays across the country. Torrential rains from Milenyo also caused flooding and landslides in Laguna, Cavite, and Quezon. Xangsane caused the destruction of the Calumpang Dam in the Municipality of Liliw, which channeled water to irrigation canals around the area. In all, Milenyo was responsible for 197 deaths and 5.9 billion Philippine pesos 118 million, 2006 USD in damage, mostly to personal property and agriculture. Xangsane made its second and final landfall in central Vietnam, causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese ong 629 million, 2006 USD in damage and killed 71 people. The worst structural damage occurred in the city of Da Nang, where 26 people were killed. The provinces of Quang Nam and Nghe An were also hard hit, with a total of 25 people killed. The storm damaged or destroyed around 320,000 homes, downed thousands of trees and power lines, and flooded major streets. Significant agricultural damage was reported, especially in Quang Binh Province. More than 3,000 square kilometres 1,200 sq mi of crops, mostly rice, were damaged or washed away by the floodwaters. There were also reports of heavy losses of poultry and livestock, and nearly 13 km2 5 sq mi of aquaculture and 786 fishing boats were lost. The remnants of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture over the north central part of the country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3 million rai 2,100 km2, 520,000 acres of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters 10 ft , and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60 cm 2 ft . The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from stagnant waters. Following the passage of Xangsane, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies IFRC issued an emergency request for 5.7 million Swiss francs 4.6 million, 2006 USD to aid the Philippine Red Cross in its relief effort. In addition, the movement dispatched 3,000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions, damage assessments, and assistance to people affected by the typhoon. The Philippine Red Cross provided canned goods, rice, clothing, and personal hygiene items to over 6,300 families, and local volunteers provided assistance to people in shelters. The Spanish Red Cross, present since 1998 as a backup to the Philippine Red Cross, also sent officials, logistics equipment, and water purification systems to the more heavily areas to aid in disaster relief and damage assessments. In Manila, fallen billboards killed several people and caused traffic delays along EDSA, the main highway of the metropolis. This prompted some members of the Senate of the Philippines to push for the removal and banning of billboard advertising in the Manila area, which had been an issue for some time. Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago wrote an appeal to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, asking her to approve the Anti Billboard Blight Act of 2006 , which would ban billboard advertising on major thoroughfares within Metro Manila. On October 3, the IFRC released 100,000 Swiss francs 80,300, 2006 USD from its disaster relief fund to support the Red Cross of Vietnam, and issued an emergency appeal for 1 million Swiss francs 810,000, 2006 USD in aid the next day. The Vietnamese government also released 100 billion Vietnamese ong 6.2 million, 2006 USD and 1,500 metric tons 1,650 short tons of rice from the national food security stock to help the recovery effort in central Vietnam. The National Fatherland Front also issued an appeal to national and international organizations for donations and aid. On October 13, a minivan carrying a relief team from a local government in Ho Chi Minh city was caught in an accident, killing 12 aid workers. The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation and the Thai Red Cross Society evacuated residents from areas of central Thailand that had been affected by flooding from the remnants of Xangsane. The Red Cross also provided victims and evacuees with food and emergency kits, and several Red Cross health centers in 12 provinces issued emergency relief kits, drinking water, and medicine kits to at least 16,000 families in flood stricken areas. As a result of the deaths and damage caused, it was decided at the 39th annual meeting of the ESCAP WMO Typhoon Committee in Manila in December 2006 that the name Xangsane, along with four others, would be retired from the name list. Its PAGASA name, Milenyo, was also retired by PAGASA. In December 2007, the committee selected the name Leepi to replace Xangsane on the Western Pacific basin name lists beginning in 2008. In 2010 the name selected by PAGASA to replace Milenyo was Mario, but the name itself was retired and was replaced with Maymay after devastating Metro Manila and Northern Luzon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon%20Xangsane
"Severe Tropical Cyclone Xavier RSMC Nadi Designation 01F, JTWC Designation 01P was a strong pre season cyclone that formed on October 20, 2006 to the north of the Santa Cruz Islands. Cyclone Xavier was also the strongest storm of the season. During the next day it rapidly developed and was designated as Tropical Depression 01F later that day, before being designated as Tropical Cyclone Xavier while over Santa Cruz early on October 22. Later on October 22, Xavier intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, before passing over Tikopia early the next day. Xavier then reached its peak wind speeds of 175 km h 110 mph 10 min , which made it a Category 4 cyclone early on October 24. Xavier stayed at its peak wind speeds until early the next day when it started to rapidly weaken, becoming a depression early on October 26. The remnants of Xavier persisted until October 28 before dissipating. There were no casualties reported as a result of the storm and little impact reported in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the north of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia. The systems rapid intensification subsequently slowed down during October 23, as an upper level anticyclone located to the northwest of the system impeded the systems outflow. The system also started to move south eastwards during that day, as a trough of low pressure created a break in the ridge of high pressure that was steering Xavier. The FMS subsequently estimated during October 24, that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute sustained wind speeds of 175 km h 110 mph , while it was located about 220 km 135 mi to the east of Vanua Lava in northern Vanuatu. The JTWC also estimated during October 24, that the system had peaked with 1 minute sustained wind speeds of 215 km h 135 mph , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson hurricane wind scale. Over the next day the system maintained its peak intensity as it moved south eastwards, before it turned westwards during the next day towards Vanuatu and rapidly weakened after it moved into an area of cooler sea surface temperatures and strong vertical wind shear. As a result, during October 26, The FMS and JTWC both reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on the system as they expected it to dissipate within 12 hours. Xavier's remnants were last noted by the FMS during October 28, after the systems low level circulation centre was not able to be distinguished. Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane started to issue special advisories to support the meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning. The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu were maintained until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them. There were no casualties as a result of Xavier. In the Solomon Islands, communications to the Temotu province were lost. When communications were restored on October 24, it was reported that there was only minor tree damage on the islands of Utupua and Vanikolo. On Tikopia, crops sustained damage, though the effects were considered light given the circumstances. Strong and gusty winds, rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern Vanuatuan islands, however, no significant damage was reported within the islands.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone%20Xavier%20%282006%29
"The Xbox One is an eighth generation home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox Family. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013, and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an all in one entertainment system , hence the name 'Xbox One'. The Xbox One mainly competes against Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch. Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit APU built around the x86 64 instruction set. Xbox One's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D pad, and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking features, and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay, or live stream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games can also be played off console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices. The console can play Blu ray Disc, and overlay live television programming from an existing set top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the Kinect 2.0 , providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition. The Xbox One received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor on launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post launch received positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands. The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the Xbox One S in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for HDR10 high dynamic range video, as well as support for 4K video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high end model, named Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November it features upgraded hardware specifications, and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. The Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360, Microsoft's previous video game console, which was introduced in 2005 as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. Over the years, the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the unit's size and improve its reliability. In 2010, Microsoft's Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about halfway through its lifecycle this was aided by the introduction of the Kinect motion sensor that year, which Lewis stated would extend the lifecycle by five years. Initial hardware for the 360's successor, commonly referred to by the industry as the Xbox 720 , was reportedly under development as early as May 2011. The official developer kit was codenamed Durango, and appeared to be available to developers by mid 2012. Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor, cloud access to games and media, integration with phone and tablet devices, and technology to provide players heads up displays on glasses worn by the player, codenamed Fortaleza Microsoft did not comment on these reported features. Leaked design documents also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games, though Microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing the design and were thinking about what is next and how we can push the boundaries of technology like we did with Kinect , but did not comment on the validity of the information. Prior to the official unveiling, rumors had circulated that the next Xbox console would be an always on system requiring a persistent Internet connection, though Microsoft had not confirmed this. This had drawn some concerns from consumers, which were heightened when Microsoft Studios Adam Orth stated in a Twitter message in April 2013 that said Sorry, I don't get the drama around having an 'always on' console...Every device now is 'always on.' That's the world we live in. dealwithit . Orth's message drew further ire towards Microsoft, with concerns about digital rights management and practices against the sale of used games with an always on unit. Orth opted to leave Microsoft few a days later due to the backlash, and subsequently went to work for the studio Three One Zero for their first game Adrift. Despite Microsoft's statements following this situation, denying the rumors, the mood it created lingered over the next several months. The new console was publicly unveiled under the name Xbox One on May 21, 2013 in a press conference designed to cover the unit's broad multimedia and social capabilities. However, this event focused heavily on the multimedia capabilities, demonstrating integration with television over the first 30 minutes before video game capabilities were brought up. Not only had this approach confused consumers about the intent of the Xbox One, but also Microsoft employees who had been working on the console. Phil Spencer stated that several employees complained to him that they felt this presentation had blow up all the good work that 've done by talking about the product in a way that's not really matching what the soul of an Xbox console is about and what customers are looking for from . Because of the negative feedback from the May presentation, the press event for the E3 2013 was made to showcase the video game functionality of the Xbox One first and foremost Don Mattrick described the event as all about the games . At that time, Microsoft announced that the console would be released in 21 different markets on November 22, 2013, but this was later amended down to 13. The change, which pushed the release date for the other eight markets to 2014, was attributed to unforeseen complexity in localizing the device's voice recognition capabilities. Later, in September 2014, the Xbox One was released in 26 markets, including remaining markets in Europe, the Japanese market, and Middle Eastern markets. Microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for Xbox One than what was used upon its release all games, including those purchased at retail, would be bound to the user's Xbox Live account. Users could access their purchased games from any other Xbox One console, play games without their disc once installed, and allow users to share their games with up to ten designated family members. Users would trade games at participating retailers , and could also transfer a game directly to any Xbox Live friend on their list for at least 30 days, but only once. To synchronize licenses, the console would be required to connect to the internet once every 24 hours if the console could not connect, all games would be disabled until the console was connected again. Reaction to this digital rights management scheme was extremely negative in light of the previous concerns about the always on console from earlier in the year. Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers' first sale rights for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on second hand copies of games. GameSpot editor Tom Mcshea went on to say that Microsoft had become anti consumerist, trying to punish their loyal customers with strict restrictions, and that by saying no to the used game restrictions and always online that Microsoft is so happily implementing on the Xbox One, Sony has elevated the PlayStation 4 as the console to grab this holiday season. Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind, but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media. He also noted that Microsoft was not giving in to publishers' objections to used games, but rather trying to balance the needs of consumers and the industry, and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time. On June 19, 2013, shortly after E3 2013, Microsoft announced in response to the negative reaction that it would change its policy Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model and reverse course. As with Xbox 360, users would be able to share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in response to the negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One. Microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for the Kinect sensor to be plugged into Xbox One at all times for it to function. Privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data could be used for targeted advertising, and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users. In response to these claims, Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users, that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy, and that the console would not redistribute user generated content without permission. In response to these pre launch changes and a belief that Microsoft's decisions for the systems were in poor judgement, journalists and consumers jokingly gave Xbox One nicknames such as Xbox 180 , in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft's decision to reverse its controversial decisions, and Xbone , suggesting that the company was throwing a bone to consumers by making these changes. In 2015, four members of an international hacking group pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to Microsoft's computer network and obtaining sensitive information relating to Xbox One and Xbox Live. At the time of the security breach, Microsoft was in the development stage for its next generation gaming system. Between 2011 and 2013, the hackers spent hundreds of hours searching through Microsoft's network copying log in credentials, source code, technical specifications and other data. Group members say they were driven by an immense curiosity about Microsoft's then unreleased Xbox One console and associated software. Using stolen access credentials , two of the hackers also committed a physical theft by entering a secure building on Microsoft's Redmond Washington campus and carrying away three Durango development kits. On June 13, 2016, during its E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One S, a revision of the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Microsoft also teased a high end version of Xbox One with upgraded hardware codenamed Project Scorpio , which was unveiled and released the following year as Xbox One X. On April 16, 2019, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One S All Digital Edition, which will include three digital games, Forza Horizon 3, Sea of Thieves and Minecraft. The console does not have a physical disc drive, and all games must be downloaded. It is 50 cheaper than the Xbox One S at 249, and was made available on May 7, 2019. The original Xbox One's exterior casing consists of a two tone liquid black finish with half finished in a matte grey, and the other in a glossier black. The matte side of the top of the console consists of a large air vent. The design was intended to evoke a more entertainment oriented and simplified look than previous iterations of the console among other changes, the LED rings used by Xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white Xbox logo used to communicate the system's status to the user. Due to the overall ventilation design of the console, the original Xbox One is designed to only sit horizontally. Xbox One S utilizes a refreshed version of this design, with a case that is 40 smaller in size, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The main Xbox One S SKU is colored in an entirely matte Robot White finish, with half of the console adorned with machined holes, and a visible circular vent on top of the console's right half. It utilizes push button controls rather than capacitive keys, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved to the front of the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally plugging directly into the wall . The Xbox One is powered by an AMD Jaguar Accelerated Processing Unit APU with two quad core modules totaling eight x86 64 cores clocked at 1.75 GHz, and 8 GB of DDR3 RAM with a memory bandwidth of 68.3 GB s. The memory subsystem also features an additional 32 MB of embedded static RAM, or ESRAM, with a memory bandwidth of 109 GB s. For simultaneous read and write operations, the ESRAM is capable of a theoretical memory bandwidth of 192 GB s and a memory bandwidth of 133 GB s has been achieved with operations that involved alpha transparency blending. The system includes a non replaceable hard drive and a Blu ray Disc optical drive. 138 GB of hard drive space is used by the operating system, with the remainder available for the storage of games. Since the June 2014 software update, up to two USB drives can be connected to Xbox One to expand its capacity. External drives must support USB 3.0 and have a capacity of at least 256 GB. It was reported that 3 GB of RAM would be reserved for the operating system and utility software, leaving 5 GB for games. With DirectX 11.2 as the console's API, the graphics processing unit GPU is based on an AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, which have a total of 768 cores, running at 853 MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.31 TFLOPS. For networking, Xbox One supports Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11n wireless, and Wi Fi Direct. Greg Williams, GM of Xbox silicon development The original Xbox One supports 1080p and 720p video output unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One does not support 1080i and other interlaced resolutions. Xbox One supports HDMI 1.4 for both input and output, and does not support composite or component video. Xbox One supports 7.1 surround sound, Dolby Atmos, and DTS X. Xbox One S additionally supports 2160p 4K resolution video output, and high dynamic range HDR color using HDR10 with a future update to add Dolby Vision HDR support for streaming video . 4K video can be played from supported streaming services and Ultra HD Blu ray Disc, Games are upscaled from 1080p resolution, and are not rendered at 4K. The GPU on Xbox One S has a higher clock speed and ESRAM bandwidth than the original model, which can provide some performance improvements on games with dynamic resolution scaling or uncapped frame rates. The console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures can be taken, including forcing the hardware to run in a lower power statea feature that was not present on Xbox 360. Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance, but the setting would be intended as a last resort to prevent permanent hardware damage. The Xbox One's controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360's controller, but with various refinements to its form. Among its changes include a smoother form, textured analog sticks, a four way directional pad, and redesigned triggers and shoulder buttons with a curved shape for ergonomics. Menu and View buttons have replaced the Start and Back buttons. Each trigger features independent rumble motors called Impulse Triggers , which allows developers to program directional vibration. One trigger can be made to vibrate when firing a gun, or both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit. The controller also contains light emitters that allow it to be tracked and paired using the Kinect sensor, and to detect when it's not being held to automatically enter a low power state. An updated revision of the controller was released in June 2015, which includes a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and other minor changes. A third revision was introduced alongside and first bundled with Xbox One S, with textured grips and Bluetooth support. The Xbox One controller includes a micro USB port when attached via a micro USB cable, the controller can operate without battery power and can charge remotely, and is supported on computers running Windows 7 or later with drivers. The Xbox One Wireless Adapter accessory allows wireless use of Xbox One controllers on Windows computers also running Windows 7 or later. The Elite Wireless Controller was released in October 2015. It was described and marketed as an elite controller for the elite gamer , containing interchangeable parts, hair trigger locks for the triggers that allow users to reduce the amount of distance they must be pressed to register a press, and software for remapping buttons. In May 2018, Microsoft announced the Xbox Adaptive Controllera special controller designed for users with disabilities. It features two large dome like buttons, and a series of connectors corresponding to standard Xbox controller buttonswhich are used to attach specific types of buttons and other assertive peripherals. The controller can also be used in conjunction with Copilota feature introduced in 2017 that allows multiple controllers to be used in tandem on behalf of a single player. As of the November 2018 update, developers may now optionally allow their titles to support computer mice and keyboards as input. Microsoft also unveiled an exclusive partnership with Razer Inc. to produce a specific line of Xbox optimized keyboard and mice peripherals, with Xbox system keys and support for Razer's Chroma LED lighting platform. The Kinect 2.0, an updated natural user interface sensor, was redesigned and recreated to provide motion tracking and voice commands for the Xbox One. Kinect 2.0 features a wide angle time of flight camera and a 1080p camera, in comparison to the VGA resolution of the Xbox 360 version, and processes 2GB of data per second to map its environment. Kinect 2.0 has an improved accuracy over its predecessor it can track up to 6 people simultaneously, referred to as skeletons , perform heart rate tracking, track controller gestures, and read QR codes to redeem Xbox Live gift cards. By default, voice recognition is active at all times, so the console can receive voice commands from the user, even when the console is in sleep mode. It is possible to wake the console with a command, although settings are available to change which individual Kinect functions are active. Prior to and after the mandate, all Xbox One consoles initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included. On June 9, 2014, cheaper Xbox One bundles were introduced, which did not include the Kinect sensor. Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox One bundles without Kinect was to a choice to people that would allow people to buy an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to , while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect. An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games, allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10 of the GPU processing power. These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking, regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use. A Windows compatible Kinect 2.0 was released on July 15, 2014. Kinect 2.0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014 it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight. Xbox One S lacks the Kinect connection port, requiring a USB power adapter to use the accessory. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online up until March 2017. The adapter was sold separately thereafter, but has since been discontinued. Kinect for Xbox One was officially discontinued on October 25, 2017. The Xbox One runs two operating systems within a hypervisor games run within one separate operating system, while apps and the user interface run within a stripped down version of Microsoft Windows the original system software was based on Windows 8, but it has since been changed to Windows 10. This architecture allows resources to be allocated specifically to different aspects of the console's functions, including multitasking and Kinect processing, ensuring an absolute guarantee of performance for games. Xbox One supports Universal Windows Platform apps, which can be designed to run across Xbox One, Windows 10, and Windows 10 Mobile in synchronization with the Windows platform. Xbox One's user interface uses Microsoft's Fluent Design System previous iterations of the console's software used the Metro design language. The dashboard is divided into Home , Mixer , Community , Entertainment , and Store sections, with the Home page further divided into blocks that can display pinned games apps, as well as other content. Pressing the Xbox Guide button opens a sidebar with access to common functions such as the friends list, apps, the user's party, and settings. Users can go back to the dashboard while using games or apps using either the Xbox button on their controller or a voice command up to four apps can run either actively or in the background at once, but only one game can run at a time. Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands. Xbox One's voice control capabilities are similar to, albeit richer than those of Xbox 360. The voice assistant Cortana was added in 2016 to provide expanded voice command functionality with natural language recognition. The dashboard originally used a layout similar to Windows 8's Start screen , with a horizontal scrolling, tile based interface. This design was replaced for Xbox Preview Program members in September 2015 with the current interface, known as the New Xbox One Experience , which was publicly released as part of the November 12, 2015 system update. Alongside its new layout, support for Kinect motion controls on the dashboard were removed. The UI was refreshed again in April 2017, adding the new Guide sidebar and other new features. At this time, the ability to snap apps as a sidebar for multi tasking was removed. The UI was further revamped in October 2017 to use elements of Windows 10's forthcoming design language, and adds a new, lighter color scheme option for the console's user interface. The Xbox One can view and play content from DLNA servers and USB storage devices using the Media Player app. An application allows playback of video from Blu ray Disc, DVD and CD media. The console provides the ability to feed live television by serving as an HDMI pass through for an existing television provider's set top box or an optional Digital TV Tuner accessory that allows use of digital terrestrial television. The console provides its own electronic program guide known as OneGuide, augmenting the existing streaming functionality to provide show recommendations based on viewing history, integrated access to App Channels corresponding to online video services, and voice control via Kinect. The set top box and television are controlled by OneGuide using an IR blaster. The Xbox One does not provide full DVR functionality for recording television programs executive Yusuf Mehdi indicated that the console would work in tandem with existing television services, but that Microsoft would need to work with them directly to provide extended functionality, such as DVR integration. The digital TV tuner accessory allows limited DVR functionality for pausing and rewinding live TV for up to 30 minutes. In June 2016, Microsoft announced that their plans for full DVR functionality for the Xbox One were on hold. The Xbox Live service has been scaled up to use 300,000 servers for Xbox One users. Cloud storage is available to save music, films, games and saved content, and developers are able to use Live servers along with the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform to offer dynamic in game content and other functionality. Users can have up to 1,000 friends. The December 2016 software update added the new social networking feature Clubs, which allows users to join groups focused on specific interests or games, and Looking for group LFG , a system to help users locate players to join their party for multiplayer play. Players can use the Upload Studio app to edit and share clips from the last five minutes of gameplay footage that is automatically recorded by the console. Games can also be developed so that recording can automatically be triggered in response to notable events, such as achievements. Xbox One supports streaming directly to the services Mixer and Twitch. Users can use voice commands to immediately begin streaming footage of their current game directly to the service, and use Kinect's camera and microphone to record video and audio narration. Users can feature recorded clips on their Xbox Live profile page in a Showcase section. As with Xbox 360, premium online features such as multiplayer, voice communication, broadcasting and Upload Studio require an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use. Unlike Xbox 360, a user's Xbox Live Gold subscription benefits apply to all other users of their designated home console as well, rather than requiring a separate subscription for each user. Since June 2014, applications no longer require an Xbox Live Gold membership to use. Additional subscriptions for outside services such as Netflix may still be required. Microsoft also extended its Games with Gold program to Xbox One, providing free Xbox 360 and Xbox One games to Xbox Live Gold subscribers on a monthly basis. The Xbox SmartGlass app provides extended functionality on Xbox One, allowing devices running Windows Phone, Windows 8, iOS and Android to be used as a companion device for Xbox One features, such as powering on the console, a remote control, accessing messages and the Activity Feed, purchasing content, and providing integration with certain games and content. The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live television to Android and Windows devices if the console is using a USB digital television tuner. On Windows 10, SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox App, which supports the local streaming of games from Xbox One to personal computers and tablets running Windows 10. An Xbox One controller must be used, but Windows compatible headsets and microphones can be used for voice chat. Games requiring Kinect are not supported, while Game DVR and online streaming are not available while using this functionality. Per a partnership with Oculus VR, users will also be able to stream Xbox One games to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset by means of Xbox app for Windows 10 as of 2015 there were no immediate plans for direct integration between Xbox One and Oculus Rift. Xbox One games are distributed physically on Blu ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Microsoft Store formerly Xbox Games Store . All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage one can begin to play portions of a game such as opening levels once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while the remainder of the game is downloaded or installed in the background. However, for older titles such as Xbox 360 games, see Xbox 360 compatibility , below , one must wait until installation is completed to play. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server side processing. Microsoft introduced an Early access program known as Xbox Game Preview in 2015, which allows developers to launch unfinished games for consumers to purchase and beta test before its official launch. Since June 2017, games may be promoted with additional icons that denote compatibility with hardware enhancements found in newer Xbox One models, including support for high dynamic range HDR colors on Xbox One S and Xbox One X , native rendering at 4K resolution Xbox One X , and specific optimizations for Xbox One X. In February 2017, Microsoft introduced a subscription on demand service known as Xbox Game Pass, separate from Xbox Live Gold, which allows users to download and play games from its library at no additional charge for the life of the subscription. In April 2019, Microsoft also introduced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which bundles Game Pass with an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Larry Hryb, Xbox Live Director of programming At its launch, the Xbox One did not have native backward compatibility with original Xbox or Xbox 360 games. It had been a desired launch feature by Microsoft and had been actively under development as early as 2007 under the Trioxide program as to get Xbox 360 code to run on 64 bit hardware. Rather than going the route of the initial PlayStation 3 which included a core PlayStation 2 system on a chip processor, the Xbox One hardware was designed to include support for Xbox 360 XMA and texture processing on hardware, knowing this would be difficult to replicate in software. Following criticism of its plan for an always on console from the May 2013 announcement, Microsoft had to put significant effort to prepare the Xbox One software for a revised approach, and the backwards compatibility development work were put on hold. Interim solutions were suggested senior project management and planning director Albert Penello explained that Microsoft was initially considering a cloud gaming platform to enable backward compatibility, but he felt it would be problematic due to varying internet connection qualities. Xbox Live director of programming Larry Major Nelson Hryb did state that users could theoretically use the HDMI in port on the console to pass an Xbox 360 or, alternatively, any other device that supports HDMI output, including competing consoles through Xbox One. This process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable display lag. Following the release of the Xbox One and transition of Phil Spencer to the head of the Xbox division in 2014, he and software engineering vice president Kareem Choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company. Choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on Trioxide, including Kevin La Chapelle, Jonathan Morrison, and Barry Bond, to restart the program. The team chose to start with Castle Crashers, which included Xbox networking features, to test backwards compatibility. Castle Crashers frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes, which La Chapelle was able to obtain from the game's developers, The Behemoth, which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix the compatibility issues. Solving most of the major problems through Castle Crashers, the background compatibility team decided to let the program be announced at E3 2015 with plans to have one hundred titles available by the end of 2015. However, by E3, they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates. During the event, Morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One was its scheduling rate, and when they returned, Morrison's idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by the end of that year. Individual games still brought some difficulty, specifically Halo Reach, but this prompted the team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where Xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run as is on the Xbox One and how to work around those this further set up the potential to improve Xbox 360 games on the future iterations of the Xbox One, such as the Xbox One X to improve graphics support. Xbox 360 backward compatibility uses Fission , a software emulator within the system software 104 Xbox 360 titles were supported at the feature's public launch, with more added in the following months. Xbox 360 games contained within Rare Replay are packaged as standalone applications using the Xbox 360 emulation. Microsoft stated that publishers would only need to provide permission to the company to allow the repackaging, and it expected the number of supported games to increase significantly over time. Microsoft, along with fourteen other third party publishers, will offer supported games, and all Games with Gold titles on Xbox 360 since November 2015 are made compatible. On June 10, 2019, Microsoft stated that it had wound down the addition of new titles to the backwards compatibility program in order to focus on Xbox One's successor. Xbox division head Phil Spencer had also hinted the possibility of adding support for games from the original Xbox. For the backwards compatibility team, after they completed the framework for Xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over, they turned to the question of compatibility with the original Xbox console. The program was started in November 2016, under the code name Fusion , and was led by software engineer Spencer Perreault. Perreault initially tried the same approaches as the team had done with Fission , but due to the differences in memory management sizes and chipset bit rates, these initial tests failed. Instead, Perreault worked to bring Dolphin , a developer tool for the original Xbox, working to get its emulation correct. La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10 hit rate on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90 . As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed console System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox. With Perreault's success, Microsoft announced the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017. Thirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017. Microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to the Xbox One service during April 2018. Microsoft does not anticipate that there will be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property, contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct. While the initial unveiling of the Xbox One in May 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use, other features of the console were highlighted by journalists. The editorial staff of Game Informer offered both praise and criticism for the console. Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsoft's intent to control the living room . He called Xbox One's instant switching features impressive , and that the console was a step in the right direction with regards to TV entertainment, especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of non intuitive user interfaces often found on cable set top boxes. Jeff Cork said that Microsoft had some great ideas for the console, but that it failed to properly communicate them. Microsoft's E3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that, beyond increased graphical capabilities, provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous generation gamesgiving little incentive for buying the new console. Rafi Mohammed, author of The Art of Pricing , felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One too high and that the 100 premium over its competitor could derail the system during the 2013 holiday season. Upon its release, the Xbox One received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers. In its launch review, Polygon gave the Xbox One an 8 10. Its design was described as inoffensive but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and premium design, but some members of the site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews noting that it carried over Windows 8's design language, the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more robust voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a learning curve in understanding what works and what doesn't. Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set top boxes drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs , Polygon felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience feels like a major step forward in set top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one. Ben Gilbert of Engadget was similarly modest upon its launch, assigning the console a score of 81 100 and describing the Xbox One's design as a 1993 artist's rendering of 2013's technology . Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the ubiquit Xbox 360 design, he praised the controller for its improved D pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons. Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst magical , every false positive or unrecognized command had us reaching for the controller. The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4, but its game library view was described as being a jumbled, sadly unfilterable rows of every owned piece of software , that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not. The console was also panned for missing certain promised features on launch, such as Upload Studio, game streaming, and certain apps services. Later on, critics felt that the Xbox One's functionality had matured over the year following its launch Jeff Bakalar of CNET, assigning it a score of 8 10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it. There are oddities peppered throughout, which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations. Xbox One's in game performance was mixed, with some titles showing slower performance over PS4, but some multi platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4. CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4, not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage, support for high speed USB 3.0 as secondary storage, and having a slightly better lineup of upcoming exclusives, concluding that While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch, that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One's original missteps. Nick Pino of TechRadar, giving it four stars out of five, similarly felt that the Xbox One more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago, citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that there's still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery. However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface. Alaina Yee of IGN also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch, assigning it with Kinect a score of 8.1 10 and acknowledging that Microsoft had made good on its promise of listening to consumers, rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers. Regarding the console's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4, it was noted that while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally won't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game when there is one unless they see both running side by side , and examples of gorgeous Xbox One games were noted, such as Sunset Overdrive and Forza Motorsport 5. The number of hidden options in Xbox One's user interface was equated to hunting for treasure in a messy room as such, Kinect voice commands, in combination with access to common functions within the Xbox SmartGlass app, were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience. The Xbox One S revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model, including its streamlined design, the addition of HDR and 4K video support, and visual improvements on some games such as Fallout 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider when upscaled to 4K. However, TechRadar noted regressions such as the lack of a Kinect port considered one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago , and concerns that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to fragmentation of Xbox One's ecosystem, as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way. Dieter Bohn of The Verge similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4K Blu ray players on the market, consumers were more interested in streaming 4K content which could be accomplished with cheaper digital media players than 4K Blu ray discs, and noted the small number of HDR enabled games on launch. Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners consider Xbox One X instead. The Xbox One platform has faced criticism for lacking in exclusive releases over competitors such as PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Although there have been releases in flagship Microsoft franchises such as Forza and Halo, they have underperformed in comparison to other entries, while several major Xbox One exclusives have faced notable delays, such as Crackdown 3, or outright cancellations, including Fable Legends and Scalebound. By contrast, PS4 and Switch have seen a large number of critically successful first and third party exclusives, and Activision would sign with Sony Interactive Entertainment for timed exclusivity on certain add on content in the Call of Duty and Destiny franchisesthe former having replaced a previous deal with Microsoft. An analyst also noted that Microsoft's first party studios were not as strong as those of Sony, explaining that Sony has always been about first party and Microsoft wanted to emulate that, but they allowed studios like Rare and Lionhead to fade away. In 2018, Microsoft acquired a large number of third party studios, including Compulsion Games, InXile Entertainment, Ninja Theory, Obsidian Entertainment, Playground Games, and Undead Labs, and hired former Crystal Dynamics head Darrell Gallagher to lead a new Microsoft studio known as The Initiative. In 2016, Microsoft began to make future Xbox One exclusive first party releases simultaneously available on Windows 10 PCs, with digital cross buy support via Microsoft Store under the branding Xbox Play Anywhere. This, thus, makes the games Microsoft platform exclusives rather than Xbox One exclusives. Microsoft has used the branding console launch exclusive to refer to titles such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds that are timed or permanent exclusives to Xbox console hardware, but were already available on, or are planned to be available on PC. Microsoft initially imposed policies referred to as the parity clause on indie games, which required that the Xbox One version of a game be released at the same time as versions on other platforms. Phil Spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that Xbox One was a first class platform by discouraging staggered releases. However, these policies resulted in some studios, such as Vlambeer developer of Nuclear Throne choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with Sony instead, who proved to be more receptive to indie development. By July 2015, Microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism, with Spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios. Spencer also stated that Microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the Xbox launches of former timed exclusives special in some way , so that customers are not simply purchasing last year's game . Microsoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release. The last official figure was released in November 2014, with the company announcing in October 2015 that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system. On November 22, 2013, Microsoft confirmed that it had sold one million Xbox One consoles within its first 24 hours of being available. Based on approximately 102,000 shopping receipts tracked by InfoScout, 1,500 of which included a purchase of either a video game or a video game console, the Xbox One was the highest selling console during the Black Friday sales period in the United States. On December 11, 2013, Microsoft announced that it had sold approximately 2 million units in its first 18 days on sale. On December 12, 2013, Microsoft announced it was the fastest selling console in the United States, based on NPD Group figures, however the NPD report clarified, PlayStation 4 sales included an additional week within the November data month compared to Xbox One. When looking at sales on an average per week basis, Xbox One led PS4. Keep in mind, however, that supply typically becomes constrained in the second week after launch. On January 6, 2014, Microsoft announced that approximately 3 million consoles had been sold worldwide in 2013. In their Q2 2014 earnings report on January 23, 2014, Microsoft announced that 3.9 million Xbox One units had been shipped worldwide. On November 12, 2014, Microsoft announced it had shipped almost 10 million units to retailers worldwide. The company also revealed that a price cut had tripled U.S. sales of the console over the previous week. On December 11, 2014, Microsoft announced, based on NPD Group figures, that Xbox One was the best selling console in November 2014. With Microsoft's October 2015 announcement that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system, the 10 million figure from November 2014 is still the latest official cumulative sales number. Some journalists think that its lower sales figures than rival PlayStation 4 is the reason behind the decision, to make their system not look bad compared to Sony's. The Xbox One has sold poorly in Japan, continuing the trend of Microsoft's previous consoles which have struggled against the local Sony and Nintendo. The Xbox One sold a total figure of 23,562 consoles within its launch week. By comparison, the Xbox 360 sold 62,000 consoles in Japan during its opening week in 2005. In the week ending June 14, 2015 the Xbox One sold just 100 consoles in Japan in the same week the Wii U sold 16,413 consoles. In January 2016, the CFO of Electronic Arts reported during a financial call that the Xbox One has sold around 18 to 19 million units. This is half of the 36 million units of the PlayStation 4 that Sony claimed at the time, but higher than that of the Xbox One's other main competitor, Nintendo's Wii U, which sold 12.5 million units. Research firm IHS Markit estimated 39.1 million units were sold by the end of March 2018. Video game industry analyst Daniel Ahmad estimated that approximately 41 million units had been sold through 2018. On launch, Xbox One was available in a single retail configuration, which included the console with 500 GB hard drive, one controller, and Kinect sensor. In the United States, it retailed for US 499. On June 9, 2014, Microsoft released a new Xbox One retail configuration that excludes the Kinect sensor, costing US 399. A standalone Kinect sensor for Xbox One for use with these models was released in October 2014, retailing at US 150. On June 16, 2015, Microsoft lowered the price of the stock model to US 349, and released a new US 399 model containing a 1 terabyte hard drive and in some markets, Halo The Master Chief Collection. In May 2016, Microsoft lowered the price of selected 500 GB bundles to US 299, and 1 TB bundles to US 319 as a limited time offer of unspecified length. On June 14, 2016, the price of 500 GB models was lowered once more to US 279 through October 2016, in anticipation of the launch of Xbox One S. On August 31, 2015, Microsoft announced Xbox One Elitea new SKU with a 1 TB solid state hybrid drive and an Elite controller. It was released in November 2015 and retails for US 499.99. In the US, the Elite bundle was a timed exclusive to GameStop and Microsoft Store. Those who pre ordered Xbox One for its release received a special Day One Edition , which featured a DAY ONE 2013 inscriptions on the controller, and a unique achievement. A white Launch Team edition was given exclusively to Microsoft staff members, featuring the inscription I made this, LAUNCH TEAM 2013 on the console and controller, and was bundled with Dead Rising 3, Forza Motorsport 5, Ryse Son of Rome, and Zoo Tycoon. A similar limited edition was gifted to Respawn Entertainment employees following the release of Titanfall, with a black, white, and orange color scheme and a similarly styled controller inspired by the game the controller itself would be released publicly as a tie in . Xbox One consoles bundled with digital copies of specific games have also been released, including Titanfall and Forza Motorsport 5. In August 2018, Microsoft announced that it would, for a limited time, offer a financing program known as Xbox All Access through Microsoft Store in the United States. The program will allow users to purchase an Xbox One S or X console, bundled with subscriptions to both Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass, financed over a two year contract. The customer retains ownership of the console after the two years, and if they break contract prior to that, they must pay the difference on the remaining console cost. The pricing is set to be cheaper overall than purchasing the individual elements alone. The Xbox One S is available in 500 GB, 1 TB, and a special edition 2 TB model, which originally retailed at US 299, 349, and 399 respectively. The 2 TB model was released on August 2, 2016, and 1 TB and 500 GB models were released on August 23, 2016. And a Gears of War 4 special edition was also released. The Xbox One S includes an UHD Blu ray player. On June 11, 2017, Microsoft lowered the prices of the 500 GB Battlefield 1 and 1 TB Forza Horizon 3 Xbox One S console bundles by US 50. At Gamescom 2017, Microsoft unveiled a 1 TB Minecraft limited edition, with a grass block themed hardware and a Creeper themed controller. During an Inside Xbox livestream in September 2018, Microsoft unveiled a 1 TB Fortnite Battle Royale bundle, with online codes to acquire unique in game Eon themed items and currency. On October 9, 2018, Microsoft announced that they would be releasing a 1 TB Minecraft Creators bundle, with a download code for Minecraft, in game currency, DLC packs, and a free trial for Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold. On June 7, 2019, Microsoft released a 1 TB purple Fortnite edition bundle, with in game currency and in game items. On April 16, 2019, Microsoft unveiled an all digital configuration of the Xbox One S named Xbox One S All Digital Edition, which excludes the Blu ray Disc drive. It is a 1 TB model sold at a price of US 249, and is pre loaded with Forza Horizon 3, Minecraft, and Sea of Thieves. The console was released on May 7, 2019. Microsoft first teased the Xbox One X, a high end hardware revision of the Xbox One, at E3 2016 under the codename Project Scorpio , and released it on November 7, 2017 with a 1 TB model priced at US 499, and a limited, pre order exclusive Project Scorpio Edition , with a dark gradient finish, vertical stand brace and green Project Scorpio inscriptions on the console and bundled controller. Like the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X also includes a UHD Blu ray player. The Xbox One X features upgraded hardware, designed primarily to render games at 4K resolution and to provide performance improvements for existing games they can be displayed at full resolution on 4K displays, or supersampled for lower resolution displays. It uses a system on chip SoC known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3 GHz octa core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172 MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12 GB of GDDR5 RAM with 9 GB allocated to games. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31 increase in performance the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console uses a vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console also supports AMD's FreeSync technology, 1440p resolution, and or 120 Hz refresh rate on compatible displays. The Xbox One X is compatible with all existing Xbox One software and accessories. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Halo 5 Guardians, which uses a scaling system that dynamically lowers the game's resolution when needed to maintain a consistent frame rate, was able to run at its native resolution with no scaling on Xbox One X hardware. Phil Spencer touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also support virtual reality, due to its power, price point, and convenience. At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced plans to support Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets on Xbox One in 2018, but the company later stated that it was initially focusing on PC platforms first, and that it wanted to focus on wireless VR solutions for consoles. Games marketed by Microsoft as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware. Separate iconography denotes games that natively run at 4K resolution, or support HDR. Existing games can be updated to provide these enhancements. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow up interview that she was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be up to the game development community what do they want to do . The Xbox One X has been characterized by whom as a competitor to the PlayStation 4 Pro, a hardware update of the PlayStation 4 released in late 2016 that similarly focuses on 4K gaming and improved virtual reality performance, although Phil Spencer stated that the PlayStation 4 Pro's competition is instead the Xbox One S. In October 2016 Penello stated that the performance advantage of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro would be obvious , noting that the PS4 Pro's GPU only had 4.2 teraflops of graphical computing performance in comparison to Microsoft's stated 6 teraflops. Some journalists thought that Microsoft's messaging and positioning of Scorpio alongside the release of the Xbox One S were at odds with themselves and confusing .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox%20One
"XCOM Enemy Unknown is a 2012 turn based tactical video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. The game is a reimagined remake of the 1994 cult classic strategy game UFO Enemy Unknown also known as X COM UFO Defense and a reboot of MicroProse's 1990s X COM series. XCOM Enemy Unknown was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in North America on October 9, 2012, and in Europe and Australia on October 12, 2012. An Elite Edition , containing all previously released downloadable content, was released as a Mac OS X exclusive by Feral Interactive in April 2013. A port for iOS was released in June 2013 and an Android conversion was released in May 2014. An expansion pack, titled XCOM Enemy Within, was released in November 2013. In June 2014, Feral released both XCOM Enemy Unknown and its expansion pack XCOM Enemy Within for Linux. A bundle containing both Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within was launched on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation Vita in March 2016 under the title XCOM Enemy Unknown Plus. Set in an alternative version of year 2015, during an alien invasion of Earth, the game puts the player in control of an elite multinational paramilitary organization called XCOM and is tasked with defending the Earth. The player commands troops in the field in a series of turn based tactical missions between missions, the player directs the research and development of new technologies from recovered alien technology and captured prisoners, expands XCOM's base of operations, manages XCOM's finances, and monitors and responds to alien activity. XCOM Enemy Unknown was critically acclaimed, with several reviewers commenting on the game's difficulty, replayability, and addictiveness. A number of publications, including GameSpy, GameTrailers and Giant Bomb, named it Game of the Year. A sequel to the game, titled XCOM 2, was released on February 5, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Much like its predecessor, XCOM Enemy Unknown casts the player as the commander of an elite military organization. As commander, the player directs their soldiers in turn based combat missions against alien enemies. Between missions, the player directs the organization's research and engineering divisions in creating new technologies and improving XCOM's base of operations, and manages the organization's finances. The turn based ground combat uses a top down 3D perspective. The player controls a squad of between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies normally do not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head up display HUD . A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies. Soldiers can take cover behind walls and objects in the environment to gain a measure of protection. Units can use suppressive fire to disadvantage enemies, and use active camouflage to maneuver around opponents. Cutscenes and dynamic camera movements emphasise particularly exciting gameplay moments, such as kill sequences and use of special abilities. The game includes some tactical role playing elements, whereby the player's soldiers can gain new abilities as they survive more battles. The game's strategy element occurs between missions. XCOM's underground headquarters is presented in a view dubbed the ant farm . From this view, the player manages construction, manufacturing and research projects underway, and directs how the scientists and engineers use resources recovered from missions and received from XCOM's sponsors. A holographic view of the Earth called the Geoscape allows the player to keep track of the situation around the world, ordering aircraft to intercept UFOs and dispatching soldiers to engage aliens on the ground. This also influences the panic level of XCOM's member nations. Responding to situations in certain areas decreases panic, and ignoring them results in a rise in panic and potential for the nation to pull out of XCOM. The ant farm also allows the player to observe the team of soldiers relaxing or exercising at the base's gym. A memorial wall to soldiers killed in action is also viewable. Passive bonuses are provided depending on which continent the player chooses for a base location. The player can better detect alien activity by launching satellites and positioning them over territories of interest. The game can be played on higher difficulty levels Classic in a reference to the original game and Impossible, each with the option to enable the Ironman option which limits players to a single save file separately for each. Jake Solomon, lead developer, stated on numerous occasions that he believes that the truest XCOM experience is playing without the ability to reload saved games. On the higher difficulty levels, the random nature of battles, where soldiers under the player's command can permanently die from one enemy attack, the against all odds nature of combat against the unknown and technologically superior enemy, and the requirement to sacrifice some resources including soldiers and even entire countries for the greater good combine to create a bleak atmosphere where the player feels the weight of command. The game also features a multiplayer mode for one on one tactical battles. Players spend a predefined points budget on assembling a squad of up to six humans, aliens, or a mixture of both. Human units are customizable in terms of weaponry, armor and gadgets. A simplified version of the single player perk system is also present. Alien units may not be customized but possess the abilities of corresponding aliens types in the single player mode of the game. Psionic combat from the original 1994 game is retained, but some gameplay features of the original have been removed or adapted. The time units system, the always visible grid map and the inventory system of the original have been removed. The initial mission phase of disembarking from the transport has also been removed missions now begin with troops deployed outside the craft. Unlike in the 1994 game, only one XCOM base exists, the location of which is chosen at the beginning of the game. Although there are some differences in the interface between platforms, unlike other games such as Firaxis' Civilization Revolution, the content is not simplified for the console versions. The PC version features a mouse driven UI. The game's campaign begins in the spring of 2015, as a global alien invasion begins. Prior to the start of the game, a group of countries called the Council of Nations has banded together to create XCOM short for Extraterrestrial Combat Unit , the most elite military and scientific organization in human history, tasked with defending them from the alien attack. The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, and proceeds to engage in a war against an extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority. After success with shooting down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, as well as interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages to also obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien be captured for interrogation. This also involves developing a specialized weapon capable of capturing a live alien, and constructing a facility in XCOM's subterranean base capable of safely holding a live alien prisoner. Capturing one of the alien troops and conducting the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing one of these, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave in a manner similar to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal it is found to be coming from a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans. XCOM develops a method for gaining entry to the alien base and assaults it. During the mission, the alien serving as the base commander is discovered to have psychic abilities, but is nevertheless defeated by the soldiers. The commander's psychic communication device is recovered and reverse engineered. Tapping into the aliens' communications reveals a previously hidden, stealth Overseer UFO making rounds across the Earth. When the UFO is shot down, it is found to hold an alien species that had not been previously encountered, as well as a strange psionic artifact. The newly discovered species, called Ethereals, possess powerful psionic abilities. Once the Overseer ship is shot down and the psionic artifact recovered, the massive enemy Temple Ship reveals itself in low Earth orbit over Brazil, and starts causing earthquakes even as far away as XCOM HQ. The reverse engineering efforts enable XCOM to unlock and develop latent psionic powers that are present in certain human beings, thus enhancing their human soldiers. Out of these psychic human soldiers, the most powerful becomes the Volunteer, using the psionic artifact recovered from the Overseer UFO to tap into the aliens' psychic communication hive , an experience that also increases his or her psionic strength. This allows them to attack and board the Temple Ship to seek out the Uber Ethereal, the leader of the alien invasion. During the final battle aboard the ship, the Uber Ethereal reveals that, because of their own failure to improve their own race further, they have been testing and experimenting on other species throughout the universe in an attempt to identify a race worthy of being Uplifted , searching for a race that is strong in both mind and body the various species of alien troops that the player has encountered have all been failures in the Ethereals' experiments. By allowing humans to obtain their technology a few steps at a time, the Ethereals allowed humans to evolve to a fuller potential, and believe that humanity may be the culmination of their search, to find the perfect species to move on and prepare for what lies ahead , a vaguely worded destiny that they do not describe further. After slaying the Uber Ethereal, the Temple Ship begins to collapse into itself, creating a black hole, which would destroy the Earth due to its close proximity. While the psionically gifted Volunteer urges the other XCOM soldiers to rush back to their transport and escape the doomed ship, the Volunteer stays behind, using the psychic gift to take control of the ship and fly it further away from the planet, finally causing it to self destruct and save Earth, though at cost of the Volunteer's own life. The game went into development in early 2008 as a very, very big budget project with about 5060 team members led by Jake Solomon. Its prototype was a straightforward remake of the original 1994 game UFO Enemy Unknown with all the classic gameplay features. The game subsequently went through many revisions, and features were added, tested or removed to create the final result. XCOM Enemy Unknown was developed independently of 2K Marin's XCOM later rebranded as The Bureau XCOM Declassified , and although the two games are set in entirely different universes, the developers of both games were in contact with one another, As in the expansion Enemy Within, after researching Meld it says Dr. Vahlen discovered some records from the 60s which shows that maybe they were in the same universe. Enemy Unknown was also the first title developed by Firaxis Games not to feature the name of Sid Meier, who served as the director of creative development but was not directly involved in the game's development day to day. The designers also made an internal board game to help get the feel of the game right. The interface team was split into halves to develop separate GUIs for the PC and console releases. All members of the development team played and finished the original Enemy Unknown game they were required to do so if they had not already when they joined the team. Roland Rizzo, who has been working with the X COM series since the beginning, became the audio lead for the game and was tasked with reimagining and updating John Broomhall's famous original music score. Michael McCann, composer for Deus Ex Human Revolution, was also involved in creating the game's musical score. The Civilization series' art director Greg Foertsch was given the task of reimagining the look of X COM, including redesigning the classic alien species. The aim was to have the characters resemble action figures, and the result was a stylized, bright, flat textured look. XCOM Enemy Unknown was first revealed on January 5, 2012 by Game Informer. A playable demo of the game was available at Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 in June 2012. Pre order bonuses included the Classic X COM Soldier a haircut for the player's male soldier based on the model for troops in the original 1994 X COM and the option to customize the aesthetic design of soldiers' armor. Those pre ordering the PC version on Steam also received bonus items for Valve's Team Fortress 2 and a free copy of Firaxis' 2010 strategy game Civilization V. The game's playable demo version was released on September 24, 2012 for Steam, on October 9 for the Xbox Live available for the Gold subscribers of the Xbox Marketplace and on October 10 for the PlayStation Network. Eight custom promotional XCOM Enemy Unknown arcade cabinets were produced in August 2011 by 2K Games and Bespoke Arcades. The machines were used to run tournaments of the game at various exhibitions including i47, London MCM Expo, Play Expo and Eurogamer Expo with the machines being awarded as prizes. XCOM Enemy Unknown was released in stores on October 9, 2012 for North American consumers and on October 12, 2012 for Australian and European consumers. The game was released for digital distribution via Steam on October 9, 2012. On PC, two editions were released a normal edition and a special edition which includes a variety of unique items, including an art book, a fold out poster of the XCOM headquarters, an XCOM insignia patch, and a collection of digital bonus assets such as desktop wallpapers, soundtrack and more. An Elite Edition , containing all previously released DLC, was announced as a Mac OS X exclusive by Feral Interactive on February 26, 2013 and was released on April 25, 2013. An iOS port, scheduled to be released in the summer of 2013, was announced during a PAX East panel on March 23, 2013. The game was released on June 20, 2013 at the App Store for 19.99, at the time one of the most expensive iOS games ever released. The game was available digitally between June 16 and 30, 2016 on the Xbox 360 as part of Xbox Live's Games with Gold. An expansion pack, XCOM Enemy Within was released worldwide on Steam and in retail stores on November 15, 2013. The pack retains the core storyline but adds a broad variety of content, including new weapons, special missions and the ability to enhance soldiers via genetic engineering or cybernetic implants. Both of those options consume an elusive substance called Meld that can be obtained during battles. XCOM Enemy Unknown greatly impressed the public and media at E3 2012, where it won a number of awards from a variety of gaming publications, such as the title of Best Strategy Game from GameSpy, Game Informer, IGN, and Machinima. The game also won the titles Best PC Game and Best Strategy Game in the 2012 E3 Game Critics Awards. A pre release version of XCOM Enemy Unknown received highly positive previews by, among others, PlayStation Official Magazine, Official Xbox Magazine and Rock, Paper, Shotgun. The full version of the game also received a high praise from critics. Adam Biessener of Game Informer called it a singular achievement that every gamer deserves to experience. Ian Dransfield of PLAY called the game a phenomenal reimagining of a classic title and an instant classic in its own right. It was also described as a hallmark of excellence by Destructoid and an exemplary turn based strategy game by Joystiq. Dan Stapleton of GameSpy wrote I consider the 1994 turn based tactical masterpiece X COM UFO Defense to be the single best videogame ever made. Compared directly to that impossibly high standard, Firaxis' 2012 remake, XCOM Enemy Unknown, does remarkably well. GamesTM called it a worthy reboot of the franchise, easily the most addictive game this year, and one of our favourite Firaxis games ever, with the final verdict of it being fresh, yet authentic a stunning reboot. Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM stated that to say that XCOM Enemy Unknown is a phenomenal remake would be selling Firaxis' monumental accomplishment short. The developer hasn't just managed to capture the spirit of the original they've also tweaked, trimmed, and innovated enough to deliver the freshest, most engaging strategy game in recent memory, if not ever. Eurogamer's review by Rich Stanton described XCOM Enemy Unknown as a winner and a fantastic game that brings back and revitalises a classic. Alex Rubens of G4 called it an exceptionally solid return for the series, and one that every turn based tactics fan should experience, adding that even if you never played the original, XCOM Enemy Unknown is turn based tactics and management at its finest, and a perfect introduction to the genre. David Houghton of Game Revolution said that despite its flaws, the game feels like the revival of not just a brand, but a genre. Polygon's Russ Pitts criticized the weird dichotomy of the game's strategy component, but praised the tactical gameplay, calling it one of the best and most artfully designed strategy games in recent memory. Edwin Evans Thirlwell of Official Xbox Magazine stated that it isn't just Xbox 360's finest strategy experience it's also a strategy game which changes how you think about strategy games. The game's difficulty received both praise and concern. G4's review noted that the extreme difficulty of the game might not be welcomed by all players and Official Xbox Magazine described the game as reliably unforgiving . According to EGM, XCOM hates you. XCOM wants you dead. And XCOM will see you dead, over and over again. Game Informer called it one of the most challenging, intense gaming experiences of this generation. PLAY's review stated, dying is back in fashion. Several reviews also commented on how addictive the game can be for the player. David Houghton of PlayStation Official Magazine called XCOM one of the most unique and endlessly compulsive games of the year so far. Erik Kain of Forbes called it one of the most addictive games I've ever played that falls somewhere between chocolate and crack on the scale of addictive substances. Allistair Pinsof of Destructoid, in pointing out how easily one could be absorbed in the game, told readers to take the act of me wiping XCOM from my hard drive as high praise. It speaks volumes on how addictive and replayable XCOM is. In a retrospective article about the original from 1994, Alec Meer of Eurogamer compared both games, coming to conclusion that X COM and XCOM are completely different games, both ingenious and both flawed in their own ways. According to Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com, Enemy Unknown is respectful of Julian Gollop's 1994 turn based strategy classic, but it's not reverential. Charlie Hall of Ars Technica wrote that in the end, this is not the X Com that everyone was expecting. It's more. It's better. If you're merely looking for a highly competent re skin of the original X Com, keep your eyes peeled for the upcoming Xenonauts. Gollop himself said I think Firaxis did a terrific job with the new XCOM. They have made a very console friendly and accessible game, but it still has a lot of strategic and tactical depth. The character progression is done very well, and the tactical combat system is great. I would have done things differently for sure. I was a bit disappointed that the Geoscape is basically irrelevant, with no strategy involved about positioning of bases, detection ranges, base attacks and so on. It is also a shame that there is no random map generation. The development of the alien menace seems to be driven by specific events, such as the first alien base assault, rather than the aliens own development agenda as in the original X Com. Multiple publications including Giant Bomb, Kotaku, MTV and GameTrailers gave XCOM Enemy Unknown their overall Game of the Year award for 2012. GameSpy also gave XCOM its Game of the Year award Achievements Game of the Year, High Tension, Making Turn Based Cool Again , commenting that few games can deliver the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in the way that XCOM does. XCOM Enemy Unknown was chosen by the 2012 Spike TV Video Game Awards as a nominee in the category Best PC Game. At the 16th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, it was nominated for three awards, including Game of the Year, and ended up winning two for 2012's Strategy Simulation Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering. Awarding the game its title of Strategy Game of the Year, PC Gamer wrote it can be forging player memories that'll live as long as you play and care about games. A sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2, was released on February 5, 2016. It was developed by Firaxis Games and was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. At release it was a PC only game. The game takes place 20 years after the events of Enemy Unknown, in an alternate scenario where XCOM failed to stop the alien invasion and humanity surrenders. The player controls a small resistance movement fighting against the alien conquerors.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM%3A%20Enemy%20Unknown
"Xenoblade Chronicles is an open world action role playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Wii. Initially released in Japan in 2010, it was later released in the PAL region in 2011 and then in North America in 2012. A port for the New Nintendo 3DS was released worldwide in 2015, and a remaster for the Nintendo Switch is scheduled to be released in 2020. Xenoblade Chronicles is the first entry in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, a subseries which forms part of the Xeno metaseries. Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous Xeno games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both fantasy and science fiction. The game features navigation through an open world split into zones, side quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real time action based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future. Xenoblade Chronicles takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human like Homs, are in a perpetual war with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist Shulk discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses. The concept for Xenoblade Chronicles originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, Tetsuya Takahashi, visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title Monado The Beginning of the World, though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans Yoko Shimomura and Yasunori Mitsuda, with the latter writing the ending theme. The game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role playing games, while its port was praised for successfully re creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A spiritual successor by the same development team for the Wii U, Xenoblade Chronicles X, was released in 2015. A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, was simultaneously released worldwide in 2017. Xenoblade Chronicles plays as an action role playing video game RPG , where the player controls one character out of a party of three using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk or the Classic Controller. The game employs an open world design, with players able to freely navigate seamlessly interconnected environments. A day and night time cycle exists in the game, with the time of day often affecting in game events, quests, enemy strengths, and item availability for instance, stronger enemy types appear at night. While time flows automatically and a day cycle repeats about every ten minutes in real time, players can adjust the in game clock to the desired time at any point. Additionally, while the game is about exploration, many areas, called Landmarks aid in traversing the land by serving as warp points, allowing the player to instantly return to that point at any time. The game also supports a save anywhere feature, where players can save at any point outside battle. The game also contains a New Game mode, which pulls over much of the player's progress from their first playthrough into future playthroughs. Exploration, quest completion, and item collection are large parts of the gameplay. The player is encouraged to explore the large environments, which generally allow the player to visit whatever can be seen in the horizon. While exploring, the player may choose to take on side quests from various non player characters that inhabit the game's world, as they commonly involve locating certain items or killing a certain number of enemy characters. When the necessary requirements are fulfilled, some of the quests are completed automatically without the player needing to manually notify in game characters of its completion. Item collection plays a role in the game in the form of the game's Collectopaedia . Scattered across the game are glowing blue orbs, and upon coming into contact with the orb, the player is awarded a random item that they can add to the Collectopaedia when a certain number are collected, the player is rewarded with new items. Aside from the Collectopaedia, there are also ether crystals to be found from fallen enemies or ether crystal deposits, which give the player access to a multifaceted Gem Crafting mini game, allowing for the creation of gems that may increase battle stats when equipped. Many in game systems affect the general flow of gameplay. The Affinity system tracks the relationships between characters and locations in the game. Location Affinity tracks the interpersonal relationships between all of the game's named characters, depicting to which degree they get along with one another, and a town's general perception of the player's controllable party. Completing quests can alter perception of the characters, and open up additional story sequences. There is also Party Affinity , which is strictly the level of affection between each party member, ranging from indifference to love. These affinities can be raised by having characters participate in battle together, giving gifts, or using the Heart to Heart system. These Heart to Hearts are intimate moments between two characters that can show more of a character's personality, history, or thoughts, and can be initiated by having a certain level of Affinity between them. The Affinity system ties into how efficient characters work together in battle and gem crafting. The game also has an extensive customization system, which includes changing the characters' outfits and weapons. These changes are directly reflected in the game, appearing in the field and even during scripted cutscenes. Xenoblade Chronicles has a real time action based battle system, where the player manually moves the current lead character in real time, and party members will auto attack when enemies enter their attack radius. Manually input attacks, called Arts , may also be performed by the player, but in a limited fashion. Battle Arts are only available after a cool down period that occurs after every use, while character specific Talent Arts only become available after enough auto attacks are executed. Both party members and enemies have a finite amount of health points, and attacks deplete this value. Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP, but the game is lost if the player's character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived. Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player experience points, which allows the characters to grow stronger by leveling up and learning new Arts. Arts for each character must be set by the player on their respective set up, called a Battle Palette , outside battles. Several other systems are present to affect the flow of battle. The Party Gauge slowly fills as party members successfully land hits on the enemy players, and filling the gauge allows the player to chain multiple attacks together, for extra damage. All party members have an aggro ring around them as well the more actions a character performs, the larger it grows. Larger aggro rings lead enemies to focus their efforts on that respective character, leading to a strategic aspect of luring and diverting attention of enemies. Each character has a Tension gauge, which represents a character's morale at its highest point, characters have a high probability of dealing a critical blow and less chance of missing an enemy. The game's Vision system, where main character Shulk can see glimpses of enemies' future attacks, also factors into battles. With knowledge of an enemy's potentially dangerous attack, the player can prevent it from happening by alerting a teammate, allowing the player to activate one of their Arts, or by using an Art of their own to stop the attack. The Vision system is tied to the Party gauge, which is filled by boosting team morale, using Arts with special effects, and avoiding or dealing critical hits. The three tiered gauge gradually depletes outside of battle, and one tier is needed to either revive characters or alert a teammate to a vision. When all three tiers are full, the party can execute a chain attack. The setting of Xenoblade Chronicles originates in a world that was nothing but endless ocean until two titanic gods, the Bionis and the Mechonis, came into existence and battled each other until only their frozen corpses remained. In the eons following their battle, they became the home of multiple forms of life. The Bionis is home to organic lifeforms, most prominently the humanoid Homs, who are virtually identical to humans both in appearance and biology the diminutive and furry Nopon, and the avian humanoid High Entia, whose lifespans span centuries. Conversely, the Mechonis is home to the mechanical humanoid Machina, whose lifespans span several millennia. A key weapon used by the Homs in the battle against Mechonis is the Monado, a mystical sword which grants visions of the future to its wielder when fully controlled. The game's main character is Shulk, a young Homs scientist who lives in Colony 9 on Bionis. During an attack by Machina warriors called Mechon, Shulk comes into possession of the Monado. During his journey, Shulk is joined by Reyn, one of Shulk's childhood friends and headstrong member of the Defence Force Dunban, a former wielder of the Monado and the brother of Shulk's childhood friend Fiora, who also joins Shulk Sharla, a medic and sniper from Colony 6 Melia Antiqua, princess of the High Entia and a High Entia Hom hybrid and Riki, a Nopon chosen as the hero of his village. Other important characters include Zanza, god of the Bionis and the game's main antagonist Lady Meyneth, goddess of the Mechonis Shulk's mentor Dickson Mumkhar, a cowardly soldier who fought alongside Dunban and wished to wield the Monado for himself Egil, self proclaimed leader of the Machina and Alvis, a mysterious man who aids Shulk on his journey. The game's opening details events one year past, when Dickson, Dunban, and Mumkhar were fighting a Mechon army. Mumkhar deserts and the Monado paralyzes Dunban's right arm after he uses it to defeat the Mechon. In the present, Shulk studies the Monado in Colony 9, where Dunban and Fiora live. A group of Mechon, led by the Face Mechon Metal Face, soon attack Colony 9. Dunban is almost killed when he attempts to use the Monado again, prompting Shulk to try and use it he wields it with ease and receives visions of the future from it. While the Mechon are driven back, Metal Face proves immune to the Monado and kills Fiora before fleeing. Swearing revenge against Metal Face, Shulk sets out together with Reyn. They meet Sharla from the decimated Colony 6 and work to free it from Mechon occupation, reuniting with Dunban shortly thereafter. Guided by Shulk's vision, the group travels to the High Entia capital to enter Prison Island, joined by Melia and Riki. Shulk also meets Alvis, who shares Shulk's ability to wield the Monado. Gaining entry, they encounter Zanza, a being who created the Monado and who offers Shulk the ability to destroy the Face Mechon, revealed to be humans inside Mechon mechs. Though Shulk accepts and the Monado is granted the ability to destroy humans, Metal Face attacks with another Faced Mechon called Face Nemesis and seemingly kills Zanza, also killing Melia's father. During the ensuing battle, Face Nemesis is damaged to reveal a recreated and amnesiac Fiora controlling it. While initially disheartened by this, Shulk is rallied by his comrades and sets out in pursuit of Metal Face and Fiora. During a peaceful encounter with Fiora, Metal Face attacks them again, revealing itself to be Mumkhar after blackmailing Shulk into surrendering the Monado. Melia attacks Mumkhar, disarming him and allowing Dunban to battle him, interrogating Mumkhar about why he committed all his crimes. Egil then intervenes, spiriting Fiora away. On the way to the Mechonis, the party face off against and defeat Mumkhar, who they decide to spare. Mumkhar, however, is enraged and tries to attack them, impaling himself on a giant sword decoration and plummeting to his death. The party battle Egil and Fiora. In the resultant fight, Shulk and Fiora are separated from the group. During their time together, Shulk successfully awakens Fiora's memories and learns that another being was controlling her body. Reuniting with the group, they meet up with the friendly Machina Linada and her people, the Machina. She reveals that the Bionis and Mechonis were initially at peace, before the Bionis' god Zanza launched an unprovoked attack, forcing the Mechonis goddess Meyneth to wound him enough for the High Entia to entrap him. Since the battle a year before, Egil has been working on his own to convert the life of Bionis into Mechon to render the Monado useless, as it feeds off the ether found in all Homs. Going to face Egil, Fiora is taken over by the other presence, Meyneth, who reveals that, after being wounded in the fight with Zanza, she went to sleep before being drawn to Fiora by her love for Shulk. They reach Egil as he reactivates the Mechonis and begins an attack on the Bionis, intent on destroying the Bionis as revenge for the decimation it had caused to the Machina thousands of years ago. Despite fighting him, Shulk manages to make him see that they both wish for a return to peace, and declines the open opportunity to kill Egil upon the latter's defeat. At this point, Dickson appears and shoots Shulk, revealing himself as a disciple of Zanza, who emerges from Shulk's body and reclaims the Monado. They reveal that Zanza resided inside Shulk's body after he was killed during in expedition to claim the Monado, and Dickson has been preparing Shulk to take control of the Monado and eventually awaken Zanza. Egil and Meyneth attempt to fight Zanza, but they are defeated and Meyneth's Monado is stolen. As the party escapes, Egil attempts to fight once more, but Zanza destroys both him and the Mechonis. After the Mechonis' destruction, Zanza transforms the pure blooded High Entia into Telethia, who purge Bionis of life. The party is helpless before the Telethia, but a squadron of High Entia intervenes to protect them. However, the High Entia Minister of Research Lorithia is revealed to be Zanza's disciple, and releases ether to transform the High Entia squadron into Telethia. While the party grieves for Shulk, Shulk awakens thanks to Alvis and manages to defeat a Telethia raid on Colony 6, but Alvis is revealed to be the third disciple of Zanza, though Shulk suspects an ulterior motive. Making their way to Prison Island, they defeat Lorithia and Dickson. The party then travels to face Zanza, who declares the life of Bionis as simply his food and vessels, and with both Monados, he intends to recreate the world as he has before, destroying the current world and both everyone and everything in it in the process. Zanza then offers Shulk the chance to become his new disciple. Shulk rejects the offer, and during the ensuing battle produces a third Monado prompted by Alvis, the spirit of the Monado who betrays Zanza, Shulk uses his Monado to destroy Zanza. Alvis then shows Shulk Zanza's origins both Zanza, then named Klaus, and Meyneth were originally human scientists from Earth working to create a new universe aboard a space station of which Alvis was the administrative computer. Klaus's obsessive desires caused the experiment to end in disaster, obliterating the universe and causing Zanza and Meyneth to be reborn as gods. After the new universe's creation, Zanza and Meyneth created life in their image, and Zanza created the cycle of Bionis out of fear that he would eventually die as his creations forgot of his existence and sought life beyond Bionis. With Zanza threatening the universe, Alvis asks Shulk, now a god, to decide how he will remake the universe. Shulk wishes for a world without gods, where everyone can decide their own fates. In the new universe, the survivors of Bionis and Mechonis build a new settlement and live peacefully together, Fiora is restored to her Homs form, and both she and Shulk optimistically look forward to Alvis' parting promise of endless worlds and races of people beyond their own. Xenoblade Chronicles was developed by Japanese development company Monolith Soft, with Tetsuya Takahashi forming the original concept and serving as the game's executive director. Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on Xenogears, then on the Xenosaga trilogy after founding Monolith Soft in 1999. Xenosaga was intended to be a six part series, but low commercial performances forced the planned Xenosaga series to be halved. After these events, the entire development team was in a state of low morale. The initial concept for Xenoblade Chronicles, of people living on the bodies of gigantic gods, came to Takahashi in June 2006. Struck by his idea, he immediately committed it to paper and showed the draft to other senior staff, who were favorably impressed. One of them, an executive called Yasuyuki Honne, thought it would make a good 3D model and bought materials to create it. Construction began in July during this period, younger staff acted as models so that Takahashi could establish which parts of the gods' bodies could be used as habitable and navigable environments in various poses. After the model's construction, Takahashi decided to combine the model's concept with an unrelated story idea, which became the basis for a new game after positive feedback from staff. Takahashi later said that one of the main reasons for developing the game was to bolster team morale after the commercial failure of the Xenosaga games. The team first showed their proposal to Nintendo prior to the final development stages of Disaster Day of Crisis. Development began over four years prior to its release, with the first prototypes for the game being developed in April 2007. It was at this point that co director Genki Yokota was brought in by Nintendo to handle any system related issues due to his previous experience with RPGs. After being contacted regarding both Xenoblade Chronicles and fellow Wii JRPG The Last Story, head of Nintendo's licensing department Shinji Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a romanticist approach . Takahashi was involved in every aspect of the game's development, from its initial concept to the debugging stage. At the beginning of development, the game was going to be a stand alone title unrelated to the Xeno series, bearing the title Monado The Beginning of the World. Later, then Nintendo president Satoru Iwata had the title changed to its current one to honor both Takahashi's previous titles and the effort he was investing in Xenoblade Chronicles. According to Takahashi, the Xeno designation was more along the lines of a symbol, calling back to the previous works of Monolith Soft. When describing the title's meaning, Takahashi described Xeno as meaning different nature or uniqueness , while the Blade part was closely tied to the narrative, particularly the game's ending. A key element of the game for Takahashi was creating an ideal balance between gameplay and story, something that he felt was lacking in other JRPGs which focused too much on story. Takahashi's previous experiences with the Xenosaga games and Baten Kaitos Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, which had been called out for being old fashioned when compared to other RPGs of the day, influenced his work in this regard. The mechanic of Shulk getting glimpses of the future became the foundation of the entire battle system. Takahashi briefly experimented with a turn based battle system that incorporated the feature, but it did not work out. In a separate issue, Takahashi decided against a transition between the environment and a battle arena as he felt such a transition would negatively interrupt the flow of gameplay. The game features a fully open world, which was described by Takahashi as overwhelming, like an MMORPG , describing the world size as being roughly equivalent to the Japanese archipelago. The scale of the world was derived from Takahashi's wish to showcase the grandeur of the experience. In addition to this, the number and length of cutscenes was cut down significantly from those present in the Xenosaga games, with Takahashi considering such a development method as having become a dead end . The wish for an expansive world also became tied up with the wish to reward players for exploration, which entailed the creating of a huge amount of content creation such as items and accessories. The gameplay was influenced both by previous Japanese RPGs and Western RPGs. When the team ran into difficulties, Takahashi went to Nintendo in a deflated state to suggest numerous means of meeting the game's projected deadline. Yamagami rejected all of Takahashi's proposals and instead insisted the team persist with their vision, saying he would persuade Nintendo to continue supporting them. The scenario was created by Takahashi, Yuichiro Takeda and Yurie Hattori. Takahashi was responsible for creating the main concept, but as he was going to be director and executive producer, he was unable to also take on full script writing duties, so he asked Takeda to be his partner in creating the scenario. Takeda was a writer for anime who had previously collaborated with Takahashi on adaptations of the first Xenosaga game, in addition to writing the script for Xenosaga I II, the Nintendo DS remake of Xenosaga and its sequel. Takahashi deliberately chose someone outside the video game industry as he wanted a different perspective on the story's pacing. Hattori was brought in during the early development stages due to her experience with scenarios for Nintendo games, which enabled her to look at Takahashi and Takeda's scenario from an objective viewpoint. A key element in the scenario was contrasting senses of scale, which Takahashi described as contrasting the realms of the micro and the macro , while the main story themes were characters embarking on a great and evolving journey, and overcoming a predetermined future. Despite multiple fantasy elements, Xenoblade Chronicles is based within a science fiction premise, although such elements were kept low key during the first part of the game. Despite their earlier work together, it was the first time Takahashi and Takeda were so intimately involved in a project. Takeda found working on the project more difficult than he initially anticipated his standard writing form was for the anime series format, which was limited to 20 25 minute episodes. With Xenoblade Chronicles, the volume of story and writing work was much larger and offered more freedom for dramatic expression. Conversely, his previous experience enabled Takahashi to easily plan the structure and scheduling for the game. During the initial writing stages, Takahashi did not give precise instructions to Takeda he instead gave a rough outline that they worked on together, then they passed the developing script between themselves, along with producers Shingo Kawabata and Koh Kojima, to iron out rough elements. Takahashi compared it to playing a game of catch, something he was unused to doing for his game scenarios. The ending underwent revisions while Takahashi and Takeda felt they had created a fairly explanatory ending, Hattori still felt unsatisfied. After a second look, Takahashi and Takeda realized that it would appear perplexing for someone outside the writing process, so they rewrote it to be more player friendly. The final script contained a large amount of dialogue the sheer volume, which included dialogue spoken in battle, made for a difficult experience while recording. Due to all the effort, Takahashi was emphatic that as much of it as possible be used, although he sometimes felt that there was too much. In the end, some dialogue needed to be cut as testers felt that the characters talked too much. Takahashi's overall writing style was made deliberately more mature and subdued than other games within the genre. One of the elements that was of great concern to both Takahashi and Takeda was the main protagonist Shulk. Takahashi had noticed that, in the majority of RPGs, the main protagonist was all too easily disliked even if other characters became fan favorites. Consequently, one of the main priorities was to make Shulk as appealing as possible to players. During this process, it was suggested that Shulk be a silent protagonist, but there was a general wish from the staff for him to speak. In addition to this, Takahashi needed to confront the problem faced in any RPG with voiced characters, which was developing them suitably and writing appropriate dialogue between them. The companion character Riki was cited by Takeda as a favorite of his on paper Riki sounded an unlikable character, but his voice and appearance acted as a counterbalance to his remarks. One of the scenes where Hattori had input was a scene between Shulk and Fiora which showcased their connection the original scene had Shulk touching Fiora's cheek, which Harrori felt would look creepy coming out of the blue. The scene was altered so Shulk touched her hand instead. One of the early concepts Takeda suggested was that one of the main protagonist's party would betray them and become the final boss, but Takahashi rejected this idea as he felt it would run counter to player expectation. During the course of its development, the story underwent so many revisions that Takahashi forgot what his original concept was, although the basic framework remained intact throughout. The original score for Xenoblade Chronicles was composed by Manami Kiyota, ACE a musical production group composed of Tomori Kudo, Hiroyo CHiCO Yamanaka, and Kenji Hiramatsu , and Yoko Shimomura. As with other parts of development, Takahashi was deeply involved, constantly rejecting pieces due to what he felt was not fitting for the game. He admitted that this was due to early samples he had given the team for his vision for the music, which they had followed too faithfully for his liking. At Takahashi's request, Nobuo Uematsu's record label Dog Ear Records assisted with production. The music team was led by Shimomura, who was initially very confused by the odd naming of tracks, along with getting the opportunity of using sounds not normally used in compositions in her other projects, such as electric guitars. Kiyota had only previously done superficial work on video game titles she accepted Dog Ear Records' offer for her to compose music. ACE was recommended to Takahashi by Dog Ear Records. Kiyota handled environmental tracks, while ACE was in charge of battle tracks in addition to other musical pieces. The team's main goal was to create music that went beyond the typical sound of RPGs. In hindsight, Yamanaka attributed the harmony of the six composers' works to Takahashi's organization and overall direction. The final score contained around ninety tracks. One of the hardest tracks for Shimomura was a nine minute track that Takahashi requested to match with a movie scene. Later, he said the track needed to change midway through, essentially necessitating the creation of two conjoined themes. The majority of the game's music was written by Kiyota and ACE , with Shimomura writing eleven tracks. The music was recorded at Burnish Stone Recording Studios in Tokyo. The chorus work was provided by Yamanaka, Kiyota, and Masao Koori. The game's ending theme, Beyond the Sky , was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and performed in English by Australian singer Sarah Alainn. Mitsuda was brought in to the music team due to his previous experience with the soundtracks of Xenogears and the first Xenosaga game, and due to Takahashi's long working relationship with him. Takahashi himself personally wrote the original Japanese lyrics for the track, which were translated into English by Lisa Gomamoto. When Mitsuda was contacted, the project was nearing completion, with very little development and composition work left. Despite this, before creating the main theme, Mitsuda asked if he could read the script, which was much larger than he anticipated. The track caused much stress to Mitsuda, who was tasked to create the game's most important song, which needed to incorporate both the diversity of the entire rest of the soundtrack, and mesh with Takahashi's grand vision for the ending of the game. An official soundtrack album for the game, Xenoblade Original Soundtrack, was released by Dog Ear Records on 23 June 2010. It entered the Oricon charts at 80, and remained in the charts for five weeks. Upon release, the album received praise from critics while multiple critics were surprised that Shimomura and Mitsuda's contributions were less substantial than originally thought, they found the majority of the music composed by Kiyota and ACE to be enjoyable. Beyond the Sky also received unanimous praise. Xenoblade Chronicles was announced during E3 2009. Its official title and release window were not announced until the beginning of 2010, alongside the announcement of The Last Story. The game released in Japan on 10 June 2010. Over a year after its Japanese release, it was confirmed for release in European territories under the title Xenoblade Chronicles. This version included both the English and Japanese voice tracks. According to Adam Howden, Shulk's voice actor, he was not given much information prior to his audition, and was never given the full script during recording. According to him, the translated script needed to be altered as some lines came out as longer or shorter than the Japanese originals, and he was told to give Shulk a neutral British accented voice. Concerning the game's localization, Takahashi stated that while some minor changes were made in the English versions of the game, like some bug fixes, minor adjustments to gameplay balance, and slight rewriting of some written content, none of the changes led to any significant differences. Initially planned for release on 2 September 2011, it was released two weeks early on 19 August. In addition to the standard edition, a special edition with a Red Wii Controller Pro was also released. It was later re released in Europe on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop on 5 August 2015. Despite being confirmed for a European release, Xenoblade Chronicles did not have an official confirmation of a North American release. Additionally, although the project was announced at E3 2009, the finished game was absent altogether from E3 2011. In an interview on the French television station Nolife, Mathieu Minel, the marketing manager of Nintendo France, stated that Nintendo of Europe had desired to show the game at it, but Nintendo of America would not allow it, sparking speculation that it would not be released in North America. In response to this, a dedicated fan campaign was launched called Operation Rainfall. Its goal was to raise fan awareness of the situations felt by three Wii RPGs Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's Tower. Among the campaign tactics used by Operation Rainfall were emails, organized campaigns, online petitions, phone calls, and messages on Nintendo's Facebook and Twitter accounts. One of the most notable efforts was a call to pre order the game via the original Monado Beginning of the World placeholder on Amazon.com. Their efforts resulted in Xenoblade Chronicles becoming 1 in the site's pre order gaming charts, beating The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D and the PlayStation 3 bundle for Call of Duty Black Ops. The campaign also received support from Mistwalker, the developers of The Last Story, and Xenogears and Xenosaga writer Soraya Saga. Takahashi later stated that Monolith Soft developed the game assuming that it would be released overseas. In the months following these activities, Nintendo of America officially stated that there were no current plans to release the three asked for games in North America, despite acknowledging the great demand for the titles. Rumors eventually emerged that the title would see a North American release when it was listed on the website of gaming retailer GameStop. Soon after this, Nintendo officially announced that the game would be released in the region. In a 2013 interview, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aime revealed that Nintendo were considering an American release for Xenoblade Chronicles while Operation Rainfall was active, and that while the campaign did not factor into their decision, they were aware of it and took it into account while deciding whether the release would make a profitable release. Xenoblade Chronicles eventually released in North America on 6 April 2012. It was released in North America as an exclusive to Nintendo's American store, and GameStop's website and stores. The eShop version released for North America from 28 April 2016. A port for the New Nintendo 3DS, called Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, was released worldwide in April 2015. It features StreetPass functionality, as well as compatibility with the Shulk Amiibo. The port was originally announced in August 2014 alongside the New Nintendo 3DS. The port was developed by Monster Games, a frequent collaborator with Nintendo on well received ports. They were requested for the job by Nintendo as the staff at Monolith Soft were already working on the next Xenoblade title. Development on the port started between Autumn and Winter 2013 initially for the original Nintendo 3DS, but initial testing showed that the original platform lacked the memory and power to effectively run the game, since the Wii's processing capabilities were greater than the regular 3DS. Hearing about the New 3DS, it was decided to use its increased processing power to realize the game's ambition. Its increased power made the port possible, and its button layout, with the inclusion of the ZL and ZR shoulder buttons and the C Stick, meant that the original Wii Classic Controller button layout could be used without adjustment. As part of the alterations made to the title, much of the on screen information was moved down to the bottom Touch screen so as to de clutter the top screen, while the layout was carefully arranged so as to maintain the feel of the original as much as possible. To maintain frame rate and the seamless transitions between environments, unspecified technical tricks were used. They also worked hard to include 3D capacity despite the resultant technical difficulties. The most difficult part of the development was getting the game's scale to work within the new hardware. This entailed the creation of a new graphics engine with a custom visibility culling and complex level of detail systems. All of the environments were rebuilt and optimized for the new system while keeping the original aesthetic intact. The reason given for porting the game to the New 3DS rather than the Wii U home console was that the length of the game could be intimidating for the modern gamer, who was becoming more used to on the go, quick gaming sessions. A high definition remaster, called Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition, was announced in September 2019 during the Nintendo Direct presentation. It is scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch in 2020. Since its release, Xenoblade Chronicles has received critical acclaim, earning perfect scores from Digital Spy, Joystiq, GamePro and RPGamer, and near perfect scores from most other video gaming websites and magazines. The game received universal acclaim , according to review aggregator Metacritic. The story was cited by many as being innovative and enjoyable despite a fairly standard premise, while its open nature was seen as a welcome change for the genre IGN critic Keza MacDonald said that she had been shocked out of expecting Japanese RPGs to be similar to the linear and story driven Final Fantasy XIII. Its battle system and handling of quests also received praise, with the latter being seen as a great improvement for the genre due to its user friendly workings. The one point that generally drew criticism were the graphics, with multiple critics disappointed that they lacked the polish of other contemporary consoles. IGN, Eurogamer and Edge Magazine cited the game as a triumphant comeback for the JRPG, and a prime example of the genre. The battle system, and to a degree its general gameplay, was favorably compared by multiple critics to that used in Final Fantasy XII. The New 3DS port also received generally positive reviews, according to Metacritic. The port was generally received similar praise to the original Xenoblade Chronicles many points of praise regarding its gameplay and story were shared with its original release, while new praise was given to the fact that an RPG of its scale had been successfully ported to the platform at all. Despite this, critics cited the graphical downgrade and lackluster implementation of 3D effects as detrimental factors, generally resulting in lower scores for the port when compared to the original game. At the 2011 Japan Game Awards, Xenoblade Chronicles received the Excellence award. In IGN's Best of 2012 awards, the game was named Best Wii Wii U Game and awarded with Best Wii Wii U Story . It was also nominated in the Best Overall Role playing Game and Best Overall Story categories. In RPGFan's Game of the Year awards that same year, it was named Best Traditional RPG , and was a runner up for Best Combat and Best RPG , losing both to Mass Effect 3. It was also awarded the site's Reader's Choice Best RPG award, with 24 of readers' votes going to Xenoblade Chronicles, beating Persona 4 Golden to the award. In RPGamer's Best of 2012 awards, it was named as the year's best RPG, along with earning awards for Best Story and Best Music . At the 2012 Golden Joystick Awards, the game was nominated in the Best RPG category, although it lost to The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. Slant Magazine named it as Game of the Year in 2012. During its opening week, Xenoblade Chronicles reached the top of Japan's gaming charts, selling 80,000 units. By the end of 2010, the game had sold over 161,000 copies, making it the eighth best selling Wii game of the year, and eventually reached almost 200,000 units by the end of 2013. In the UK charts, Xenoblade Chronicles debuted at 7, and reached 2 in the dedicated Wii charts despite stock shortages. According to Gamasutra, it was the fourth best selling game in the UK during its first week. In the US gaming charts, the game was excluded from the NPD Group's monthly assessment due to it being a retailer exclusive. Investment banking firm Piper Jaffray estimated it to be one of the best selling games in the United States during the month of April 2012, along with Mass Effect 3 and Prototype 2. In a later interview, it was stated that the game sold better in the West than in Japan. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D fared below par, selling merely 56,932 copies in its first week in Japan. Roughly 78,000 Japanese copies had been sold by the end of June 2015. In the UK charts, the game debuted at 27, becoming the third best selling Nintendo product of that week. According to NPD Group figures, the game sold under 75,000, failing to enter the top ten. However, Nintendo stated that the game was the fifth best selling platform exclusive that week. Shulk has been featured as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. crossover fighting game series, appearing in its Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Ultimate installments. Gaur Plain, a location in the game, appears as a stage, one of the games antagonists, Metal Face appears as a boss on said stage and Dunban, Fiora, and Riki accompany Shulk during his Final Smash. Additionally, Riki also appears as an assist trophy. Fiora was later featured as a playable character in the crossover game Project X Zone 2, representing the Xeno series alongside Xenosaga character KOS MOS, opposite Metal Face as an enemy character. By using experience gained during development of Xenoblade Chronicles and listening to feedback on the game, Takahashi and the team began work on a spiritual successor for the Wii U. Titled Xenoblade Chronicles X, it released worldwide in 2015. A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, was released worldwide in December 2017.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade%20Chronicles%20%28video%20game%29
"Xenogears is a role playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. The debut entry in the wider Xeno franchise, it was released in Japan in February 1998, and in North America in October the same year. The gameplay of Xenogears revolves around navigating 3D environments both on foot and using humanoid mecha dubbed Gears . Combat is governed by a version of the turn based Active Time Battle system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world to overthrow the all powerful rule of Solaris and uncover mysteries concerning their world. The story incorporates themes of Jungian psychology, Freudian thought, and religious symbolism. Created by Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Kaori Tanaka as a proposal for Final Fantasy VII, it was allowed to be developed as its own project, first as a sequel to Chrono Trigger and then as a wholly original game with a science fiction premise. It was developed under the working title Project Noah . The characters and mecha were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka, whose designs were portrayed during in game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team's general inexperience, the second half of the game's plot was primarily told through cutscenes. The game was nearly left unlocalized due to its religious content its localization was handled entirely by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career. The game received critical acclaim, with praise particularly going towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and psychological and religious themes, but received criticism for the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration. By 2003, the game had shipped over a million copies worldwide. It has since gained a cult following. While a direct sequel was never developed, Takahashi would later found Monolith Soft and develop the Xenosaga trilogy as a spiritual successor. Xenogears combines traditional role playing video game structures such as Square's signature Active Time Battle system with new features particular to the game's martial arts combat style. It features two slightly different battle systems in the first, the user controls human characters in turn based combat manipulated through the sequencing of learned combos. The second, making use of gears , introduces different sets of statistics and abilities for each character. Xenogears features both traditional anime and pre rendered CGI movie clips by Production I.G to illustrate important plot points. The player advances the protagonist and his companions through a three dimensional fictional world with visitable cities, geographical sites, and other important locations spread out across several continents. Some locations exist not on the original world map, but in the sky. At first, the party only travels on foot, but can eventually use a variety of vehicles, including their gears and the sand submarine Yggdrasil. Battle in Xenogears is a variant of the Active Time Battle system found in games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series. Most enemy encounters in Xenogears are random. When a battle begins, there is a transition to a separate screen with a combat interface. Player characters use a combination of martial arts moves, Ether magical attacks, and special Deathblow combinations, which are learned through the repetition of specific proportions of strong, moderate, and weak hits. All offensive actions use Action Points AP , costing either three points, two points, or one point, corresponding to the intensity of the attack. Each character can initially use only three AP per turn, but at higher levels, they can eventually use up to seven AP per turn. At a certain point in the game, characters can use Elemental Deathblows , which attach elemental attributes to physical combos. In addition to being used for attacks, AP may be saved and allocated to Attack Points for combo attacks during later turns. A total of 28 AP may be accumulated for combo attacks. Characters can also use a variety of magical abilities for both offense and ally support. These abilities are limited by the number of available Ether Points EP , which must be replenished using items during exploration non combat sequences. For most characters, these abilities are attributed to Ether, a mysterious power to which presumably all humans have access. Some characters' magical abilities are referred to by different names, implying differences in their origins. For example, Fei's magic is called Chi and Citan's is called Arcane . While fighting in gears, human Ether abilities are amplified, though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat. In addition to hand to hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within giant robots called gears. In gear combat, the limiting factor of AP is replaced by fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power. For these battles, deathblows may only be executed after first building up the Attack Level represented by a number in the bottom left of the gear combat interfacethrough the execution of strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an infinite level with its own set of deathblows. To reach Infinity Mode , a character must stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to Infinity attacks. Gears can regain fuel with a Charge command. The gears can also activate Boosters which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn. The Special Option command allows for gear HP restoration abilities and special, fuel consuming attacks. When a gear has no fuel left, it can no longer execute attacks, use special options, or use boosters. They can, however, Charge to regain fuel and use Ether abilities. Gear fuel, parts, and upgrades may be purchased in shops or from certain individual vendors. Xenogears initially takes place on Ignas, the largest continent of the Xenogears world and the site of a centuries long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. A church like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears giant robot suits for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to assist Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris. Much of the Xenogears plot and backstory is detailed in the Japanese only book Xenogears Perfect Works. Produced by the now defunct DigiCube, it details the history of the Xenogears universe from the discovery of the Zohar to the start of the game. According to the Perfect Works schematic as well as the game's end credits , Xenogears is the fifth episode in a series of six, with events spanning multiple millennia. Xenogears' nine playable characters hail from different areas of the game's world. The game begins on Ignas, a continent with two countries, Aveh and Kislev. Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land, although it is later learned that they originate from the capital cities Aphel Aura and Etrenank of the floating countries of Shevat and Solaris, respectively. Fei is the story's protagonist, and has initially lost his memories of his past. Citan is a man whose knowledge of the world and technology often aids in the party's quest. Bart, a desert pirate, is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh. Rico, a demi human with incredible strength, lives in a Kislev prison, spending his days as a gear battling champion. Solaris, a hidden city of advanced technology, is home to several characters in the game. Billy, a pious worker for the Ethos religious group, was originally from Solaris. Elly, a beautiful Gebler officer of Solaris, is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him by the end of the game. Maria and Chu Chu are both from Shevat, the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris' domination. Emeralda is a humanoid being constructed by an ancient civilization from a colony of nanomachines, and was retrieved from the ruins of the ancient civilization Zeboim. Significant non playable characters include Krelian and Miang, both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus, a mechanical weapon that fell to earth thousands of years ago. They serve as the game's main antagonists. Grahf, a mysterious man with immense power, serves as a major antagonist he follows Fei and his group and often fights them, though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game. As being the Contact, the Anti type and the Complement, Fei, Elly, and Miang have been reincarnated several times throughout the game's history. Xenogears centers around the protagonist Fei Fong Wong, an adopted young male in the village of Lahan, brought by a mysterious masked man three years ago. The events surrounding Fei's arrival at the village cause him to have retrograde amnesia. During an attack on Lahan from Gebler, Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy, accidentally destroying the village. As a result, Fei and Citan, the village's doctor, leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village. Fei meets Elly, a Gebler officer, and Grahf, who claims to know about Fei's past and admits to spearheading the attack on Lahan to unlock Fei's abilities. Eventually, Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart, a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh. Fei again loses control of himself inside his gear while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear. Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman, a mysterious masked man, who originally brought Fei to Lahan. Fei is able to escape with the help of his friends, including a new one, prisoner Rico, but he and Elly are separated from the rest of the party and accidentally shot down by Bart. They are rescued by the Thames, a mobile floating city. After learning Elly's whereabouts, Gebler attacks Thames to kidnap Elly and Miang, a Gebler officer, unsuccessfully attempts to brainwash her. Gebler leader Ramsus, who holds a vendetta against Fei, attacks Thames, searching for him. Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos' advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos' leader, reveals to the party Ethos's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or Lambs , for Solaris. The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of nanomachines, which is what Solarian leader Krelian seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear's pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman. The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of anterograde amnesia. Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris, joined by Shevat locals Maria and Chu Chu. During this time, Bart regains his throne and initiates peace between the two countries and Stone is destroyed. Upon entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the nanomachine colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as Kim , much to Fei's confusion. In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain, though he's actually a double agent on their side, and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of recycled humans in the Soylent System facility. The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive God and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei's split personality, with Fei's gear turning red when he switches to Id due to their connection. The Gazel Ministry uses the Gaetia Key, an artifact that manipulates the DNA of massive amounts of humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all powerful Gear called Deus that crash landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other and learn that they are the reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan around the time of the war between Shevat and Solaris five hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the Mother, who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existencean extra dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gearsand learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated. Fei discovers that he is a descendant of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled. Deus, however, had become self aware and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus' power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel's longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion. When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus. One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. Ramsus, revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of Emperor Cain created by Solaris scientists as a means of controlling Deus who was rejected in favor of Fei, hence his hatred of the latter, attacks one more time and is finally defeated. He is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid the group. Fei sets out to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy released from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move it away from the planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpentine incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plane of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite with the rest of the party. Xenogears was produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, who previously worked on the SNES game Secret of Mana. The scenario of the game was written by director Tetsuya Takahashi and by Kaori Tanaka. Yasuyuki Honne served as art director, while Kunihiko Tanaka was responsible for the character designs. Tetsuo Mizuno, Tomoyuki Takechi, and Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi were executive producers for Xenogears. Koichi Mashimo, an animation director and his studio Bee Train, was in charge of the anime cut scenes. Xenogears started out as an early concept conceived by Tetsuya Takahashi and Kaori Tanaka for the Square game Final Fantasy VII. Their superior in the company deemed it too dark and complicated for a fantasy , but Takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project. The project began under the working title Project Noah . The main impetus for Takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with the Final Fantasy series. The initial concept was to make Xenogears a sequel to Chrono Trigger, but after multiple clashes with the company over this and unspecified practical difficulties, it was decided to make it a completely original title. Due to this initial development idea, there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world, so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into the game's world. Development took approximately two years, and included a staff of thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that. The word Xeno had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being something strange or alien . Gears was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game's Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreate Tanaka's Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas. Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation's capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds. The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around where do we come from, what are we, where are we going . There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game. The game's second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party's escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two year development time, so instead of ending prematurely with the end of the first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc's content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines. Square had announced that Xenogears may not have come out in the United States due to sensitive religious issues . The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of killing God , which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said yabeh o , a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name. Square Enix released Xenogears on the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25, 2008 and in North America on February 22, 2011. The music in Xenogears was composed, arranged, and produced by Yasunori Mitsuda, his first major project since the 1995 Super NES title, Chrono Trigger. The Xenogears Original Soundtrack was released on two discs and published by DigiCube in Japan in 1998. The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a choral track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from a world of own imagining rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. There are two vocal tracks included on the OST, and both are sung by Joanne Hogg. One of the tracks, Stars of Tears , did not appear in the final version of the game. It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits. The scene, however, was removed for pacing issues, as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes. The other, Small Two of Pieces Screeching Shards , was the first ending theme with lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square. An arranged soundtrack of Xenogears also composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as Creid. For Creid, he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in easy to listen to pop tracks to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks. The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks, while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the title track, which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording. Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in Creid. Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while Eimear Quinn sang Creid . Myth The Xenogears Orchestral Album, an album of music from the game arranged orchestrally by Mitsuda's own music company Procyon Studio, was released on CD and vinyl in February 2011. A Blu ray album entitled Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc the first and the last was released in Japan on April 4, 2018. The album is a remaster of the original soundtrack, plus outtakes and other content. A 20th anniversary concert was held in Tokyo, Japan on April 7 and 8, 2018. There have been several Japanese books and comics published concerning the Xenogears franchise. Xenogears God Slaying Story, a series by Masatoshi Kusakabe, was published by Shueisha in 1998. DigiCube published both Xenogears Perfect Works and a memorial album named Thousands of Daggers, which contains the entire script to the game in Japanese, along with screenshots. Two manga books, Xenogears Comic Anthology and Xenogears 4koma Comic, were released by Movic. Movic also released wallscrolls, notebooks, pins, keychains, stickers, and postcards depicting the Xenogears cast. Xenogears was a commercial success in both Japan and North America. It received a Gold Prize from Sony in May 1998, indicating sales above 500,000 units in Japan, and proceeded to sell over 890,000 copies domestically by the end of the year. As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 1.19 million copies worldwide, with 910,000 of those copies being shipped in Japan and 280,000 abroad. As a result of these sales, it was re released as a Greatest Hits title in December 2003. In Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Xenogears was voted the 16th best video game of all time by its readers in a poll held in 2006. On a similar poll at GameFAQs, users of the website voted Xenogears the 32nd Best Game Ever in 2005. It was placed in the same position in IGN's Top 100 Games Readers Choice feature in 2006, and as number 28 in 2008. Xenogears was met with critical acclaim. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the story, characters, gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack. IGN described it as the hands down best RPG of the year, praising the storyline, gameplay, graphics, presentation, and soundtrack. GameSpot described it as one of Squaresoft's best role playing games, praising the story, gameplay, and audio, but criticized the lack of graphical polish. Allgame pointed out in a positive light that the character battles are unlike most role playing games from this company . Retrospectively, Edge commented that although it is considered by some to be a multimillion yen, convoluted science fiction vanity project, Xenogears nevertheless remains one of the most keenly eulogized PlayStation RPGs. The magazine also noted that it was Takahashi's most challenging and pure work and that the Xenosaga series never quite matched up to Xenogears. The game's story and characters were well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly said it is rich in story and character development. Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot was one of the game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it a game every RPG fanatic must play. IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, deep, complex, and once in a while even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered. GameSpot said the story is excellent and thought provoking but said it can be a little preachy at times , but went on to say that the religious and existential themes enhance the story and understanding of the game's deep characterizations . Game Revolution described the storyline as epic and fabulous with many twists and turns and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG , giving it a 99 rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the most complicated Freudian hero in video games, but said it has a flawed script and muddied translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot one of the wackiest game plotlines ever , but said that it actually makes sense if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game. Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game, giving it a 100 rating for the story. Reviewers largely praised Xenogears' gameplay. Next Generation praised Square's Active Time Battle gauge and said that inclusion of the AP meter and combo attacks is not only refreshing in a turn based RPG, but gives players a higher level of interaction during battle. IGN claimed that the most impressive feature in combat is the ability to use massive Gears or mechs , noting that Square's attention to programming these battles is made evident by how visually satisfying they are. IGN praised the game's exploration, saying that the ability to jump and climb adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances Xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional RPG , the only complaint being that the rotating camera is sometimes clumsy . The soundtrack was well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly said the game sounds as beautiful as it looks. GameSpot said it expertly uses audio to push the story along and noted that many of the games' tracks include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game's mood , but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making the game's soundtrack a tad sparse. Xenogears was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes. Electronic Gaming Monthly said they are some of the slickest animation cinemas they have seen. Game Revolution praised the absolutely spectacular and stunning hand drawn anime cut scenes, but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting. Shortly after Xenogears was released, there was speculation of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka said that a project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel when it was first announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel . Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears. On the connection between Xenogears and Xenosaga, Takahashi has stated It's probably more suitable to say that it follows the direction and style of Xenogears. ... Now that we are under a different company, we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again. Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in Xenosaga, others are more like self parodies, so we don't really want Xenogears fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that. Several members of the Xenogears staff came together in 2008 to work on Sands of Destruction, a role playing game published by Sega for the Nintendo DS. These staff members include Masato Kato, Kunihiko Tanaka, and Yasunori Mitsuda. In 2017, gears from the game, along with avatars of Fei and Bart, were included as pre order cosmetic bonuses in Square Enix's mecha shooting game, Figureheads.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenogears
"The Xenogears Original Soundtrack is the official soundtrack to Square's role playing video game Xenogears. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and contains 44 tracks, including a Bulgarian choral song and two pieces performed by the Irish singer Joanne Hogg. Though the game was released in both Japan and North America, the album was published in Japan exclusively as a two CD set on March 1, 1998. The soundtrack was composed with strong traditional and Irish music influences, while the lyrics for the vocal tracks were written by the game's director Tetsuya Takahashi and its scenario writer Masato Kato. The soundtrack reached 55 in Japan and was generally well received by critics, though some disagreed on whether the album can be fully appreciated by non players. Two arranged versions of the soundtrack, Creid 1998 and Myth The Xenogears Orchestral Album 2011 , were also released by Mitsuda. A remastered version of the original album, Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc the first and the last 2018 , was released by Square Enix along with a pair of concerts. The composer, along with Joanne Hogg, reprised their roles for the soundtrack to Xenogears's spiritual prequel Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht in 2002. Tribute albums were also produced by fans. Xenogears entered development in 1996 and was released in 1998. The game's soundtrack was Yasunori Mitsuda's first major solo work, as his previous soundtracks were collaborations with other composers with the exception of the score to Radical Dreamers Nusumenai Hoseki, which never saw an album release. Mitsuda worked closely with Masato Kato, the event planner and script writer of Xenogears, to compose the score. Mitsuda considered it hard at times to maintain his motivation throughout the whole two year period, especially since he had to wait for the end to see the most dramatic tracks implemented. The game's director Tetsuya Takahashi did not initially think music was all that important compared to graphics, but eventually acknowledged its importance when he realized it could strongly enhance the expressivity of the images. Takahashi explained that without Mitsuda's music, he would not have been able to achieve his goals for the project. The development team wanted to have a Western singer contribute to the score. Mitsuda initially had difficulties finding an artist that matched his vision, but eventually chose Joanne Hogg from the Celtic band Iona after stumbling upon their album The Book of Kells in a CD store and listening to the song Chi Rho . Hogg was enthusiastic in contributing as it was her first video game related recording. She did not play the game for the project, however. Irish music was not well known in Japan at the time, but Mitsuda felt that a Celtic boom was about to hit the country. His prediction would later turn true with the popularity of the American film Titanic and the Irish stepdancing show Riverdance. Stars of Tears , one of the songs included on the soundtrack album, did not appear in the final version of the game. It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits. The scene, however, was removed for pacing issues, as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes. Another song on the soundtrack, Small Two of Pieces Screeching Shards , was the first ending theme with sung lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square. The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a choral track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from a world of own imagining rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. Mitsuda felt that composing for the game was very difficult due to the unfamiliarity of most Japanese with foreign traditionals, but expressed his wish for listeners of the soundtrack to open up to music from all over the world. His musical approach was to insert Celtic influences into easy to listen to pop tracks, rather than making either dense Celtic music or simple background music. Other influences on the soundtrack include Arabic music on the desert town theme Dazil, Town of Scorching Sands , and religious music, in keeping with the game's storyline. Mitsuda explained that he wanted music that felt religious, but from a different angle . The opening movie of the game was produced before the corresponding track Dark Dawn was, and Mitsuda had to rearrange his composition after realizing some parts were out of synch with the frames by about a minute and a half. The choral track, titled The Beginning and the End , was performed by a 41 voice choir named The Great Voices of Bulgaria and features lyrics written by Tetsuya Takahashi. His lyrics were translated from Japanese to English then to Bulgarian for the recording. Joanne Hogg sang in English on Stars of Tears and Small Two of Pieces Screeching Shards . The latter took Mitsuda an awfully long amount of time just to compose the demo version. Masato Kato wrote the original lyrics for the two songs, and Hogg arranged them so that they would fit the melodies better and sound more Celtic. As with most of his previous soundtracks, Mitsuda composed a musical box arrangement of one of the main themes in Xenogears' case, the track Distant Promise is the musical box version of Small Two of Pieces . The instrumental tracks of the score were programmed with the PlayStation sound module in Tokyo, Japan, while The Beginning and the End was recorded live in Sofia, Bulgaria. Hogg's songs were recorded in two days in Dublin, Ireland in 1996 they featured the Riverdance musician Davy Spillane on low whistle. When Titanic premiered in November 1997, Mitsuda noticed coincidental similarities between the film's ending song, Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On , and the Irish themed music he was composing for Xenogears. He felt irritated and devoted himself to complete the soundtrack's recording before Titanic came out. As with some of his previous soundtracks, Mitsuda would stay in the Japanese studio for long amounts of time and regularly fall asleep from overwork, while some melodies would first come to him in his dreams, such as that of Ties of Sea and Flames . The composer collapsed during the soundtrack mastering process due to exhaustion, and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The score involved in total nearly a hundred people. At one point, the music staff considered adding sound effects and voice narrations into the soundtrack album, but the idea was scrapped in favour of normal renditions of the game's music. The album reached 55 on the Japan Oricon charts. Soundtrack Central felt that Mitsuda created a masterpiece in Xenogears , while RPGFan thought it was most certainly his greatest achievement . On the other hand, one reviewer on Square Enix Music Online unrelated to Square Enix felt it did not represent Mitsuda's best album, saying that what was an amazing soundtrack in its day ... has stood the test of time very well. Reviewers disagreed whether the album could only be enjoyed by Xenogears players, or if it could be appreciated by a wider audience. Several reviewers noted the diversity of styles present in the score. Soundtrack Central thought it was a superb mix of epic adventure and traditional themes , while Square Enix Music Online appreciated the melding of futuristic, ethnic and religious themes, feeling that the recurring chanting sound effects made everything sound coherent. Critics also noticed similarities between some melodies and Mitsuda's previous work Chrono Trigger, though reviewers felt that those of Xenogears were more widely based and had a distinctive Celtic sound. The reviewers also praised the sound system used for the instrumental tracks as being up to the highest standard for the PlayStation console. The emotional tracks were considered the strongest part of the score, and were praised for their ability to musically reflect the various locales and characters seen in the game. The opening track Dark Dawn was similarly lauded for showcasing all the influences of the soundtrack in a single composition. The battle themes were described as a weaker area and were called either effective or repetitive, with Square Enix Music Online noting that Mitsuda has never been very good at composing interesting battle tracks . The final boss theme The One Who Bares Fangs at God received the most diverse comments, ranging from praises to criticism, due to its reliance on synth choral sound effects rather than a clear melody. The ending song Small Two of Pieces was received positively and, as Mitsuda predicted, compared to My Heart Will Go On . While in Ireland, Mitsuda also worked with Spillane and Maire Breatnach, another musician from Riverdance, to record an arranged album of Xenogears. Titled Creid and released in April 1998, the arranged album features 10 instrumental and vocal tracks from the soundtrack arranged in a more dominant Celtic style. Stars of Tears and Small Two of Pieces appear on the album as Two Wings and Mobius respectively, and are sung in Japanese by Tetsuko Techie Honma. A second arranged album, titled Myth The Xenogears Orchestral Album, was released on February 23, 2011. The original soundtrack versions of Stars of Tears and Small Two of Pieces were featured on the 2001 compilation Square Vocal Collection, and again in 2009 on the compilation Colours of Light. The Xenogears soundtrack remains one of Mitsuda's favourite projects, and one of the works that he continues to feel a special connection to. For the game's 20th anniversary, a remastered version of the soundtrack titled Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc the first and the last was released on blu ray on April 4, 2018. The remasters were overseen by Mitsuda, and the album contains a new arranged track by Mitsuda featuring a vocal performance by Irish choral ensemble Anuna. Contemporaneous with the album release, a concert of music titled Xenogears 20th Anniversary Concert The Beginning and the End was performed by the Xenogears Concert Special Band Orchestra, Joanne Hogg, and Anuna on April 6 and 7 at the Maihama Amphitheater in Urayasu, Japan. In 2002, Mitsuda composed the score to Monolith Soft's Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht, the spiritual prequel to Xenogears, also directed by Tetsuya Takahashi. Joanne Hogg returned to sing the soundtrack's vocal themes, while the instrumental tracks were performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Monolith Soft did not ask Mitsuda and Hogg to reprise their roles for Episode II and Episode III, however. A tribute album titled Xenogears Light An Arranged Album, was published in limited quantities by the fan group OneUp Studios in 2005. The album features 20 tracks arranged from the Xenogears score and performed with acoustic instruments, such as piano, flute, guitar and violin. Another, unofficial album of remixes titled Humans Gears was produced as a digital album by OverClocked Remix on October 19, 2009 consisting of 33 tracks on two discs .

"Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht is a role playing video game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Namco for the PlayStation 2 the game was released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. It is the first entry in the Xenosaga trilogy, and forms part of the wider Xeno metaseries. Gameplay features exploration of environments through a linear narrative, while battles use turn based combat with the player characters fighting both on foot and piloting large mecha dubbed A.G.W.S. combat in turn features a system of button combinations for attack types, and multiple leveling systems. Set far in the future when humanity has left Earth, the plot follows Shion Uzuki, an employee of Vector Industries and KOS MOS, a battle android design to fight the hostile alien Gnosis. Forced to escape a Gnosis attack and head for the planet of Second Miltia, Shion and KOS MOS are pulled into a fight between the Galaxy Federation and the hostile U TIC Organization. With others who join them as they head to safety, they face a deeper mystery surrounding U TIC's goals and the plans of the immortal Albedo Piazzolla. Development began in 2000 under the codename Project X following the founding of Monolith Soft. Intended as a spiritual successor to the 1998 video game Xenogears, multiple staff were carried over including director and co writer Tetsuya Takahashi, co writer Soraya Saga, character designer Kunihiko Tanaka, and composer Yasunori Mitsuda. The game received generally positive reviews from critics and sold over one million copies worldwide. Its direct sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was released in 2004 in Japan and 2005 overseas. The final Xenosaga game, Xenosaga Episode III, was released in 2006. The game received an anime adaptation which aired in 2005, and was re imagined along with Episode II as part of Xenosaga I II for the Nintendo DS. Xenosaga Episode I is a role playing video game the player controls a party of characters, navigating them through a variety of environments tied to the progression of the story. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences told mainly through traditional full motion cutscenes. Exploring environments, the party can collect a variety of items, some of which can be used in gameplay to boost a character's statistics or restore health. During the course of the game, a database is unlocked that documents the game's story events and terminology. The player can access several mini game plug in systems through Shion's portable console, and an e mail system that allows players to make playful decisions that have little significance to the main plot. The console can also be used to access to cleared areas of the game these grant access to side quests separate from the main storyline. While navigating environments, enemies are visible within the environment, with engagement being optional. If the player chooses to engage, some environmental elements such as combustible objects can be used to alter an enemy's statistics and grand the player an advantage in battle. When battle begins, the three character player party and the enemy party fight in a dedicated combat arena. The combat is governed by a turn based battle system. Each character has access to melee and ranged standard attacks, can use items to affect the party or enemies, and guard against attacks. The player party's attacks are determined through button combinations, with different combinations triggering different attack sequences that can have secondary effects on the party and neighboring enemies. Attack combinations can be customized by the player between battles. Each attack uses Action Points AP , with AP remaining after each turn carried over to the next turn. Special moves for each character are unlocked by building up AP over several turns. When a minimum of three AP are available, a character can perform an exclusive action which deals high damage to their opponent. More powerful attacks can be performed with higher amounts of AP. In addition, characters can perform Ether moves, powerful attacks and support actions which drain their Ether Points EP . Both player and some enemy party members also have a Boost meter, which when full allows that character to perform an additional action while taking away an opponent's turn. The party has access to mecha, which can be equipped by surrendering a turn. Mecha have their own set of moves and boast more powerful attacks than the main party, but also carry over damage between battles. Following the victory, the party is awarded with in game currency which can be used to purchase items and accessories at shops. The party is also awarded experience points which raise a character's experience level, along with a variety of skill points. These are divided into EP to fuel Ether abilities, along with Skill Points SP and Tech Points TP . SP are assigned to activate passive effects drawn from different accessories, while Tech Points raise the effectiveness and power of Tech attacks unlocked as the character's experience level rises. Xenosaga Episode I takes place in a universe based around science fiction. In the year 20XX , the Zoharan artifact dating from the beginning of the universe which connects to the realm of a god like energy dubbed U DOwas unearthed by an archeological expedition in Kenya the Zohar is key to enabling humanity to travel in space beyond the Solar System. Over 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth behind to colonize the galaxy following a terrible event, resulting in Earth's location being lost and the planet being dubbed Lost Jerusalem by the game's events, humanity has adopted a new calendar system dubbed Transcend Christ T.C. , with the game's events taking place in T.C. 4767equivalent to A.D. 7277. Humanity is now spread across 500,000 planets, with their governments forming the Galaxy Federation. Planets are connected through a time warp travel network called the Unus Mundus Network U.M.N. . The U.M.N. is managed by Vector Industries, which also controls interests in the Federations military. Existing alongside humans are Realians, synthetic humans who hold equal status with natural humans. The Federation has come under attack from the ancient alien Gnosis, which begin decimating Federation worlds. As normal weapons are ineffective against them, Vector develops two different weapon systems designed to fight them humanoid mecha dubbed A.G.W.S. Anti Gnosis Weapon System , and the similar but more powerful KOS MOS battle androids. Another hostile faction is the U TIC Organization, a once scientific group that now wishes to gain control of the Zohar. A key episode in the game's backstory is the Miltian Conflict, a war between U TIC and the Federation which triggered the Gnosis' arrival and caused Miltia to be swallowed in a space time anomaly. The main characters are Shion Uzuki, a human scientist employed by Vector Industries, and her creation the prototype anti Gnosis battle android KOS MOS. She is assisted on the project by Allen Ridgeley, and during her time on the Federation ship Woglinde interacts with Federation officers Andrew Cherenkov and Luis Virgil. As the story progresses, Shion and KOS MOS meet the crew of the passenger freighter Elsa, a ship associated with the Kukai Foundation run by Gaignun Kukai and Jr. , the latter captaining the Durandal both Gaignun and Jr. are artificial beings dubbed U.R.T.Vs, with Jr.'s gifts meaning his body has not aged beyond childhood. Among the crew of the Elsa is chaos, a melancholy young man with a mysterious past. The group are joined by the cyborg Ziggyshort for Ziggurat 8 and the prototype Realian MOMO. The main antagonists are Margulis, the leader of the U TIC Organization and Albedo Piazzolla, Jr. and Gaignun's brother. Events are monitored by Wilheim, CEO of Vector and Nephilim, a young girl connected to the Zohar. Shion is running final tests on KOS MOS aboard the Woglinde when the crew retrieve a Zohar Emulator, one of thirteen replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors Shion's progress, but is also a U TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS MOS self activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and Allen. KOS MOS brings them and Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned about KOS MOS's behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's emotional state. Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U TIC, as data stored inside her could open the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in a disaster for which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed. Ziggy rescues MOMO and narrowly escapes, fending off attacks by Margulis. Albedo, who is working with U TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO. The Elsa is pulled out of hyperspace and swallowed by a giant Gnosis. During their attempts to escape Cherenkov transforms into a Gnosis. The group are forced to kill the transformed Cherenkov before escaping on the Elsa and being rescued by Jr.. During the subsequent battle, KOS MOS activates previously unseen weaponry and absorbs the attacking Gnosis. While traveling with Jr., the group learn that the Kukai Foundation are gathering and storing the Zohar Emulators created by Mizrahi. Meanwhile, U TIC uses agents within the Federation to doctor footage of Jr.'s battle with U TIC and implicate the group in the destruction of the Woglinde. The group travel to the Kukai Foundation base above Second Miltia, operated by Jr.'s brother Gaignun. They are subsequently held hostage by Federation troops due to U TIC's influence. With help from an ally of Gaignun, the group retrieve evidence from within KOS MOS's memory center which can exonerate them. While inside KOS MOS's memory, the group are guided through a dream like realm constructed from their repressed bad memories, all the way observed by Nephilim, with whom chaos is acquainted. Shion also meets a vision of Febronia, a Realian woman killed in the Miltian Conflict, who asks Shion to free her sisters Cecily and Cathe for the sake of both humans and Realians. Before fulfilling their mission, Nephilim tells them that KOS MOS was designed to stop the energies of U DO from entering their reality, an event which caused the original planet Miltia to vanish into a space time void and could potentially destroy the universe. Due to surviving a Gnosis encounter and remaining human, Shion has the capacity to change the future for the better. During these events, Albedo captures and psychologically tortures MOMO before triggering the Song of Nephilim , a song which attracts swarms of Gnosis. The Federation fleet try to destroy the Kukai base as it appears to be the source of the Song, but Wilhelmwho has been secretly observing eventsarrives with a private fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape with a piece of data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue cloaked manrevealed to be a resurrected Virgilobserves events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self destructs, KOS MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere. Xenosaga Episode I was the debut game title of Japanese developer Monolith Soft. Company founder Tetsuya Takahashi acted as director and co writer. Takahashi had previously worked at Square on the PlayStation RPG Xenogears. Initially planned as a six part series and despite there being concept work for a sequel, Xenogears was left as a standalone project while Square decided to focus on their established franchises such as Final Fantasy. Another stated reason was that Square said they did not have the money available to invest in his concept. Following his departure from Square due to disagreeing with their strategy, Takahashi searched for another company which could help him create the game he and others from the Xenogears project envisioned. According to producer Hirohide Sugiura, most of the companies they contacted suggested forming Monolith Soft as an independent developer, with only Namco suggesting that they become a subsidiary, and was willing to both fund the production and manage the logistics and marketing, allowing Monolith Soft staff to focus solely on creating the game. Following this agreement, Namco helped in the development and marketing of the game. While production of the game began following the foundation of Monolith Soft in 2000, Takahashi had been working on the game's concept since 1999, intending it as a spiritual successor to Xenogears rather than a remake or sequel. Production at Monolith Soft took two years. The development budget apparently reached 1 billionapproximately 7,700,000 USD. Xenosaga Episode I was developed by a core team of between 60 and 80 people, expanding to over 100 people at its most active development period. Among the staff, twenty of them had previously worked on Xenogears. The biggest issue faced when building the team was that they were developing for the PlayStation 2, a console with far more power than any previous console they had worked on. A major improvement in Takahashi's view over his work on Xenogears was that he was able to make the entire game using 3D graphics, something he had been unable to do with Xenogears. Due to the amount of preparatory work and getting accustomed to the new hardware, actual development did not start until 2000, lasting approximately a year. Namco provided development support with the motion capture technology. Takahashi later noted that the sheer number of young and inexperienced developers in Monolith Soft negative impacted development, with the graphics engine being completed only six months before the game's release. Prior to its announcement, the game was developed under the working title Project X . Character designs were cooperatively handled by Kunihiko Tanaka and Kouichi Mugitani, while mecha designs were handled by Mugitani and Junya Ishigaki. Mugitani also worked on the game as production designer. The art director was Yasuyuki Honne, who had previously worked on both Xenogears and Chrono Cross, while character motion was handled by Norihiro Takami. Honne collaborated with Takami in creating the character motions for cutscenes. When creating the designs, Tanaka was given an outline of a character by Takahashi in addition to comparisons with real life actors, and then created the designs from that. Tanaka's art stylewhich gave characters large eyes dominating their facesprovided a challenge for the team as Takahashi wanted to be as close to the original artwork as possible, but the expressive power of the large eyed facial design could easily be destroyed by the wrong lighting. Takami worked hard on character models to make sure the large eye styling was preserved without upsetting the model's balance. Mugitani and Ishigaki respectively handled the designs for Vector staff and the Federation. KOS MOS was initially designed by Tanaka, but he had considerable trouble finalizing her design. Mugitani then contributed, creating something close to KOS MOS's final design, which was then polished by Tanaka. Tanaka also had difficulty creating Shion's design, giving her glasses as an easy way of showing her personality. The scenario for Episode I was co written by Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. To ensure development of the game remained focused, Takahashi consulted the entire staff on the script's direction before the main production began. Takahashi initially planned Xenosaga to span six games, with a narrative divided into three parts all featuring the dual figures of KOS MOS and chaos. The character of KOS MOS was created by Takahashi. While human characters created by Takahashi and Saga were typically shown as strong despite having fragile bodies, KOS MOS was designed to be the opposite an unbreakable person with a fragile spirit. The names of KOS MOS and chaos were deliberate plays on the philosophical concepts of order and chaos in the universe, tying into elements of Zen incorporated into the world structure. The game made heavy use of Biblical mythology, a trait shared with later entries in the series. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of The Will to Power, a collection of notes by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series within the context of Episode I, the subtitle directly reflects the game's characters and the strength of their will. The Federation's military structure was based on the United States Army with some elements from the Imperial Japanese Army mixed in. In addition to references to Nietzsche, Takahashi incorporated references to Richard Wagner such as the ship name Woglinde due to Wagner's historic association with Nietzsche. Xenosaga Episode I was first announced in June 2001, scheduled for release later that year. In September of that year, it was confirmed that the game had been delayed into February the following year. The game was released in Japan on February 28, 2002. In an interview, Takahashi confirmed that Western localization would begin following the game's Japanese release. The game was localized for the West by Interone Inc, with English dubbing handled by ZRO Limit Productions and Animaze. The localization process took over a year. While all blood, gore, religious references and adult language were retained in the Western release, one scene between the adult Albedo and the childlike MOMO had its more erotic elements toned down for the Western release. The game released in North America on February 25, 2003. This version, with the English voice work and additional costumes and bonus features, was later released in Japan under the title Xenosaga Episode I Reloaded on November 20, 2003. The music was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had previously worked with Takahashi on the score of Xenogears. Mitsuda worked as both composer and orchestrator. Mitsuda was almost unable to collaborate on the project due to a tight schedule, but they were able to bring him in. As opposed to most RPG scores at the time, Mitsuda collaborated with Takahashi to create tracks for specific scenes in the game rather than a smaller number of repeating tracks. Due to the game's religious references, the score incorporated Gregorian chants. The score was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Multiple soundtrack albums were released, first from DigiCube and later through Mitsuda's own label Sleigh Bells. A single was released for the game's theme song Kokoro . Xenosaga Episode I reached the top of sales charts, selling over 240,000 units within three days of its release. By the end of the year, the game was the seventh best selling game of 2002, with sales of near 340,000 units. While no exact figures were given, Namco reported that Episode I was one of their games that had seen commercial success internationally. In July 2003, Namco announced that the game had sold over one million copies worldwide. Japanese magazine Famitsu positively noted the world and character development, while GamePro stated that the story and characters that of a good, hard, science fiction novel or the best anime series available . Greg Kasavin of GameSpot enjoyed the narrative, but felt that the Biblical elements were only there for shock value rather than being meaningful additions. Christian Nutt of GameSpy felt that the strong characters helped support the narrative. IGN's Jeremy Dunham was highly positive about the story and the development of characters, but noted that some might be dissatisfied with the unresolved story elements held over to later games. Jake Alley of RPGamer called the story interesting , while Eurogamer's Rob Fahey praised the complexity and depth of the narrative. Multiple journalists noted the high number and length of cutscenes, with some enjoying them while others felt there were too many. GamePro noted that the game was enjoyable despite it appearing convoluted at first, even for RPG . Kasavin appreciated the lack of random encounters and enjoyed the strategic flow of battle, while Nutt appreciated both the game's challenge and its deep mechanics. Dunham praised both the ease of gameplay following its introductory stages and the customization options available. He was less positive about most of the mini games available. Fahay felt that the game had excellent gameplay, and like Sasavin praised the removal of random encounters. The A.G.W.S. mechs were seen by several reviewers as a lackluster addition to the gameplay. The mechanic used to enable the player to revisit dungeons was also frequently seen as contrived. Kasavin called Episode I a great looking game despite some lip synching issues, and praised the cinematography and graphics used in cinematics. Nutt called the environments pure visual pleasure and the character models both varied and uniformly excellent . Dunham praised the cinematography and gave particular praise to the animations of facial movements and expressions. Fahay, while generally finding the graphics excellent, praised the merging of cinematic and real time graphics to create a smooth experience while playing the game. The music was generally praised by reviewers, although Kasavin and Alley felt that it was too scarce during gameplay segments. The English voice earned contrasting opinions from reviewers while Alley and Nutt gave praise to the English cast, Dunham and Kasavin were less impressed by the overall performances, with Dunham comparing the dub to an average dub of a Japanese anime. The international success of Xenosaga Episode I prompted Namco to offer then more support, with Namco's then Vice President Yoichi Haraguchi to name the company as a valuable development partner alongside Namco Tales Studio. A manga adaptation was written by Atsushi Baba and published through Monthly Comic Zero Sum. The manga was released by the comic's publisher Ichijinsha across three volumes between 2004 and 2006. Following the release of Episode I, a supplementary disc was created titled Xenosaga Freaks. Released on April 28, 2004, Freaks is split into four segments a visual novel segment featuring multiple characters from the game, a minigame dubbed XenoPitten, a dictionary that explains the game's terminology, and a demo for the game's official sequel. Freaks was part of a movement with the Xenosaga series to turn it into a multimedia franchise, with the project growing substantially larger than previously planned. The sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was developed by a new team with Takahashi overseeing the project so the series could be taken in a new direction by younger staff members within Monolith Soft. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka based on the initial draft by Takahashi and Saga, ended up leaving out a lot of the originally planned content. Episode II was released in Japan in June 2004, while it was released in North America in February 2005. The sequel was also published in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in October of that year. Both Episode I and Episode II were re imagined for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I II, released in March 2006. Co developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I II remains exclusive to Japan. Development of Xenosaga Episode III began while work was finishing on Episode II. While the team were open to further entries based on the game's commercial performance, it was designed to be the last entry in the series. Arai and Yonesaka returned respectively as director and scriptwriter. Takahashi provided the scenario draft and supervised the writing. Episode III released in 2006 in Japan and North America. Episode III was the last game released in the Xenosaga series. Following the success of the game, a twelve episode anime adaptation titled Xenosaga The Animation was produced by Toei Animation while no staff from the game were involved in the anime's production, the staff wanted to keep the anime as close to the game's events as possible. First announced in 2004, the anime was first transmitted on TV Asahi between January and March 2005. The anime was first licensed and dubbed by A.D. Vision. The license was later picked up by Funimation Entertainment. Multiple staff from Xenosaga The Animation would later take part in the production of Xenosaga I II.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga%20Episode%20I
"Xenosaga Episode II Jenseits von Gut und Bose is a role playing video game developed by Monolith Soft for the PlayStation 2. It was published in Japan 2004 and North America 2005 by Namco, and in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe 2005 . It is the second entry in the Xenosaga trilogy, and forms part of the wider Xeno metaseries. Continuing directly from the events of Xenosaga Episode I, Xenosaga Episode II sees protagonists Shion Uzuki and Jr. continuing to combat the plots of the U TIC Organization and the insane Albedo Piazzolla. Gameplay is carried over from the first game, featuring exploration of environments through a linear narrative, while battles follow a turn based system featuring a system of button combinations, multiple leveling systems, and combat featuring both the characters on foot and piloting large mecha called E.S. . Development of Xenosaga Episode II began following the completion of Episode I. Series creator Tetsuya Takahashi gave control of the Xenosaga series to a new development team, resulting in a number of changes. The gameplay system was redesigned based on feedback from Episode I. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka, was based on the original draft by Takahashi and Soraya Saga, with Episode II being Saga's last contribution to the main trilogy. The music was composed by Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe, who worked separately on the cinematic and gameplay soundtracks respectively. Upon release, the game received praise from critics, with the majority of criticism going towards some of its altered gameplay mechanics. Despite strong sales in both Japan and North America, it failed to meet projected sales targets. Alongside Episode II, the staff expanded the Xenosaga series into other projects. A portion of the planned Xenosaga narrative by Takahashi and Saga was made into Xenosaga Pied Piper, released in 2004 for mobile devices. The game was remade along with Episode I as part of Xenosaga I II for the Nintendo DS. The final Xenosaga game, Xenosaga Episode III, was released in 2006. Xenosaga Episode II is a role playing video game the player controls a party of characters that expands during the course of the game, navigating them through a variety of environments tied to the progression of the story. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told mainly through traditional full motion cutscenes. Exploring environments, the party can collect a variety of items from destroying objects some items can be used in gameplay to boost a character's statistics or restore health. Most areas can be navigated on foot, but some require the use of mechs. In addition to the main campaign, the party can engage in side quests which vary from finding items to completing difficult battles, and unlock optional dungeon environments in which players can fight enemies and obtain rare items. During navigation, the party can see enemy units in the field, choosing whether or not to engage them. When an encounter is triggered, the party and enemy fights in a dedicated arena. The combat is governed by a turn based battle system. Any of the three member player party can be swapped out in battle at the cost of a turn. Each character has access to melee and ranged standard attacks, can use items to affect the party or enemies, and guard against attacks. The player party's attacks are determined through button combinations, with different combinations triggering different attack sequences that can have secondary effects on the party and neighboring enemies. The types and power of actions taken by characters is governed by their available action points AP , which can be saved using the Boost option in battle. After saving enough AP, a character can perform a special attack with their accumulated AP, with some Boost attacks ignoring turn order to allow a character who has yet to move to steal an enemy's turn and perform an action. A character's position on the battlefield can be shifted, which directly affects what attacks they perform and how they interact with neighboring party members. Characters have three level of attacks A high , B mid and C low . Each enemy is vulnerable to a particular sequence of attacks. Upon completing a sequence of attacks an enemy is weak to, the enemy is knocked out, rendering them unable to move. When knocked out, a party member can perform a special attack which deals high damage. Two characters can also cooperate on a Dual attack, which deals high damage to enemies. In addition to battling on foot, mecha specific to a character can be summoned. While each mech has a fixed main pilot, the sub pilot can be changed, which alters the types of attacks the mech can perform. After defeating the enemy, the party receives experience points which raise their basic statistics, and skill points which are used to upgrade each character's skill tree, unlocking new skills. New items and accessories can only be gathered either through searching the environment or defeating enemies, as currency and shops are not present. Like its predecessor, Xenosaga Episode II takes place in a universe based around science fiction. In the year 20XX , the Zoharan artifact dating from the beginning of the universe which connects to the realm of a god like energy dubbed U DOwas unearthed by an archeological expedition in Kenya the Zohar is key to enabling humanity to travel in space beyond the Solar System. Over 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth behind to colonize the galaxy following a terrible event, resulting in Earth's location being lost and the planet being dubbed Lost Jerusalem by the game's events, humanity has adopted a new calendar system dubbed Transcend Christ T.C. , with the game's events taking place in T.C. 4767equivalent to A.D. 7277. Humanity is now spread across 500,000 planets, with their governments forming the Galaxy Federation. Planets are connected through a time warp travel network called the Unus Mundus Network U.M.N. . The U.M.N. is managed by Vector Industries, which also controls interests in the Federations military. Existing alongside humans are Realians, synthetic humans who hold equal status with natural humans. The Federation has come under attack from an ancient alien race called the Gnosis, which begin decimating Federation worlds. As normal weapons are ineffective against them, Vector develops two different weapon systems designed to fight them humanoid mecha dubbed AGWS Anti Gnosis Weapon System , and the similar but more powerful KOS MOS battle androids. There also exist more advanced AGWS models called E.S., powered by Lost Jerusalem artifacts called Vessels of Anima. Important organizations include the Kukai Foundation, a group that acts as a shelter for enhanced humans the U TIC Organization, a once scientific group that now wishes to gain control of the Zohar and Ormus, a secretive cult who worship Lost Jerusalem which secretly funds U TIC and operations through a political faction called the Immigrant Fleet. A key episode in the game's backstory is the Miltian Conflict, which occurred fourteen years before the events of Episode I on the planet Miltia beginning due to a war between U TIC and the Federation, it escalated due to a group of Realians going berserk and attacking people indiscriminately. The planet of Miltia was lost in a space time anomaly when an experiment involving U.R.T.Vsan army of 669 genetically modified children designed to combat U DO's energiesgoes horribly wrong. Following the apparent destruction of Miltia, new settlements and a new government are established on a neighboring planet named Second Miltia. During the events of Episode I, main protagonist Shion Uzuki and her creation the anti Gnosis android prototype KOS MOS are forced to escape a Gnosis attack triggered by the discovery of a Zohar Emulator. During their journey to Second Miltia aboard the passenger freighter Elsa, they are pursued by U TIC forces encounter more Gnosis seeking the Zohar Emulator and Shion experiences visions of a young girl named Nephilim and a deceased friend Febronia, the latter of whom asks her to free her sisters Cecily and Cathe. Sheltering with the Kulai Foundation, they are eventually forced to confront Albedo Piazzolla, an unhinged U.R.T.V. determined to reach Miltia, when he threatens Second Miltia with a powerful weapon called the Proto Merkabah. The group destroy the Proto Merkabah, but Albedo escapes with data that could lead the way to Miltia. Episode II picks up immediately after the ending of Episode I, when the Elsa arrives on Miltia. The main protagonists are Shion Uzuki, a scientist for Vector Industries and Jr., a U.R.T.V. survivor of the U DO experiment who runs the Kukai Foundation with his brother Gaignun. The main party includes Jin Uzuki, Shion's estranged brother KOS MOS, a prototype anti Gnosis battle android chaos, a melancholy young man with mysterious powers MOMO, a prototype Realian created by U TIC scientist Joachim Mizrahi and modeled after his dead daughter Ziggyshort for Ziggurat 8a cyborg who acts as MOMO's guardian and Canaan, a combat Realian who worked with chaos during the Miltian Conflict. Other characters include Allen Ridgeley, a co worker of Shion main antagonist Albedo Piazzolla, the insane brother of Jr. and Gaignun Margulis, a high ranking officer in U TIC Sergius, the apparent leader of both Ormus and the Immigrant Fleet Dmitri Yuriev, creator and biological father of the U.R.T.Vs Wilhelm, CEO of Vector and Nephilim, a young girl who appears to Shion in visions. Episode II begins fourteen years prior to the opening of Episode I during the Miltian Conflict. Canaan and chaos are sent to investigate, discovering that people are being driven insane by the Song of Nephilim , a harmony that affects the mind. They are saved from an ambush by Jin, who has stolen data implicating the people using the Song. After fending off an attack by Margulis that leaves Margulis scarred, Jin transfers the data into Canaan's mind to keep it safe. Fourteen years later, the data remains locked, with the key to unlocking it still being on Miltia. Now based on Second Miltia, Canaan is assigned to protect the crew of the Elsa following their arrival. Upon arrival, Shion reluctantly hands KOS MOS over to Vector officials while instructing Allen to keep an eye on her, while Ziggy prepares to escort MOMO to have the data implanted by Joachim Mizrahi retrieved. During her stay, Shion receives a vision from Nephilim, asking her to help Cecily and Cathe as she promised. While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, chaos and Jr. are attacked by U TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence for the deaths of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by Albedo, who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by Albedo activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. and the rest of the group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals that he and his brothers were part of an experiment by Dmitri Yuriev Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U DO. The three were close, but Albedo became disturbed when he discovered his ability to survive any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U DO, resulting in everyone except himself, Albedo and Gaignun being killed. Albedo was touched by U DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, Albedo hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, Albedo opens the way to Miltia. With the way to Miltia opened, the Federation, U TIC, and the Immigrant Fleet fight each other for control of the Zohar hidden on the planet. Shion and Allen attempt to reach Miltia, but are almost destroyed by U TIC forces and only saved due to KOS MOS's spontaneous activation and intervention. With help from Gaignun and the Second Miltia government, the group then launch an assault with the Elsa, destroying the Immigrant Fleet mothership before being rescued by Gaignun as the space time distortion around Miltia vanishes. Joined by Jin and Canaan, they unlock the data within Canaan, revealing that the Immigrant Fleet has funded U TIC since its inception, and that MOMO's father Mizrahi sacrificed himself to seal Miltia away after Albedo released the energy U DO. After a skirmish with Margulis, the group find the Zohar and two deformed comatose Realians used to control its energy these are Cecily and Cathe. Shion reluctantly allows KOS MOS to kill Cecily and Cathe. The Zohar is claimed by Sergius on behalf of Ormus and the Immigrant Fleet. He installs the Zohar into the Proto Omega, a giant machine built within the structure of Miltia, with the intent of destroying the Gnosis and Federation so Ormus will be free to rediscover Lost Jerusalem. Shion's group escape on the Elsa as the Proto Omega activates, destroying both Miltia and the surrounding armies of the Federation and Ormus. As the group launch an assault on the Proto Omega, Gaignunwho had previously killed Yuriev after refusing to kill Jr. as orderedis possessed by the spirit of Yuriev, who takes over the Federation government and launches his own attack on the Proto Omega. When the group face Sergius, they are aided by Albedo, but Albedo is apparently killed by Sergius. After their battle, Sergius is killed by a group of cloaked men dubbed the Testaments due to exceeding his role in their plans. The Testaments then resurrect Albedo and give him control of the Zohar, which immediately unleashes U DO's energy. Jr. is forced to kill Albedo, dispersing the U DO energy, but is comforted by Nephilim. Before the Zohar can be retrieved, a massive ship dubbed Abel's Ark appears and absorbs the Zohar. Wilhelm, who has been observing events, speaks telepathically with chaos while calling him Yeshua , praising his decision to become an active player in events. In a post credits scene, Wilhelm confers with the Testaments about recent events while welcoming a new white cloaked member. Following the release of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other responsibilities within the company in addition to being given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation was that he did not want to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that his style of direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga. Development on Episode II took approximately two years, worked on by a staff of 60 to 100 people. The staff was divided into three teams scene , battle and quest . During production, Hagiwara and the other new staff aimed to turn Xenosaga into an evolving series rather than a static one. The gameplay was mainly carried over from Episode I, but with adjustments and additions designed to streamline the system and increase playability. The battle system was adjusted based on feedback that the first game's battle system was too complicated. The art director for the game was Norihiro Takami. While the character designs of Episode I were stylized, the cast were redesigned for Episode II to appear much more realistic. This was done to increase the expressiveness of the characters during cutscenes. The graphics engine was completely rebuilt for the second game. The new E.S. mecha were designed by Kouichi Mugitani and Junya Ishigaki each wanted to emulate the design choices of Episode I while also creating something unique to Episode II. Mugitani also resumed his role from Episode I as production designer. The concept and scenario draft was written by Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes and turn them into a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in subsequent changes to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series in the context of Episode II, the subtitle was said to represent the blurring of boundaries between concepts of right and wrong, in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology. Xenosaga Episode II was first announced in July 2003 during a special event dedicated to the productions of Monolith Soft. It was announced alongside the international version of the first game Xenosaga Episode I Reloaded, and the company's new title Baten Kaitos Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. The game was released by Namco in Japan on June 24, 2004. The game was first shown off internationally at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, with its release window being announced by Namco in August of that year. Episode II was released in North America on February 15, 2005. The game was localized by Namco's internal localization department. Dubbing was handled by Cup of Tea Productions Xenosaga Episode II was the company's very first project. For Episode II, several actors were recast including the voice actress for KOS MOS. While Episode I was not released in Europe, Namco partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to release Episode II on October 28, 2005. A Special Edition exclusive to Europe released alongside the normal version, containing a movie DVD detailing the events leading up to Episode II. It is the only Xenosaga title to be released in the region. The music for Xenosaga Episode II was composed by Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe. The two worked respectively on the cinematic and gameplay tracks they did not collaborate on any tracks, or even meet during the game's production. The original game's composer Yasunori Mitsuda refused to return to the series due to both a busy schedule and a clash of interests with Namco over the direction of the game. Hosoe, whose previous work included Street Fighter EX and the Ridge Racer series, was forced to greatly restrict his compositions' quality due to working with the limited sound hardware on the PS2. He felt that both the sound quality and overall direction of the soundtrack were faulted because of this. Kajiura, whose previous work consisted mostly of anime scores, felt that the game's soundtrack was different from her earlier work due to the different pieces linking with each other, although some tracks were split up by the production team when she composed them to merge as a single melody. She also found it easier working from Mitsuda's rather than creating a completely original score. The realistic art design also influenced Kajiura's work, as she wished to complement it. Kajura's compositions were released on a two disc album in July 2004, while some of Hosoe's music was released on a promotional disc as part of the North American strategy guide. The rest of Hosoe's music for the game has yet to receive an album release. During its first week on sale in Japan, Xenosaga Episode II reached second place in gaming charts, selling around 186,000 units. The following week the game dropped to the third place with further sales of over 32,000 units, contributing to a general decline in game sales during that period. Within two weeks of its release, the game had sold nearly 219,000 units in Japan. According to Namco's fiscal report in February 2005, the game had sold 280,000 units in Japan by that time. According to their later 2005 fiscal year report, Episode II was one of Namco's better selling titles in North America, although no exact sales figures were given. According to a later report, Episode II underperformed commercially, reaching just over 50 of Namco's projected sales target. Japanese magazine Famitsu felt that the characters and world view was enjoyable, but felt that some scenes were forced and the cutscenes ran too long. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised its characters and plot, but found the story uncomfortably long and complicated, requiring too much foreknowledge of the original game to be enjoyable for series newcomers. GamePro, while noting that the cinematics might be too long for some, enjoyed the story and its continuation of the first game's narrative. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot enjoyed both the narrative and its focus on the cast, and GameSpy's Christian Nutt praised the narrative's revelations despite pacing issues and a lack of meaningful progress with the overarching narrative. Jeremy Dunham of IGN found the shift from Shion to Jr.'s narrative to be jarring, but generally enjoyed the overarching narrative and the new characters, Parkin noted that the character models were sexed up from the previous game, while GamePro generally praised the overhaul to the game's graphics and character design. Massimilla praised the more realistic character designs and polished visuals. Dunham noted that the increased visual quality and redone character designs helped in the game's presentation, though he found the soundtrack lacking when measured against the first game's score. He also criticized the replacement of some characters' English voices. Famitsu enjoyed the higher speed of battle compared to Episode I. Parkin echoed these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost and the addition of side quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla felt that the simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience in addition to being shorter than other RPGs available at the time. Nutt felt that the alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking any meaningful customization options. Dunham echoed other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in game currency to buy items. Development of Xenosaga Episode III began while work was finishing on Episode II. While the team were open to further entries based on the game's commercial performance, it was designed to be the last entry in the series. Arai and Yonesaka returned respectively as director and scriptwriter. Takahashi provided the scenario draft and supervised the writing. Episode III released in 2006 in Japan and North America. Episode III was the last game released in the Xenosaga series. A part of the planned narrative for Episode II was incorporated into Xenosaga Pied Piper. Released in July 2004 for mobile devices, the game was co developed by Monolith Soft, Namco Mobile and Tom Create as part of a move to make Xenosaga a multimedia franchise accessing a wide audience. Both Episode II and Episode I were remade for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I II, released in March 2006. Co developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Both Pied Piper and Xenosaga I II remain exclusive to Japan.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga%20Episode%20II
"Xenosaga Episode III Also Sprach Zarathustra is a role playing video game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. It is the final entry in both the Xenosaga trilogy and the larger Xenosaga series, which forms part of the Xeno franchise. Concluding the narrative of Xenosaga Episode I and Episode II, Episode III sees Shion Uzuki and the battle android KOS MOS search out the origins of the hostile alien Gnosis while being hunted by Shion's former employers and four powerful humans called the Testaments. Gameplay is carried over from the first two games, featuring exploration of environments through a linear narrative, while battles follow a turn based system featuring multiple leveling systems and combat with both a human party and mecha. Concept work for Xenosaga Episode III began during the later development of Xenosaga Episode II in 2004. The development team's aim was to address issues raised by fans and staff with the previous two Xenosaga games, along with bringing the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Due to the decision to turn the intended six part series into a trilogy, the original draft for Episode III was substantially reworked. As with previous Xenosaga titles, the subtitle was drawn from the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. While the game was praised by critics and went on to sell over 340,000 copies worldwide, the mixed response to the Xenosaga series as a whole left Monolith Soft staff in a state of low morale, partially leading to the development of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenosaga Episode III is a role playing video game where players take control of a party of characters during the game they explore a variety of environments from towns and cities to dungeons. During the course of the game, a Database is filled out which holds entries on terminology, characters, story events and earlier events from past Xenosaga games. The game features a variety of quests including the main narrative and side quests accepted from non playable characters. The party can purchase items and equipment from shops found in friendly environments throughout the game. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told through both traditional full motion cutscenes and segments with voiced text boxes within the game environments. Enemies such as monsters can be seen in environments, to be avoided or engaged as wished the party can also place traps which temporarily immobilize an enemy unit. When the party makes contact with a monster, the battle is initiated. Triggering a battle with a trapped enemy grants a boost in battle. Combat is split into two types one with the human party members, and one using combat mechs dubbed E.S. units. When battle begins, the player and enemy parties fight in a dedicated combat arena. The combat is governed by a turn based battle system. The player party is restricted to three members, but at the cost of one turn an active character can be switched out for a reserve character. Each character has a certain number of health points HP and Ether points EP . If all HP is depleted, a character is defeated. Turn order is governed by a character's Agility statistic. Each character can take a variety of actions, ranging from attacking, performing special attacks called Arts and using Ether abilities that each consume EP, using items, taking defensive positions that reduce damage, and escaping the battle. Both the player party and enemies have Break gauges, which fill up when either side successfully lands an attack. When the gauge fills, that character is stunned and cannot act for two turns, in addition becoming more vulnerable to a high damage Critical attack. The Break gauge can be reduced by using Ether abilities, which can also be used along with items to recover HP. Each player character has a Boost gauge that builds up during battle, which can be used to either perform two actions in a single turn, or deliver character specific special attacks. If an enemy is killed with a Boost attackan action labelled Finish Strike they at the end of battle they are granted a boost to their experience points EXP , in game money and skill points SP used to upgrade abilities. EXP raises a character's health and basic statistics. SP are invested in skill trees for each character, with each tree having a different emphasis in its skills to unlock some trees include powerful Ether attacks, others Break damage, and others defensive or supportive abilities. Combat in E.S. mecha is governed by similar mechanics to normal battle. Some dungeons in the game are only navigable with mechs, while others enable the player to switch between navigating on foot or in mechs. Three mechs can be active at any one time, with a fourth in reserve to replace one which is knocked out in battle. Mechs can perform standard and special attacks, with the type of attacks available determined by that mech's equipped weapon. Each mech has a finite energy level, which their equipped weapon draws upon to perform an action. Each time a mech strikes an enemy with an attack, their Anima gauge will fill up. When full, the mech can enter Anima Mode , a temporary state where attack power is raised and energy costs for actions are lowered. E.S. units are customized and upgraded in five different areas, with each area granting different status buffs to the mech, such as raising health regeneration during charging periods or increasing EXP awarded at the end of a battle. Like the rest of the series, Xenosaga Episode III takes place in a science fiction universe. In the year 20XX , the Zoharan artifact dating from the beginning of the universe which connects to the realm of a god like energy dubbed U DOwas unearthed by an archeological expedition in Kenya the Zohar is key to enabling humanity to travel in space beyond the Solar System. Over 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth behind to colonize the galaxy following a terrible event, resulting in Earth's location being lost and the planet being dubbed Lost Jerusalem by the game's events, humanity has adopted a new calendar system dubbed Transcend Christ T.C. , with the game's events taking place in T.C. 4768equivalent to A.D. 7278. Humanity is now spread across 500,000 planets, with their governments forming the Galaxy Federation. Planets are connected through a warp travel network called the Unus Mundus Network U.M.N. . The U.M.N. is managed by Vector Industries, which also controls interests in the Federation's military. Existing alongside humans are Realians, synthetic humans who hold equal status with natural humans. The Federation has come under attack from an ancient alien race called the Gnosis, which begins decimating Federation worlds. As normal weapons are ineffective, Vector develops two different weapon systems designed to fight them humanoid mecha dubbed A.G.W.S. Anti Gnosis Weapon System , and the similar but more powerful KOS MOS battle androids. There also exist more advanced AGWS models called E.S., powered by Lost Jerusalem artifacts called Vessels of Anima. Important organizations include the Kukai Foundation, a group that acts as a shelter for enhanced humans the U TIC Organization, a once scientific group that now wishes to gain control of the Zohar and Ormus, a secretive cult from Lost Jerusalem which secretly funds U TIC and operates through a political faction called the Immigrant Fleet. A key episode in the game's backstory is the Miltian Conflict, which occurred fourteen years before the events of Episode I on the planet Miltia beginning due to a war between U TIC and the Federation, it escalated due to a group of Realians going berserk and attacking people indiscriminately. The planet of Miltia was lost in a space time anomaly when an experiment involving U.R.T.Vsan army of 669 genetically modified children designed to combat U DO's energiesgoes horribly wrong. During the events of Xenosaga Episode I, main protagonist Shion Uzuki and her creation the anti Gnosis android KOS MOS are forced to escape an Gnosis attack triggered by the discovery of a Zohar Emulator, a manmade copy of the Zohar. During their journey to Second Miltia aboard the passenger freighter Elsa, they are pursued by U TIC forces encounter more Gnosis seeking the Zohar Emulator and Shion experiences visions of a young girl named Nephilim. Sheltering with the Kulai Foundation, they are eventually forced to confront Albedo Piazzolla, an unhinged U.R.T.V. determined to reach Miltia, when he threatens Second Miltia with a powerful weapon called the Proto Merkabah. The group destroy the Proto Merkabah, but Albedo escapes with data that could open the way to Miltia. During Xenosaga Episode II, Albedo succeeds in accessing Miltia, using the conflict between Ormus and the Federation to access a powerful mech called the Proto Omega. The Testaments grant him access to the Zohar, forcing party member and fellow U.R.T.V. Jr. to kill him. Following the defeat of the Proto Omega, the Zohar is absorbed by a giant ship dubbed Abel's Ark . Over the next year, Shion learns that Vector and her father were directly involved the U TIC's activities, resigning from Vector following a series of Gnosis attacks dubbed the Gnosis Terrorism . The main protagonists are Shion Uzuki, a former employee of Vector Industries and KOS MOS, a prototype anti Gnosis battle android. They are accompanied on their journey by Jr., a U.R.T.V. survivor who runs the Kukai Foundation with his brother Gaignun and commands both the Elsa and the ship Durandal Jin Uzuki, Shion's brother and a veteran of the Miltian Conflict chaos, a melancholy young man with mysterious powers MOMO, a prototype Realian created by U TIC scientist Joachim Mizrahi and modeled after his dead daughter Ziggyshort for Ziggurat 8a cyborg who acts as MOMO's guardian and Canaan, a combat Realian who worked with chaos during the Miltian Conflict. Other characters include Allen Ridgeley, a former co worker of Shion Wilhelm, CEO of Vector and the main antagonist T elos, an anti Gnosis battle android similar to KOS MOS Margulis, a high ranking officer in U TIC Dmitri Yuriev, creator and biological father of the U.R.T.Vs who has survived through possessing Gaignun's body Nephilim, a young girl who appears to Shion in visions and Abel, a young man connected to U DO. Serving Wilhelm are the Testaments, resurrected men with supernatural abilities they are the Red Testament Kevin Winnicot, Shion's former love interest the Blue Testament Luis Virgil, a former Federation officer the Black Testament Voyager, an old adversary of Ziggy and the White Testament Albedo, the U.R.T.V. brother of Jr. and Gaignun. Following her resignation from Vector in the wake of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the GnosisT elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS MOS and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T elos. As KOS MOS's weaponry is the only way to break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark. Entering the hyperspace pocket, the group find the Elsa and investigate the area, encountering both Albedo and Virgil and learning that the Vessels of Anima powering their E.S. mecha are key to the Testaments' plans. They are then confronted by Mantelwho reveals himself as the Red Testamentand T elos. T elos almost kills KOS MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to be a world within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered nearly everyone in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to resonate with the Zohar, summoning the Gnosis and awakening U DO it was only Mizrahi's self sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febroniawho tended him when he was injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her deathand follows her into the afterlife. The Red Testament also appears, revealing his true identity as Kevin and asking Shion to join him. Evading Kevin and T elos, the group escape from Shion's subconscious back into the normal world, but following this Shion becomes emotionally unstable. During their absence, the Federation government is manipulated by Yuriev into assaulting Ormus in search of an artifact called Zarathustra. Abel's Ark, summoned by the events in Shion's subconscious, appears in the real world and begins causing planets to vanish as it pursues Zarathustra. Nephilim asks Shion to free Abel from Yuriev's control, then Yuriev leads the Federation fleet and Omega to capture the Durendal. Yuriev activates the Zohar Emulators stored in the Durandal, intent on using them in combination with Omega and Abel's Ark to defeat U DO by rising to godhood. The group successfully infiltrate Abel's Ark, where Jr. kills Yuriev with help from Albedo. Albedo then teleports Abel and the Zohar away. The conflict results in Albedo's consciousness merging with Jr., while Gaignun dies along with Yuriev. The group follow Abel and the Zohar to the planet Michtam, the holy land of Ormus. There they kill a disillusioned Margulis, and Canaan sacrifices himself to destroy Voyager. Descending deeper into Michtam, Shion experiences visions of Lost Jerusalem, seeing chaos under the name Yeshua alongside a previous incarnation of herself, KOS MOS's physical template Mary Magdalene, and Jesus prior to his death. In a final confrontation with T elos, they learn that T elos and KOS MOS were both designed by Wilhelm and the Testaments to resurrect Mary Magdalene, with KOS MOS holding her spirit and T elos being made from her body. The group are then confronted by Kevin, who asks KOS MOS and Shion to join him. Shion, blinded by her love, joins him until Allen convinces her otherwise, voicing his own long held love. The group then confront Wilhelm at Zarathustra's resting place. Wilhelm reveals that he has been preserving the universe from ending due to human wills that reject connection with U DO by capturing U DO's eyes Abel and Abel's Ark and using eternal recurrence, Wilhelm has trapped the universe in a time loop with the power of Zarathustra and the Zohar. The Gnosis are revealed to be spawned from the wills that reject U DO and escape from U DO's realm. Shion, whose necklace and will are key to activating Zarathustra, is tortured by Wilhelm in an attempt to make her wish for recurrence. KOS MOS shatters the necklace, preventing the recurrence from ever happening. A redeemed Kevin then sacrifices himself to destroy Wilhelm, allowing the group to cripple Zarathustra. Abel, Nephilim, KOS MOS and chaos choose to stay on Michtam, drawing all Gnosis to them and using a dimensional shift to move that region of space to Lost Jerusalem. Their actions and the release of chaos's Anima energywhich is accelerating the universe's deathwill delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will and saving the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster than light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr., Shelley, Mary, and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the mid and post credit scenes, a badly damaged KOS MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they will both awake when they are needed. KOS MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem. Development of Xenosaga Episode III began in 2004 during the final development stages of Episode II. While Xenosaga was initially planned as a six part series, changes at developer Monolith Soft resulted in series creator Tetsuya Takahashi giving guidance of the series to younger developers within the company. During this period, the team decided to turn the Xenosaga series into a trilogy, resulting in changes to the planned scenario and some elements being turned into side projects such as Xenosaga Pied Piper. The director was Koh Arai, who had previously directed Episode II. Takahashi drafted and supervised the scenario, which was written by Episode II writer Norihiko Yonesaka. One of the main goals when developing Episode III was not only to bring a satisfactory end to the Xenosaga storyline up to that point, but to address criticism of the short length of Episode II's story, while also addressing general problems noticed with both Episode I and Episode II. Namco Bandai later stated in an interview that the game's final form was based on both fan feedback and the wishes of internal staff, with the final game being something very close to what to be the original ideal . According to original Xenosaga writer Soraya Saga, the changes to the original narrative plan for Episode II resulted in several narrative shifts within Episode III, deviating from Takahashi and Saga's original draft. The scenario for Episode III includes narrative elements Takahashi originally created for Episode II, which had been cut from Episode II due to time constraints. As with the rest of the trilogy, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology. The game's subtitle was taken from the native title of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, a novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series. The original character artist for Xenosaga, Kunihiko Tanaka, was replaced by Kouichi Mugitani, who also acted as production designer as he had for the previous Xenosaga games. The character designs were adjusted to balance between the designs of Episode I and Episode II, expressing both realism and an exaggerated cute artstyle. While most of the designs were adaptions of Tanaka's earlier work, Mugitani also designed a new version of KOS MOS and multiple new mechs. Mugitani's mech and armor designs drew from both the Gundam franchise and the 1997 film adaptation of Starship Troopers. Xenosaga Episode III was officially announced in 2005, alongside Xenosaga I IIa Nintendo DS remake of the first two Xenosaga episodesand Baten Kaitos Origins. With its announcement, it was widely confirmed that it would be the last installment in the Xenosaga series. While Episode III was intended as the conclusion of Shion's story arc and potentially the series, the team were willing to continue the series if the game was a commercial success. The game was announced for a western release in April 2006. For its western release, all scenes where blood was visible were censored the blood was removed, but all other elements remained unchanged, resulting in visual and audio inconsistencies. The game released in Japan on July 6, 2006 by Namco in North America, the game released on August 29 of that year by Namco Bandai Games. The game was localized for the West by Namco Bandai and 8 4 Xenosaga Episode III was one of 8 4's earliest projects. English dubbing was handled by Cup of Tea Productions, who had previously worked on Episode II. Several original voice actors from Episode I, including KOS MOS's original English actress Bridget Hoffman, were brought back after the recasting for Episode II. Unlike Episode II, Episode III was not released in Europe. The music for Episode III was composed by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous contributed to the score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased work load of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to the work she did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression of the setting when creating the score. Takahashi, in addition to his other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring selections from the game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's brevity was due to the fact that the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two disc release. During its debut week, Xenosaga Episode III reached number 2 in the charts behind New Super Mario Bros. with sales approaching 124,000 units. While its sales were stronger than Xenosaga I II, it was a lower debut than the previous entries in the trilogy. It sold over 181,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. During Q3 of 2006, the game sold a total of 343,000 across Japan, mainland Asia and North America. Simon Parkin, in an import review for Eurogamer, felt that the sheer number of philosophical and religious elements in the story both stifled any relatable narrative and robbed the characters of any personality despite this he felt the ending successfully tied up remaining narrative threads from previous games. Famitsu enjoyed the narrative's presentation, but noted the lack of a focused narrative due to the number of story threads needing addressing. GamePro said the story came to an intriguing conclusion , but felt that the cutscenes were too long. GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla enjoyed the story and character conclusions, but felt that understanding the story and terminology required too much referral to the in game encyclopedia. Eduardo Vasconcellos of GameSpy found the story long winded, while IGN's Jeremy Dunham found the narrative to be one of the best aspects of the game. RPGamer's Josh Martz called the story a triumphant conclusion to Shion's arc of the series . Both Parkin and Massimilla criticized the censoring of blood and its negative effects on the story's more dramatic moments. Parkin enjoyed the battle system's mechanics, but found the rest of the gameplay extremely straightforward due to a lack of complex environments or side activities. GamePro gave high praise to the combat system and lack of random encounters, in addition to calling the mini game practically its own entire game, and fun, too . Massimilla praised the balanced mechanics of the battle system and customization options. Vasconcellos also enjoyed the customization options available to the player, in addition to the battle system. Dunham enjoyed the combat system and its blending of elements from past games, but was disappointed that no new elements had been added. Martz also enjoyed the varied systems and strategy within combat, despite noting a lack of overall challenge. Parkin praised the middle ground balance in the character designs between the deformed look of Episode I and the realism of Episode II. Famitsu praised the shortened loading times, and GamePro praised the graphics and art design while criticizing the voice acting quality. Massimilla positively noted the game's art design, cutscene animation, and music and sound design. Both Dunham and Martz praised both music and voice acting. Xenosaga Episode III was the last property to be released in the Xenosaga series. Following the release of Episode III, and the mixed reception received by the series as a whole, the entire development team were in a state of low morale. Partly to boost team morale and create a game players would enjoy, the team developed a new RPG for the Wii originally titled Monado Beginning of the World, its title was eventually changed to Xenoblade Chronicles. During its development, the team moved away from the narrative and design techniques used for the Xenosaga games, which were considered old fashioned. The success of Xenoblade Chronicles led to the development of further Xeno titles. In a later interview, Takahashi stated that he would be willing to develop further titles in the Xenosaga series if funding was provided.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga%20Episode%20III
"Xenosaga I II is a role playing video game co developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, and published by Namco for the Nintendo DS. A spin off of the Xenosaga trilogy and forming part of the Xeno metaseries, Xenosaga I II retells the events Xenosaga Episode I and Xenosaga Episode II while expanding on its characters and narrative. Displayed from an angled two dimensional perspective, Xenosaga I II makes use of a turn based battle system with elements carried over from the main Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I II, Monolith Soft's first portable video game title, began development in 2005 following the completion of Xenosaga The Animation. The scenario, drafted and supervised by series creator Tetsuya Takahashi, was intended to retell the story of the two games while incorporating events that had originally been cut. The game was released exclusively in Japan in March 2006. Upon release, it received generally positive reviews from critics, but was not commercially successful. Xenosaga I II is a role playing video game which retells the events of Xenosaga Episode I and its direct sequel Episode II. Cutscenes and the in game environments and character sprites are displayed on the Nintendo DS DS console's top screen, with events outside still animated cutscenes taking place from an angled top down perspective using two dimensional graphics. Additional information is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Environments can be freely explored, with breakable chests holding consumable items and accessories. Shops within the levels can be used to purchase items and equipment using in game currency. Special EVA structures within the environment can be used to recover health points HP and a type of skill point called ether points EP . Characters are able to both roam around open environments and enter story based dungeons. During the course of the story, the player receives emails through the U.M.N. service, which is also used to store the game's glossary, a store of information on the world and characters. Unlike the original versions, Xenosaga I II features random encounters within the environment, with enemies only appearing in the battle arena. During battle, the battle arena is displayed on the DS's top screen while commands and party status is displayed on the bottom screen. Battles are governed by a turn based battle system similar to the main Xenosaga games. Battles take plates on a 5x6 grid divided between the main party and the enemy party. During their turn, a character can move to any part of their half of the grid. The party's statistics are divided between HP, EP which is drained by using Ether abilities, attack points AP when a party member performs an attack, and a boost count gauge which is filled when an enemy attacks. Each character is given two actions per turn, with one physical and one magical attack per character. When a character has three AP available, they can attack twice and trigger a special cinematic attack which deals high damage. The Boost meter, once filled, grants either side additional turns. In addition to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New formations are acquired through the course of the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In addition to standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles. Early development work for Xenosaga I II began following the completion of Xenosaga The Animation in 2005, although plans existed while the anime was in development. Xenosaga I II was co developed by Xenosaga series developer Monolith Soft and external studio Tom Create. It was Monolith Soft's first time developing a portable game, as they had previously only worked on home console titles. The script was written by Yuichiro Takeda, whose previous work included both Xenosaga The Animation and Xenosaga CD dramas. The script was based on drafts by series creator Tetsuya Takahashi, who supervised the writing process. Staff related to multiple video game and anime projects took part, with their previous work including Xenosaga The Animation. Character designs were redrawn by Hiroshi Takeuchi, who had done artwork for Cowboy Bebop and My HiME. The drawing director was Ai Kikuchi, who had worked on the anime adaptation of the Star Ocean The Second Story manga. Cutscene director Hiroyuki Okawa had worked on both Xenosaga The Animation and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. Coloring for cutscene artwork was done by Studio Deen. The music was composed by Kousuke Yamashita, who had previously worked on both Xenosaga The Animation and the Nobunaga's Ambition series. Due to the size of the narrative, the game used a 2D art style so minimal story content was cut. Voice acting was limited to victory quotes after successful battles, with the rest of the story communicated solely with text. Takeda was first shown the project while still working on Xenosaga The Animation, a work load he estimated at six months. Once work on the anime had finished, Takeda and Takahashi began work on the script. Takahashi created the draft based on his original plans for the Xenosaga storyline, which had needed substantial alteration for the original Episode I and Episode II due to both design and time limitations. The scenario for Episode I required little alteration as it was relatively unaltered from Takahashi's initial draft. For Episode II, more substantial alterations were made such as rearranging flashback sequences so the story would maintain an uninterrupted flow, and greatly expanding information concerning the Immigrant Fleet faction and the origins of central character Jr.. During the beta period of script development, the scenario for Episode II only made up 30 of the whole game, which was seen as a drastic imbalance requiring rewrites to address it. To better connect the two storylines, characters from Episode II were given minor cameos within the events of Episode I. A major change was the shift to the viewpoint of main protagonist Shion Uzuki, as Episode II originally portrayed events from the perspective of Jr., a concession that enabled events to be fleshed out. Despite these changes, keeping the narrative consistent with the in development Xenosaga Episode III was a necessity. Ultimately the scenario came close to what Takahashi originally intended for Episode I and Episode II. The total writing work on Xenosaga I II lasted over six months, with Takeda needing to visit Monolith Soft's offices once a week to discuss the script. The game was first announced in December 2004 under the working title Xenosaga DS alongside a DS game in the Baten Kaitos series. The game's official title and release window were announced in September 2005 alongside reveal of Xenosaga Episode III and Baten Kaitos Origins. The game released on March 30, 2006 it was the fourth video game release in the Xenosaga franchise. Along with the mobile spin off Xenosaga Pied Piper, Xenosaga I II remains exclusive to Japan. During its debut week on sale in Japan, the game debuted outside the top ten, reaching fifteenth place with sales of over 17,000 units. These low sales were noted as disappointing for a game within the Xenosaga series, which was still popular in Japan. By the end of 2006, the game had sold 38,500 units. While Japanese magazine Famitsu praised the game's storyline, with one reviewer saying the story was the main reason for playing the game, another reviewer found the technical terminology slowed the pace. RPGFan writer Neal Chandran felt that the story was lacking despite the additions and supplementary material, although he found that the story delivery struck a better balance with gameplay than the original games. RPGamer's Michael Baker positively compared the story to a particularly well organized season of Star Trek The Next Generation in spite of the need to read the in game encyclopedia to keep up with its terminology, but noted that the amount of text could be off putting, also citing the game being in Japanese as a barrier to importing the title. In its review, one Famitsu reviewer found elements of the gameplay quite challenging despite it being an orthodox role playing game. Chandran enjoyed the additions to saving and navigation, and praised the battle system despite some pacing issues and annoying mechanics. Baker praised the streamlining of general gameplay and the battle system, lauding the removal of the more convoluted mechanics of the original games. His main complaint was the mini games, which he found lacked substance. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot compared the battle system to the mainline Xenosaga titles, positively noting the battle system mechanics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga%20I%20%26%20II
"The Xenosaga series is a series of science fiction role playing video games developed by Monolith Soft and published by Namco Bandai on the PlayStation 2. The series began with the 2002 release of Episode I Der Wille zur Macht, which was followed in 2004 by Episode II Jenseits von Gut und Bose and in 2006 by Episode III Also sprach Zarathustra. The music of Xenosaga includes the soundtracks to all three chapters, as well as the music for its spin off media. These include Xenosaga Freaks, a set of minigames set between the first two chapters, Xenosaga I II, a Nintendo DS remake of the first two chapters, and Xenosaga The Animation, an anime series covering the events of the first game. Episode I was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, Episode II was split between Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe, and Episode III was composed by Kajiura alone. Xenosaga Freaks reused some of the music of Episode I by Mitsuda while also including new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, while Xenosaga I II and Xenosaga The Animation used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita. Episode I sparked the release of two versions of its soundtrack album as well as a single, Episode II received two soundtrack albums, and Episode III received one. Xenosaga Freaks and Xenosaga The Animation each also sparked the release of a soundtrack album. In addition to the albums, Episode I saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music Episode II had only a book of piano sheet music. Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts, especially that of the first two games. The first episode in the series was Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht, released in 2002. Designed as a spiritual successor to Xenogears, the game was worked on by much of the same staff, including the composer Yasunori Mitsuda. For the game, Mitsuda composed a score that is mostly orchestral in nature, using the London Philharmonic Orchestra for several tracks. Other pieces include vocal tracks by the Metro Voices choir, piano solos by Yasuharu Nakanishi, and performances by the Gen Ittetsu Strings. The game's theme songs, Pain and Kokoro , were sung by Celtic singer Joanne Hogg of the band Iona, with whom Mitsuda had previously worked for the soundtrack to Xenogears. The vocal songs throughout the soundtrack range from choral to opera to a capella, while the tone of the soundtrack overall has been described as being serious, sometimes dark, heavy and even haunting at times . At one point in the development process, Mitsuda planned to use a separate person to orchestrate his compositions after an early piece proved unworkable and had to be scrapped, causing him to lose confidence in his own ability. After working for several months, however, he regained his confidence and decided to work as his own orchestrator, a decision which he feels improved him as a composer. The first release of the soundtrack as an album was the Xenosaga Original Soundtrack, released by DigiCube on March 6, 2002. The two disc album includes every piece from the game's soundtrack, with a total length of 1 58 42 across its 45 tracks. Two years later, on May 19, 2004, Mitsuda released another version of the soundtrack through his Sleigh Bells label titled Xenosaga Episode I. This version features two new tracks World to be Born and Pain piano version as well as re recordings of some of the tracks. The playlist order was also changed between the two versions, with Episode I grouping the tracks by style, rather than in rough chronological order within the game like the original album. Mitsuda explained in the liner notes for the album that he felt that separating the two styles presented a different impression of the music that allowed the listener to greater appreciate the atmosphere of the pieces. In addition to the two albums, a single, Kokoro , was released for the game's theme songs. Published by DigiCube, the disc includes Pain and Kokoro from the original soundtrack as well as a piano rendition of Kokoro and instrumental versions of both songs. The album has a total length of 23 55, and was released on February 6, 2002. The Original Soundtrack album reached 38 on the Japan Oricon charts and was well received by reviewers. IGN termed it one of Mitsuda's best soundtracks to date, calling it near genius with nearly every passing track . They especially praised the wide range of emotions present in the soundtrack. GameSpy agreed in their review of the game, saying that the music is rich, full, varied, and underscores the cinemas and battle sequences excellently . RPGFan, in their review of the Xenosaga Original Soundtrack album, said that the album works well as a stand alone album apart from the game, and that it has few, if any, bland or mediocre tracks. They repeated their praise for the soundtrack in their review of Xenosaga Episode I, though they felt that the two new tracks were not very impressive additions. Kokoro reached 61 and received praise as well, for its emotional intensity and lyrics. Original soundtrack track list Episode I track list The second episode of the series, Xenosaga Episode II Jenseits von Gut und Bose, was released in 2004. Mitsuda did not return to compose the soundtrack instead, Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe were brought into the project. Kajiura had previously composed for a few video games as well as numerous anime soundtracks. Her style for the game's soundtrack, for which she composed only the numerous cinematic scenes, has been described as a fusion of electronica and techno with either an orchestra or ethnic instruments, as well as including vocals in places where many composers would have left an instrumental section. Hosoe composed the music for the playable portions of the game, and feels that the sound quality and balance of the soundtrack is poor. This feeling is based primarily on the fact that he slashed the orchestral sound while creating the music so that the music played using the PlayStation 2's sound chip would match the music played off of the CD. He had predicted that there would be a fan outcry against changing composers on a series like Xenosaga , and suspects that his music from the game will never be released on an album to date the released albums for the game include only Kajiura's work. Kajiura and Hosoe did not collaborate on any of the tracks in Episode II according to Kajiura they never even met during the production. Episode II's soundtrack was first released as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II Jenseits Von Gut und Bose Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks and has a duration of 1 52 26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II Jenseits von Gut und Bose Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11 track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30 25. The Movie Scene album reached position 46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as it was more of a soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she found it easier to compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 14 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way. IGN, in their review of the game, said that the soundtrack for Episode II was not up to par with that of Episode I. They felt that Hosoe's tracks were in general too upbeat and poppy for the game's premise, and that while Kaijura's works were better, they were still weaker than Mitsuda's. One review from RPGamer agreed with this sentiment, calling the music on the whole pretty dull and unmemorable , though another RPGamer review praised the increase in the number of tracks present in the game, giving the listener greater variety. An RPGFan review of the Movie Scene album termed it a fantastic album , though one with several weak tracks and an aesthetic that would not appeal to many listeners, especially those who disliked vocal tracks. Their review of the promotional album gave that album high marks as well, saying that it was an excellent sampler album and, at the time, easy to find due to its inclusion in the game's strategy guide. Movie Scene soundtrack track list The third and final episode in the series, Xenosaga Episode III Also sprach Zarathustra, was released in 2006. Composed entirely by Kajiura, her style shifted from that of Episode II to be darker, with a larger focus on rhythm and less use of background vocals. The soundtrack has been described as melancholy and piano driven . Despite moving from composing only the cinematic tracks in Episode II to composing the whole score for Episode III, Kajiura says that the difficulty of each game's score was about the same. She primarily drew her inspiration for the music from the game's artwork and her conception of the world the game was set in. The only soundtrack album released for the game was Xenosaga III Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of selections from the soundtrack rather than all of the tracks. The two disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1 51 46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position 50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a sample that would only fill two discs. In RPGamer's review of the game, they termed the soundtrack a stunning success , saying that Kajiura provided an emotionally charged soundtrack that fit the tone of each section of the game and was superior to the soundtrack of Episode II. G4TV called the soundtrack a respectable contender and better than Episode II's soundtrack as well, praising the music's restraint and usage in accenting the game rather than overpowering it. IGN called it pretty darned good , though noted that it was not as good as the score to the first game. RPGFan, in their review of the album, said that while the quality of the overall work was better than that of Episode II's Movie Scene soundtrack album, the album was very inconsistent between great and poor tracks. They concluded that Kajiura had ultimately not succeeded in being Mitsuda's successor for the series. Best Tracks track list The spin off media of the Xenosaga series to include music are a collection of minigames titled Xenosaga Freaks that explores the backstory of Episode I, a remake of the first two episodes for the Nintendo DS titled Xenosaga I II, and an anime series titled Xenosaga The Animation. There are also other media adaptions without music, such as a manga series. Xenosaga Freaks included new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, while Xenosaga I II and Xenosaga The Animation used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita. Freaks sparked the release of an album, Xenosaga Freaks Reservation Privilege CD, which includes three vocal tracks sung by the voice actresses for the characters Shion, KOS MOS, and M.O.M.O. from the game, a fourth vocal track featuring all three of the singers, and a radio style interview with them. The 31 08 long album was released by Namco on April 28, 2004. The music, composed by Namco composers Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, is described as silly lighthearted techno pop , and very different from the music in the main games of the series. Xenosaga The Animation also received an album release, titled Xenosaga The Animation Original Soundtrack the 35 track album was released by Columbia Records on March 23, 2005. Music from the series was performed at the three show Passion concert series held in December 2006 by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra. The concerts included Pain from Episode I and Sakura from Episode II. Several tracks from Mitsuda and Kajiura's other works were also performed. An album, Passion, was produced by the orchestra for the concert, and included both of the Xenosaga songs. In the Eminence April 21, 2007 A Night in Fantasia 2007 concert, Gnosis , Zarathustra , and World to be Born from Episode I were played. Pain was again performed by a piano quintet from the Eminence Orchestra in their four show Destiny Reunion concert series in July 2007. Several other non Xenosaga pieces by Mitsuda and Kajiura were again also performed. In the Destiny Dreamer's Alliance album released for that concert series and others by the same quintet, Nephilim from Episode I, rather than Pain , was included. In addition to concerts, music from the series has been released as sheet music. On January 20, 2004, Mitsuda released Partitura Originale Di Xenosaga Episodio Uno Sheet Music, a book of orchestral sheet music for tracks from Episode I, through his record label Procyon Studio. The book contains 22 songs, composed and arranged by Mitsuda. In addition to that book, DOREMI Music Publishing published a book of piano sheet music, Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht Piano Solo Sheet Music. The book contains 21 songs, arranged by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos. DOREMI Music Publishing also published a book of piano sheet music for Episode II, Xenosaga Episode II Jenseits von Gut und Bose Piano Solo Sheet Music. The book contains 23 tracks, arranged by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos. Selections of remixes of music from the series appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music%20of%20Xenosaga
"Xenoturbella bocki is a marine benthic worm like species from the genus Xenoturbella. It is found in saltwater sea floor habitats off the coast of Europe, predominantly Sweden. It was the first species in the genus discovered. Initially it was collected by Swedish zoologist Sixten Bock in 1915, and described in 1949 by Swedish zoologist Einar Westblad. The unusual digestive structure of this species, in which a single opening is used to eat food and excrete waste, has led to considerable study and controversy as to its classification. It is a bottom dwelling, burrowing carnivore that eats mollusks likely larval forms, as opposed to hard shelled adults . For the genus name Xenoturbella, Ancient Greek xenos, means foreign or strange, and Latin turbela, means a bustle or turbulence in water. The species signifier bocki refers to Sixten Bock, who first collected the organism in 1915. It was assigned by Swedish zoologist Einar Westblad, who described the species in 1949. Swedish scientist Olle Israelsson gave Westblad's name to a population of X. bocki which he believed to be a distinct species, calling it X. westbladi. This is now a junior synonym for X. bocki. It is a member of sub phylum Xenoturbellida, which are known as paradoxmaskar Swedish for paradox worm a term that some popular media have applied to the species , because if it is classified as a deuterostome, it would be more closely related to humans than other, more complex, invertebrates such as lobsters. Deuterostomes are a superphylum of animals whose anus forms before their mouth does during embryonic development. It includes humans, other chordates, echinoderms and hemichordates. When it was discovered, X. bocki was placed in a new genus Xenoturbella. Above the genus level, the classification of this animal is controversial. Westbald placed it in the phylum Platyhelminthes in the class turbellaria free living flatworms . In 1999, based on genetic analysis, it was placed in protostoma by Israelsson, grouped with the bivalves. Protostoma is a large clade including worms, mollusks and arthropods. In embryonic development, their mouth develops prior to the development of the anus for most protostomes, though some have evolved other developmental pathways. If placed in this clade, Xenoturbella would also be among these exceptions. However, today, this is understood as a misclassification due to contaminating DNA from its shellfish food. Swedish scientist Sarah J. Bourlat and her coauthors in 2006 placed it in its own phylum, Xenoturbellida. More recent studies suggest on the basis of genetic and developmental evidence e.g. Hox genes that it should be grouped with Acoela and Nemertodermatida into Acoelomorpha. These three taxa are sometimes placed within the deuterostomes a large clade that includes humans and other chordates, sea stars and others , while others classify these organisms as a basal offshoot that resembles a common ancestor of deuterostomes and protostoma. A 2016 analysis of many genetic data sets supports the latter, and suggests that, like Xenoturbella bocki, the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes likely had one opening, ciliated locomotion and a wormlike body. However, if the deuterostome hypothesis is correct, then Xenoturbella must have lost many ancestral traits, such as an anus. In 1999 Israelsson examined specimens held at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and concluded that a small subset of them must belong to another species. This population differed from specimens Israelsson identified with X. bocki in its small size12 mm 0.47 in at mostpink colorationin contrast to yellow white coloration identified for X. bockiand positioning of gametes and sperm. Israelsson believed there was evidence of internal fertilization in this set of specimens. He named the species after Westblad, who collected the specimens. The specimens come from coarser and shallower habitats in the same range as X. bocki. American scientist Greg Rouse and collegues sequenced mitochondrial DNA from specimens identified with both species and, on the basis of this, determined that the two populations were the same species, declaring X. westbladi to be a junior synonym to X. bocki. This animal usually grows to 1 cm 0.39 in in length, though individuals as long as 4 cm 1.6 in have been reported. Its nervous system consists of a nerve net with no defined brain or ganglia. The nerve net is found on the basal away from the animal's surface side of the skin. This animal lacks an anus, excreting waste through the same opening as it intakes food. Thus, the digestive organ is sac like. The opening is on the belly of the animal, near the front. A furrow runs along the circumference of the body in the middle of the animal. There are also side furrows. It lacks a coelom. On its sides there are numerous tiny cilia that aid in locomotion. Small cells contain vesicles which may act as glands. An organ of unknown function, preliminarily called a statocyst, has been observed on the front end of the animal. Two leading hypotheses are that it aids in balance, as statocysts do in other invertebrates, or that it has endocrine functions. Experiments in which the animal was observed to cleave into two after a wound show that the statocyst is essential for normal behavior and long term survival. The animal moves through the water via rhythmic muscle contraction, aided by its side cilia, and a tuft of longer cilia on its back. The organism can also use its musculature to roll up into a ball, and maintain that form for several months. Adults are known to have a symbiotic relationship with bacterial species. Genetic data confirms that its diet includes bivalve mollusks. However, it has never been observed feeding, so it is unknown if it eats bivalve carcasses, eggs, sperm, mucus, feces, or live larval or adult bivalves. It lacks any visible means to get through the shells of adult bivalves. Captive specimens survived for several months without food, and showed no interest in any of the proposed food items afterwards. This has led some to suggest that it feeds by absorbing dissolved organic matter through its skin. At least one specimen that has been proposed to show a consumed bivalve larvae is preserved in the Swedish Natural History Museum. This species burrows, and has been observed to make tunnels as deep as 15 cm 5.9 in into substrate in a laboratory aquarium. This species has been found in ocean habitats off the coast of Europe, most often off the coast of Sweden. It is often collected using a Warens dredge from mud on the sea floor, at depths of 50200 m 160660 ft . X. bocki has only been observed to reproduce sexually. In the wild, this species spawns in the winter. It lays small, mucus coated eggs, which sink in the water column. The eggs have a pale orange color, and are opaque. Young, upon hatching, are yellowish, nearly spherical, and move to the surface of the water. Larvae lack a blastopore and do not feed until they are fully developed. They may derive nourishment from the yolk which would make them lecithotrophic. Within five days muscular contractions are observed in a laboratory setting, which may aid locomotion. X. bocki is a direct developer. As of 2013, this animal is extremely challenging to grow in captivity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoturbella%20bocki
"Ceriomyces zelleri Murrill 1912 Boletus zelleri Murrill Murrill 1912 Xerocomus zelleri Murrill Snell 1944 Boletellus zelleri Murrill Singer, Snell E.A.Dick 1960 Xerocomellus zelleri, commonly known as Zeller's Bolete, is an edible species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores on the underside of the caps, and the red streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in Douglas fir forests or on their margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. Xerocomellus zelleri was first described by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he found on the campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would be more appropriate in the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus. The specific epithet zelleri was chosen by Murrill to honor Professor Sanford Myron Zeller, mycologist at Oregon State University. Zeller accompanied Murrill in his Seattle expedition, and discovered the first specimens of the mushroom. The cap is typically between 512 cm 2.04.7 in in diameter, initially convex but flattening somewhat in maturity. It is fleshy, with an uneven velvety surface, and dark brown to nearly black the margin of the cap is a pale cream color. Young specimens are covered by a grayish bloom. The tubes that comprise the undersurface of the cap the hymenium are up to 1.5 cm 0.6 in long and angular, yellow, becoming dirty yellow and finally greenish yellow there are 12 pores per millimeter on the hymenium surface. They do not change color when bruised, although they may turn slightly brownish when exposed to the air for a time. The flesh is yellow to dirty yellow, up to 1.5 cm 0.6 in thick, and inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken. The stem is up to 10 cm 3.9 in tall, 12.5 cm 0.41.0 in thick, and swollen toward the base. The stem surface is red or yellowish with red lines, often white or yellow at the base, and solid that is, not hollow , with fibrous flesh in maturity the stem ages to yellowish red to dark red. The spore print is olive brown one source notes that creating a spore print may result in a lot of yellow juice on the paper . The spores are ellipsoid in shape, smooth, and have dimensions of 1216 by 46 m, although occasionally there will be some giant spores with lengths of up to 24 m. The basidia, the spore bearing cells, are 2635 by 9.512 m, and four spored. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical and thin walled, with dimensions of 3877 by 5.514.8 m. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae. The fruit body tissue stains a greenish color when a drop of ammonia solution is applied. Xerocomellus zelleri is an edible species, although care should be taken to ensure that specimens collected for consumption are free of fly larvae. In his book 100 Edible Mushrooms, Michael Kuo gave the mushroom an edibility rating of mediocre . There is no distinguishable odor, and the taste is alternately described as pleasant, mild, or slightly acidic . The original species description noted that the texture was slightly mucilaginous . The mushroom is suitable for preserving or drying, or as a filler to add bulk to a dish. It is harvested and sold commercially in local markets in British Columbia, Canada. The red cracked bolete Xerocomellus chrysenteron has an olive brown cap that cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, found only in eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked cap with pale exposed flesh. In 1914, Zeller published a study of the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae at the top of the stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins the hymenium forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center. The mushrooms originate as minute fruit bodies called pins due to their shape from a yellow mycelium that forms a mat and tends to engulf pine needles. The pins, typically 12 mm in diameter, lengthen vertically until they are roughly three or four times longer than they are thick. Until this point, the fruit body is a homogenous mass of tissue. It differentiates simultaneously into cap and stem along a cleavage plane an axis along which any cell division occurs from the outside inward, which gives rise to deep furrow encircling the fruit body. The hymenium is formed in the roof of this furrow, growing inward and upward from the outside edge. The cap develops from the upper section of this division, the stem from the lower. This species grows solitarily or in small groups on the ground or in forest duff in mature coniferous forests, occasionally abundant on grassy edges of the forest, rarely on badly decayed conifer logs. It is an ectomycorrhizal mushroom, meaning that the fungal hyphae form sheaths around the rootlets of certain trees, exchanging nutrients with them in a mutualistic relationship. The fungus associates with alder, poplar and other hardwoods, and has been shown in laboratory culture to form ectomycorrhizae with Western Hemlock Tsuga heterophylla . However, the fungus may have saprobic tendencies, as it has been noted to grow under California Redwood sometimes in the rotted wood of old trunks , a tree not known to form mycorrizhae. It is known to form long rhizomorphs aggregations of hyphae that resemble roots , and has been noted to be more abundant in sites with buried wood than without. In British Columbia, it occurs from summer to early winter, although it also appears infrequently in early spring. In California, the mushroom often fruits after the rainy period in autumn through to March or April. The dark coloring of the cap make this species difficult to notice, unless a glimpse of the yellow hymenium is obtained . Fruit bodies are eaten by the American shrew mole. Xerocomellus zelleri is distributed in North America in the Pacific Northwest south to California and Mexico. In Mexico, it has been reported in high altitude cloud forests of Mexican Beech Fagus mexicana , a rare and endangered habitat. It has also been reported from Tibet, but this may be based on a misidentification. Xerocomellus zelleri has been shown to contain the phenethylamine alkaloid compounds tyramine, N methyltyramine, and hordenine, although the chemotaxonomic significance of this is not clear.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerocomellus%20zelleri
"Xevious is a 1983 vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco. It was licensed to Atari, Inc. for release in North America. The player controls a starship known as the Solvalou , in its efforts to combat the Xevious forces. The Solvalou has two weapons a projectile that can destroy flying enemies, and bombs that can be used to destroy ground based enemies. It ran on the Namco Galaga arcade board. Xevious was created by Masanobu Endo, being his first project for Namco. Commissioned by the company's marketing team to rival the success of Konami's Scramble, the game was originally titled Cheyenne and set during the Vietnam War, with the player controlling a small helicopter. Following the departure of staff, a more science fiction theme was applied to the game, featuring large, elaborate structures and mechanical starships. Several enemy types were made as homages to other science fiction works, including Battlestar Galactica, UFO and Star Wars. Xevious is credited as one of the first video games to feature a boss fight, pre rendered graphics, and a storyline, along with being the first arcade game to spawn a television commercial, courtesy of Atari. It became an overwhelming success for Namco in Japan, selling as many units as Space Invaders in its first few weeks of release. International releases were less of a success. Japanese audiences cite Xevious as one of the most influential video games of the genre, setting the template for future games to follow, such as Zanac, Raiden and RayForce. Its success would lead to the creation of several sequels and spin offs, strategy guides, literature, soundtrack albums, and an animated feature film. Xevious is a vertical scrolling shooter video game. The player controls a starship known as the Solvalou to destroy the Xevious forces, who plot to take over Earth. The Solvalou has two weapons for combating enemies an air zapper that fires projectiles at flying enemies, and a blaster bomb for destroying enemies stationed on the ground. The Solvalou also has a blaster receptacle which will determine where the bombs will go to, used to destroy ground targets. Certain areas of the game will have a fight against the Andor Genesis mothership, which will launch an endless stream of projectiles and explosive black spheres known as Zakatos . The player can either destroy all four blaster receptacles or simply destroy the core in the center to defeat it. Some parts of the game will have hidden towers known as Sol Citadels , which can be found by bombing specific parts of an area these areas will cause the Solvalou's receptacle to flash red when flown over. Yellow Special Flags from Namco's own Rally X are also found in a random section of the area collecting it will award the player an extra life. The game has a total of sixteen stages, known as areas in game, which will loop back to the first after completing them all. Dying about 70 through an area will allow the player to start at the beginning of the next. These areas have large geographical features, such as forests, sand roads, rivers and mechanical structures certain areas will also have Nazca lines placed on the ground, notably the condor design. The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type will replace it this can be reverted by destroying flashing red Zolback radars found on the ground, which will cause the more advanced enemies to instead be replaced with easier ones. Masanobu Endo joined Namco in April 1981 as a planner, following the release of Rally X. At the time, Konami released their game Scramble into arcades, credited as one of the earliest horizontal scrolling shooter video games. Taking note of the game's success, Namco's marketing department would assign Endo and a team of others to create a two button shoot em up game to compete against it, which would later become Xevious Early versions of the game were known as Cheyenne, taking place during the Vietnam War and having the player controlling a small helicopter. A personnel reshuffling and the lead planner departing from the project made Endo the game's head designer. Endo would learn programming on the job during the project. Namco graphic and logo artist Hiroshi Mr. Dotman Ono would design the sprite for the player's ship, the Solvalou, as well as many of the game's background designs. The game was programmed to start off easy for newer players, gradually becoming more difficult as the player becomes better at the game. Many of the enemies were designed by artist Shigeki Toiyama, originally the head of Namco's former robotics division Xevious would be the first video game project he would work on. Several enemies in the game would pay as homages to starships from other popular science fiction films and series, such as UFO, Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars. The Solvalou ship drew inspiration to the Nostromo starcraft from the film Alien. Original designs for the Andor Genesis mothership were much more round than the finalized design this circular version was nicknamed Gofuru , for its resemblance to Gofuru cookies. Due to hardware limitations, the design of the ship was changed to be the shape of an octagon whilst still retaining many of the original features, such as the visible core and receptacles. The name Xevious was originally titled Zevious, with the X being added to make it sound more exotic, similar to the name Xerox. The game's metallic logo was created as a homage to the pinball table Xenon. Xevious was first released in Japan in January 1983. In the following months, Atari would acquire the rights from Namco to distribute the game outside of Japan. Xevious would receive a number of home ports for both game consoles and personal computers, such as the Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X68000, Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 7800 and ZX Spectrum. A port for the Atari 2600 was completed but never released. The Nintendo Entertainment System Family Computer version, published in 1984, was one of the earliest third party releases for the system copies would sell out within three days of initial shipment, while Namco phone lines would become flooded with calls from players in need of gameplay tips. This port would later be re released for the Famicom Disk System in 1990. Xevious would be included in a number of Namco video game compilations, such as Namco Museum Vol. 2 1996 , Namco Museum 50th Anniversary 2005 , Namco Museum Remix 2007 , Namco Museum DS 2007 and Namco Museum Essentials 2009 . The 2005 GameCube game Star Fox Assault includes the NES release as a bonus game by collecting all silver medals in the game. Digital releases of the game were added to the Xbox Live Arcade in 2007 and the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. A remake of the game was released under the 3D Classics brand in 2011, titled 3D Classics Xevious, for the Nintendo 3DS. The NES version of the game was digitally released over to the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013. To celebrate the game's 30th anniversary in 2011, a digital version of the game was released for iOS devices as part of the Namco Arcade game compilation. In 2015, Xevious and several other Namco video game properties were made available to Japanese developers under the Catalog IP Project , where developers could use characters from Namco video games in mobile and web browser games. Xevious was an overwhelming success for Namco in Japan. In its first few weeks of release, it had sold almost as many units as Space Invaders. The Famicom port of the game sold 1.26 million copies, making it the console's first killer app . However, the arcade version under performed in North America, selling 5,295 units by the end of 1983. Xevious was met with critical acclaim, cited as one of the greatest games of the vertical scrolling shooter game genre. Many would refer to it as the father of vertical scrolling shooter video games, paving the way for future titles such as Zanac, Twin Bee, Raiden and RayForce. In 1997, readers of Gamest magazine voted Xevious the second greatest arcade game of all time, wining the Best Game Award of that year, applauding the game's graphics, music, gameplay and historical significance. Next Generation listed the arcade version at number 90 in their Top 100 Games of All Time in 1996, praising the intense action , variety of enemies, art direction, level design and layer of strategy. Japanese gaming magazine Yuge ranked the Famicom version one of the greatest games made for the platform. Xevious is also credited for being one of the first video games to have a boss fight, pre rendered game graphics and a storyline. Modern digital re releases would be met with mostly mixed reviews. In their review for the Wii Virtual Console release of the NES version, Nintendo Life referred to the game as dated and criticizing its graphical quality and sound effects. Both IGN and GameSpot would criticize the lack of improvements and bonus features in the Xbox Live Arcade version, although would give a positive response to the emulation quality and online leaderboards. X One Magazine UK simply concluded their review of the XBLA release with It's a piece of crap. Reviewing the Wii U Virtual Console NES port, Nintendo Life was more positive, calling it a solid and very straightforward port of an arcade classic. The success of Xevious would lead to a number of sequels and spin offs being produced. The first of these, Super Xevious, was released in 1984 the difficulty was increased to appeal to more advanced players, alongside new enemy types and characters that will reset the player's score when shot. A similarly titled game was released in 1986 for the Family Computer, Super Xevious GAMP no Nazo, which intermixed puzzle elements with the standard Xevious gameplay. An arcade version of this game was also released, known as Vs. Super Xevious, running on the Nintendo Vs. arcade system. An arcade spin off title starring one of the enemies from Xevious, Grobda, was released in 1984. Two games for the MSX2 and PC Engine were released in 1988 and 1990 respectively Xevious Fardraut Saga and Xevious Fardraut Densetsu, both of which include a remade port of the original alongside a brand new story mode with new enemies, boss fights and power up items. A 3D rail shooter spin off, Solvalou, was published in 1991. In 1995, two arcade sequels were released Xevious Arrangement, a remake of the original with two player co op, and Xevious 3D G, a 3D game with 2D gameplay both of these titles were soon released in 1997 for the PlayStation, compiled into Xevious 3D G , alongside the original Xevious and Super Xevious. A final follow up title was released in 2009, Xevious Resurrection, exclusively as part of the compilation title Namco Museum Essentials, which includes two player simultaneous co op alongside a number of other features. In 1991, a three part Xevious novel was published, titled Fardraut the books documented the lore of the Xevious video game series, including its characters, backstory and events. The books would be republished fifteen years later in 2005. A 2002 CGI film adaptation was released in Japan, produced during a collaboration between Namco and Japanese company Groove Corporation. A Xevious themed soundtrack album was produced by Haruomi Hosono of Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1984, titled Video Game Music. Compiled with music from other Namco video games, such as Mappy and Pole Position, it is credited as the first video game soundtrack album. Xevious would also spawn the first gameplay recording for a video game and the first television commercial for an arcade game. Music from the game was used during the video game themed television series Starcade.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xevious
"Xevious 3D G is a 1996 vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco. It is the eighth entry in the Xevious video game series and the second to use 3D graphics, following Solvalou 1991 . In the game, the player mans a starship known as the Solvalou that must destroy the Xevious forces and their leader GAMP before they enslave all of mankind. The Solvalou has a projectile and bomb for respectively destroying air and ground based enemies, and can collect power up icons to upgrade its abilities. It ran on the Namco System 11 arcade board. Music for the arcade game was composed by Ayako Saso and Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Dragon Spirit and Ridge Racer additional tracks were composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Hiroto Sasaki. A PlayStation version was released a year later in 1997, titled Xevious 3D G and included ports of the original Xevious, Super Xevious and Xevious Arrangement. It was met with mixed reviews upon release, being praised for its graphics, soundtrack and gameplay but criticized for its short length and low difficulty. 3D G was digitally re released for the PlayStation Store in 2013 under the Game Archives brand and later in North America in 2015 as part of the PSOne Classics range. Xevious 3D G is a vertical scrolling shooter video game featuring 3D graphics integrated with 2D gameplay. Up to two players control their respective Solvalou starships blue for player one and red for player two that must destroy the Xevious forces and their leader before they enslave all of mankind. The Solvalou has two weapons at its disposal a projectile that can destroy air based enemies, and a bomb that can destroy ground stationed enemies. New to this game are power up items, found in cylindrical stations called Poladomes on the ground that must be bombed to acquire it these include a blue double shot, a green concentrated light beam that cuts through enemies, and a red heat seeing laser that locks onto any enemy it finds on the screen. The game consists of seven stages, or areas , including grassy plateaus, large oceans, mechanical bases and outer space. Each area also features a boss that must be defeated in order to progress, including the Andor Genesis mothership from the original Xevious. The final stage features a fight with GAMP, the supercomputer leader of the Xevious forces. Much like the first game, large Sol towers can be found by bombing pre determined spots on the ground, alongside Rally X Special Flags that award an extra life when collected. Many references to other Namco games are featured in the game as easter eggs, including a Pooka from the Dig Dug series and a cheat code that replaces both player's Solvalou with Heihachi and Paul from Tekken, featuring their own ending sequences. Xevious 3D G was released in arcades by Namco in May 1996 for Japan and later on in 1996 for North America. Music for the game was composed by Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Dragon Spirit and Ridge Racer, and Ayako Saso, along with additional contributions from Nobuyoshi Sano and Hiroto Sasaki. A PlayStation version, titled Xevious 3D G , was released in Japan on March 28, 1997, in North America on June 30, 1997, and in Europe later on in 1997 alongside 3D G, the game also includes the original Xevious, Super Xevious and Xevious Arrangement, the last of which was previously released for arcades as part of Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1. 3D G also features a new soundtrack by Hiroto Sasaki along with contributions from other composers. The player could use the Namco NeGcon controller to control the Solvalou. The original Japanese release featured heavy slowdown, which was corrected in the North American release. 3D G was digitally re released onto the PlayStation Store for both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in Japan on June 26, 2013, followed by a North American release on February 24, 2015. The PlayStation version of Xevious 3D G specifically was met with mixed reviews, with common complaints being towards the game's short length and low difficulty. It holds a 69 on aggregator website GameRankings, and was awarded the Silver Hall of Fame award from Japanese publication Famitsu. Both GameSpot and Next Generation stated that the game offered little value for its price, criticizing the game's short length and low difficulty setting, with GameSpot in particular saying it could be finished in a single day. Electronic Gaming Monthly compared the inclusion of the other Xevious games to that of a Cracker Jack prize, saying they're nice to have in there, but you're not really going to play with it , and that they didn't make the game worth the purchase. EGM also said the game had too few power up items to make it standout among other similar games. GameSpot noted that the inclusion of the arcade games were more of a necessity after playing the game for a while. Critics praised the game's graphics and modern soundtrack, and for keeping the core Xevious gameplay intact. Next Generation said that the game was a lot of fun while it lasted, simultaneously praising its graphics and music. . GamePro praised it for keeping the original gameplay of Xevious and the included arcade games, concluding with While it may not be the perfect PlayStation shooter, 3D G's heritage and plentiful gaming options make it a winner. IGN was the most positive towards it for the arcade games, outstanding graphics and soundtrack, labeling it a must own for shoot'em up fans on the system. GameSpot had a similar response, saying the music and graphics made for a decent title, recommending it to fans of the original Xevious and similar old school games. In a retrospective review, Hardcore Gaming 101 commented that the soundtrack alone made the game worth playing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xevious%203D/G
"Xgrid is a proprietary program and distributed computing protocol developed by the Advanced Computation Group subdivision of Apple Inc that allows networked computers to contribute to a single task. It provides network administrators a method of creating a computing cluster, which allows them to exploit previously unused computational power for calculations that can be divided easily into smaller operations, such as Mandelbrot maps. The setup of an Xgrid cluster can be achieved at next to no cost, as Xgrid client is pre installed on all computers running Mac OS X 10.4 to Mac OS X 10.7. The Xgrid client was not included in Mac OS X 10.8. The Xgrid controller, the job scheduler of the Xgrid operation, is also included within Mac OS X Server and as a free download from Apple. Apple has kept the command line job control mechanism minimalist while providing an API to develop more sophisticated tools built around it. The program employs its own communication protocol layered on top of a schema to communicate to other nodes. This communication protocol interfaces with the BEEP infrastructure, a network application protocol framework. Computers discovered by the Xgrid system, that is computers with Mac OS X's Xgrid service enabled, are automatically added to the list of available computers to use for processing tasks. When the initiating computer sends the complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The design of the Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer. Apple modeled the design of Xgrid on the Zilla program, distributed with NeXT's OPENSTEP operating system application programming interface API , which Apple owned the rights to. The company also opted to provide the client version of Mac OS X with only command line functions and little flexibility, while giving the Mac OS X Server version of Xgrid a GUI control panel and a full set of features. Xgrid's original concept can be traced back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end user operating system and which used the idle screen saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award Science Category in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004. Several organizations have adopted Xgrid in large international computing networks. One example of an Xgrid cluster is MacResearch's OpenMacGrid, where scientists can request access to large amounts of processing power to run tasks related to their research. Another was the now defunct Xgrid Stanford project, which used a range of computers on the Stanford University campus and around the world to perform biochemical research. In a pre release promotional piece, MacWorld cited Xgrid among the Unix features in 10 Things to Know about TIGER , calling it handy if you work with huge amounts of experimental data or render complex animations . After Xgrid's introduction in 2004, InfoWorld noted that it was a 'preview' grade technology which would directly benefit from the Xserve G5's launch later that year. InfoWorld commentator Ephraim Schwartz also predicted that Xgrid was an opening move in Apple's entry into the enterprise computing market. Apple discontinued Xgrid with OS X v10.8 Mountain Lion , along with dependent services such as Podcast Producer. The Xgrid protocol uses the BEEP network framework to communicate with nodes on the network. The system's infrastructure includes three types of computers which communicate over the protocol. One is the client, which communicates the calculation. Next is the controller, which starts and segregates the calculation. Finally, the agents process their own allocated part of the calculation. A computer can act as one or all three of these components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps. Within the Xgrid protocol, three types of messages can be passed to other computers on the same cluster requests, notifications and replies. Requests must be responded to by the recipient with a reply, notifications do not require a reply, and replies are responses to sent messages. They are identified by their name, type request notification reply and contents. Each message is encapsulated in a BEEP message BEEP MSG and is acknowledged on receipt by an empty reply RPY . Xgrid does not leverage BEEPs message reply infrastructure. Any received message which requires a response merely generates an independent BEEP message containing the reply. The Xgrid messages are encoded as dictionaries of key value pairs which are converted to XML before being sent across the BEEP network. The architecture of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system is known as a job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks. The controller is central to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete. Xgrid is layered upon the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol BEEP , an IETF standard comparable to HTTP, but with a focus on two way multiplexed communication, such as that found in peer to peer networks. BEEP, in turn, uses XML to define profiles for communicating between multiple agents over a single network or internet connection. While it is possible to access Xgrid from the command line, the Xgrid graphical user interface, a program bundled with Mac OS X Server and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all Mac OS X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of Mac OS X Server. This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with Mac OS X Server. Despite the lack of a graphical controller interface in the standard non server Mac OS X distribution, it is possible to set up an Xgrid controller via the command line tools xgridctl and xgrid. Once the Xgrid controller daemon is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin tool is possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xgrid
"Emin Xhinovci also spelled Gjinovci, Djinovci and Dzinovci born c. 1959 is a retired Kosovo Liberation Army KLA insurgent and restaurant owner from Mitrovica known for his striking resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. He immigrated to Germany in 1993 and settled in Dusseldorf, where he started an import export business. In 1997, he returned to Kosovo and later joined the KLA with the intention of helping separate the region from Yugoslavia. During his time as a guerrilla, he came to be known by the nickname Hitler because of his likeness to the Nazi leader. Following the Kosovo War, he settled in Mitrovica and opened a string of Nazi themed restaurants that angered some NATO peacekeepers and were quickly closed. Xhinovci firmly believes that he is Hitler reincarnated and resorted to portraying the Nazi leader full time in his public life, posing for pictures with locals, peacekeepers and tourists and charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph. He is well known throughout Mitrovica, and his five daughters are referred to by locals as Hitler's children . Xhinovci always carries a copy of Hitler's autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf with him and is frequently paid to attend events such as weddings and funerals. He is the subject of a short documentary film directed by independent filmmaker Alban Muja, titled Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me. A Kosovo Albanian, Emin Xhinovci was born in Kosovska Mitrovica in 1959, in what was then Yugoslavia. In 1993, he moved to the German city of Dusseldorf, where he started an import export business. He left Germany in 1997 and returned to Kosovo to fight for the motherland as tensions between Albanians and Serbs increased. Xhinovci joined the Kosovo Liberation Army Albanian Ushtria Clirimtare e Kosoves or KLA in 1998, and fought against the Serb dominated Yugoslav Army Serbian Vojska Jugoslavije with the goal of separating Kosovo from Yugoslavia. Xhinovci earned the reputation of a fierce fighter and commanded the respect of local Albanians. His comrades gave him the nickname Hitler due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Xhinovci told journalist Una Hajdari People have called me Hitler since my army days. They say I look a lot like himunlike the English guy who plays him in that movie, apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin's role in The Great Dictator. Serbian police documents from 1998 indicate that he was suspected of participating in the kidnapping and execution of nine Serb mineworkers at the Belacevac coal mine, near Obilic. In 1999, Xhinovci was wounded in battle and airlifted to Germany for treatment. While in hospital, he grew a toothbrush moustache which attracted the attention of hospital staff. Following his experience with the German hospital staff, Xhinovci realized that he could capitalize on his resemblance to Hitler. He went to great lengths to enhance his physical likeness to the Nazi leaderregularly clipping his moustache, dying his hair jet black and imitating Hitler's signature hairstyle. When the war in Kosovo ended, Xhinovci returned to Mitrovica and opened a bar called Bar Hit and Jet, known affectionately among Kosovo Albanians as Pizzeria Hitleri Hitler's Pizzeria . The establishment proved controversial among western peacekeepers who had occupied Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces in June 1999. In one instance, French NATO troops took down a sign carrying a swastika from the entrance to Xhinovci's bar, much to his displeasure. One French commander told reporters that he was disgusted with Xhinovci's actions and said that his troops were forbidden from entering the bar, which juxtaposed Nazi imagery with portraits of Xhinovci in KLA uniform. Asked why he enjoyed dressing up as Hitler, Xhinovci responded Everyone who is against the people who carried out bloodshed against is a friend of mine , apparently referring to the German led Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, when German forces turned a blind eye to Albanian raids on Serb populated areas of Kosovo. He conceded that Hitler had gone too far by killing women and children, but said that it would be a good idea to eliminate all those who thirst for our blood . Within several years, Xhinovci was forced to close Pizzeria Hitleri because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization's image. Like many in post war Kosovo, he encountered great financial difficulties and relied on his KLA service pension and financial assistance from relatives in Western Europe. Once his financial situation stabilized, Xhinovci opened a restaurant and named it Jehona after his oldest daughter. All of the restaurant's receipts were stamped with a black swastika in the upper left corner. The restaurant closed a few years after its opening for reasons unknown. Emin Xhinovci Following the closure of Pizzeria Hitleri and Jehona, Xhinovci has resorted to walking around Mitrovica dressed as Hitler and posing for pictures with locals, tourists and NATO peacekeepers, charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph. Some days, he earns as many as 200 euros posing as Hitler. Besides posing for photographs, Xhinovci attends various events, including weddings and funerals, and greets attendees with a Nazi salute. sometimes has an undesirable effect because people who've come to pay their respects to the deceased often wish to speak with me and take pictures, Xhinovci explains. Xhinovci has come to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began dressing as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi era Reichsmarks, swastika emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word Hitler printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersbyincluding some NATO peacekeepersstop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News I have a lot of other things to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it. Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living shows great enterprise . People respect me, Xhinovci explains. The young and old ... men, women and children. Everyone greets me with Heil Hitler . Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as Hitler's children , are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous personshe doesn't mind. Xhinovci is unable to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which prohibit Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says that he would have to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies. About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him. Xhinovci is a controversial figure in some Kosovar circles. Kosova Aktuell, a Pristina based German language newspaper, called his actions scandalous and unacceptable . In 2013, Kosovar filmmaker Alban Muja created a short documentary film about Xhinovci titled Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me, which chronicles Xhinovci's everyday activities and follows him around Mitrovica as he interacts with locals.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin%20Xhinovci
"The fortifications of Xi'an Chinese , also known as Xi'an City Wall, in Xi'an, an ancient capital of China, represent one of the oldest, largest and best preserved Chinese city walls. It was built under the rule of the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang as a military defense system. It exhibits the complete features of the rampart architecture of feudal society . It has been refurbished many times since it was built in the 14th century, thrice at intervals of about 200 years in the later half of the 1500s and 1700s, and in recent years in 1983. The wall encloses an area of about 14 square kilometres 5.4 sq mi The Xi'an City Wall is on the tentative list of UNESCO's World Heritage Site under the title City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties . Since 2008, it is also on the list of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China. Since March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall is a heritage National Historical and Cultural Unit. Xi'an City Wall is located in the urban district of Xi'an City, which at one time was an imperial city during the periods of the Sui and Tang dynasties. It is situated at the end of the ancient Silk Road. Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty 13681644 , was advised by Zhu Sheng, a sage, to build a fortified high wall around the city, create storage facilities for food and then establish his empire by unifying all the other states. Following the hermit's advice, Zhu established the Ming dynasty, and then built a highly fortified wall over a previously existing palace wall of the Tang dynasty 618907 . He started building the Xian City Wall, as the capital of northwestern Shaanxi Province in 1370. He incorporated the ancient fortified embankments built by the Sui and Tang dynasties by including them in the wall's western and southern parts, enlarging the eastern and northern parts. The edifice was built over an eight year period and was well maintained during both the Ming dynasty, and the Qing dynasty, which followed. The wall was initially built solely from tamped earth. During the Longqing Emperor's period 1568 the wall was strengthened by laying blue bricks on the top and exterior faces of the earthen walls. During the reign of Qianlong of the Qing dynasty 1781 , the wall was enlarged drainage features, crenels and other modifications were made and the structure as it is now seen came into existence. By the end of the Qing dynasty rule, the structure had begun to deteriorate. In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of the wall, which was in a poor state. In the first decade of the 20th century, the wall's defense system was considered to be of strategic importance, even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution. In 1926, the wall was attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage, but the city within the wall was not affected. During the Second World War, when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940, the residents built around 1,000 bunkers, as anti aircraft shelters within the wide base thickness of more than 15 metres 49 ft of the wall. A few escape openings were also made through the wall as passageways. Even later, new gates to allow traffic through the Xian Wall were constructed during the Republican rule. According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s most people lived within the perimeter of the Xi'an Wall but still there were a lot of unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain later general Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Prusek 19061980 in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter connected. The Xi'an City Wall was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China in 2008. UNESCO included the site in the tentative List of World Heritage Sites under the title City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties as a cultural heritage designee under Criterion iii iv. In March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall was fully approved as a heritage site as a National Historical and Cultural Town. Michelle Obama, the first lady of the United States, visited the Xi'an City Wall on 24 March 2014, describing it as a wall that has withstood war and famine and the rise and fall of dynasties . The Xi'an Wall is rectangular in shape and has a total length of 14 kilometres 8.7 mi , with almost all stretches subjected to some kind of restoration or rebuilding. Along the top of the wall is a walkway, which would typically take four hours to cover. It is built in the Chinese architecture style. As a defense fortification, it was constructed with a moat, drawbridges, watch towers, corner towers, parapet walls and gate towers. The wall is 12 metres 39 ft in height with a width of 1214 metres 3946 ft at the top and base width of 1518 metres 4959 ft . Ramparts are built at intervals of 120 metres 390 ft , projecting from the main wall. There are parapets on the outer side of the wall, built with 5,984 crenels, which form altogether protruding ramparts . There are four watch towers, located at the corners and the moat that surrounds the wall has a width of 18 metres 59 ft and depth of 6 metres 20 ft . The area within the wall is about 36 square kilometres 14 sq mi , enclosing the small area of 14 square kilometres 5.4 sq mi occupied by the city. The southern embrasured watchtower constructed in 1378, was destroyed by fire in 1926 during the civil war of 1926, and was restored in September 2014. This was done after a careful historical review of documents related to the historical features that existed before it was damaged. The other three watchtowers forming the northern, eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower. They were modified, without affecting the integrity of the wall, by an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel, wood work and the ancient type tiles and bricks structure. Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls. There is an Archery Tower , which provides security to one of the four gates of the Xi'an wall. Created as a large trap like chamber, capped by a tower filled with windows, it gave an advantageous position for archers to shoot arrows in the initial years of building the wall and later cannonballs at the opposing revolutionary forces. In the event that the enemy was able to breach the walls through the main gate they would become trapped in the small chamber that faced yet another gate and thus be easy targets for the defending troops.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications%20of%20Xi%27an

"Xin Fengxia Chinese WadeGiles Hsin Feng hsia 1927 12 April 1998 was a Chinese pingju opera performer, known as the Queen of Pingju . She was also a film actress, writer, and painter. She starred in the highly popular films Liu Qiao'er 1956 and Flowers as Matchmakers 1964 , both adapted from her operas. Xin was married to Wu Zuguang, a prominent playwright and an outspoken critic of government policies. When Wu was denounced as a rightist in Mao Zedong's Anti Rightist Campaign, Xin refused to divorce him and was herself denounced as a result. She was later severely persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, becoming disabled after a beating and was later paralyzed due to a stroke. No longer able to perform, she dedicated the remainder of her life to teaching, writing, and painting. She studied painting with her godfather Qi Baishi, a master of Chinese painting, and studied writing with her husband. She published a two million word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Xin Fengxia pioneered her own style of pingju, now called the Xin which also means new style. It has become one of the most important styles of the opera. In 2014, the China Pingju Institute created the new pingju opera Xin Fengxia to commemorate her life. Xin Fengxia was born in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. When she was a toddler she was sold by human smugglers to Tianjin in northern China, and was given the name Yang Shumin . She was trained as an opera performer from a young age. At that time, the theatrical world in China was controlled by gangsters. Actors, even renowned performers, had little personal freedom. She originally trained for Peking opera under her older sister Yang Jinxiang, but later changed to pingju. She toured extensively, and by the 1940s, her fame had rivalled well known female stars such as Liu Cuixia, Bai Yushuang, and Fu Ronghua. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Xin moved to Beijing. Her first performance, in the modern pingju Little Erhei's Marriage, was well liked and attracted the attention of the original novelist Zhao Shuli and the well known writer Lao She. Her next performance, in Liu Qiao'er, was even more successful, making her a household name in China. In the opera Flowers as Matchmakers Hua Wei Mei , she transformed the traditional melancholy tunes of pingju into joyous ones, and enriched the pingju repertoire by creating many new melodies. It is now considered a classic of the Xin style pingju. Liu Qiao'er was made into a film in 1956, which was followed by Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964. Both starred Xin and were extremely popular. Premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao were both her fans. Zhou once said I can live without tea for three days, but not without watching Xin Fengxia. In 1951, Lao She introduced Xin Fengxia to the famous playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, despite the fact that they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter. Wu Zuguang, an outspoken critic of government cultural policies, was denounced in 1957 as a rightist in Mao Zedong's Anti Rightist Campaign, and was sent to the Great Northern Wilderness in Heilongjiang to be reformed through labour. Xin was pressured to divorce her husband, but refused. Citing a legendary love story from one of her operas, she said Wang Baochuan waited 18 years for Xue Pinggui, and I will wait 28 years for Wu Zuguang. As a result, she was herself labeled a rightist and went through struggle sessions. Wu returned to Beijing after three years of hard labour, but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced at the beginning of the period. She was severely beaten by a junior actor of the China Pingju Institute her left knee was broken and she never fully recovered from the injury. The couple's friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. After her beating Xin served seven years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke. Wu took care of her for the rest of her life. After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was politically rehabilitated in 1979, but was unable to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two million word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In April 1998, while visiting Changzhou, her husband's hometown, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. She was sent to Changzhou No. 1 People's Hospital, where she died after a week, on 12 April 1998. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang had three children. Their son, Wu Huan, is also a writer, painter, and calligrapher. After the deaths of Xin in 1998 and of Wu Zuguang in 2003, he organized the exhibition A Hundred Years of the Wu Family at the Poly Art Museum in Beijing. It was also shown in France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The Xin style of pingju pioneered by Xin Fengxia has become one of the most important styles of the opera. In 2014, the China Pingju Institute created a new opera entitled Xin Fengxia to commemorate her life, with focuses on her reformation of the opera, and the love story of Xin and Wu. It is written by Huang Weiruo , and directed by Guo Xiaonan .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin%20Fengxia
"The Xindi is the 53rd episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek Enterprise, the first episode of the third season. It first aired on September 10, 2003, on the UPN network in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and directed by Allan Kroeker. Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX 01. Beginning with this episode, season three of Enterprise features an ongoing storyline following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi at the end of season two. In this episode, the crew of the Enterprise attempt to track down the location of the Xindi homeworld from a lone Xindi working in a mining colony. After being tricked by the mining foreman, Captain Jonathan Archer Scott Bakula and Commander Charles Trip Tucker III Connor Trinneer escape with the alien, with assistance from Lieutenant Malcolm Reed Dominic Keating and the ship's new Military Assault Command Operations MACO team. The Xindi saw the first appearance of several new sets, as well as a new costume for Sub Commander T'Pol Jolene Blalock . The episode saw a large number of guest stars, including several who would recur several more times during the third season such as Major Hayes played by Steven Culp, Tucker Smallwood as the Xindi Primate Councilor and Randy Oglesby as Degra. The episode received ratings of 2.6 5 percent according to Nielsen Media Research, and was watched by 4.1 million viewers. The Xindi received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the increase of action promised for the season by this episode but criticised elements such as the writing and the MACOs. As Enterprise travels deeper into the Delphic Expanse, a secret council of aliens discuss what to do with the lone human spaceship. Meanwhile, Captain Jonathan Archer Scott Bakula directs Enterprise to a mining penal colony within the Expanse. He then strikes a deal with the mine's foreman Stephen McHattie in exchange for a half liter of liquid platinum, Archer and Commander Charles Trip Tucker III Connor Trinneer will be allowed to meet a Primate worker named Kessick Richard Lineback . Archer requests the coordinates of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, but he soon learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims to know how to escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly fall into the hands of the mine's security forces. Meanwhile, Sub Commander T'Pol Jolene Blalock persuades Lieutenant Malcolm Reed Dominic Keating to allow the newly assigned MACOs Military Assault Command Operations to attempt an extraction. Led by him, they perform remarkably well in combat, and manage to rescue Archer, Tucker, and Kessick. Enterprise then leaves orbit just as the warships arrive. Unfortunately, Kessick dies, but not before providing coordinates for the Xindi homeworld. When the ship reaches this position, there is nothing but a 120 year old field of space debris implying a destruction around the year 2033 . The episode followed up on the plot introduced in the final instalment of the second season in which a probe from an unknown alien race attacks Earth. A number of new sets and costumes were required, with preparations beginning for some departments up to three weeks before filming began. One change which was made was a new outfit for T'Pol, with costume tests taking place a week before filming began. The redesign was because of studio executives wanting the show to appeal more to the 1849 male demographic. The production team looked to the mid series boost that the introduction of Seven of Nine provided on Star Trek Voyager and sought for Enterprise to appeal to that demographic in the same manner. Kate O'Hara of New York Magazine later joked in reference to the change, Women of the future will certainly choose to wear tight, uncomfortable, skin tight catsuits The Xindi was seen as a new pilot by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said We were re establishing an Enterprise that was going to be a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms. They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a big episode as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days as opposed to the usual seven to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of season four. The Xindi featured several actors who would go on to recur in their roles throughout the third season of Enterprise. These included the MACO marines under the command of Major Hayes, played by Steven Culp. At the time of his appearance in The Xindi , he felt that he did not have any characterisation to work with. During the production of his second episode, The Shipment , Culp read an article in the Los Angeles Times about a troubled youth who joined the military and in serving in the Iraq War had found himself. After discussing it with the director, this became the basis for the character. Daniel Dae Kim made his first of three appearances in The Xindi as Corporal Chang he had previously appeared as Gotana Retz in the Voyager episode Blink of an Eye . Nathan Anderson had previously appeared as Namon in the Voyager episode Nemesis he made one further appearance as Sergeant Kemper in the following episode, Anomaly . Other actors appearing in The Xindi included the members of the Xindi council. As with Kim and Anderson, Tucker Smallwood had already appeared on Voyager. In his case, it was as Admiral Bullock in the episode In the Flesh . He appeared as his Xindi character nine times during the third season of Enterprise. Randy Oglesby, who played Degra, was another Voyager alumnus. He had appeared as Kir in the episode Counterpoint . Rick Worthy had appeared as several different characters in the Star Trek franchise, including an appearance in the 1998 film Star Trek Insurrection. As well as Kornan in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine episode Soldiers of the Empire , he too had appeared in Voyager, but in two roles first as the androids 3947 and 122 in Prototype and then as Noah Lessing in Equinox . In addition, making a return to the Star Trek franchise was Stephen McHattie, who had previously appeared as the Romulan senator Vreenak in the Deep Space Nine episode In the Pale Moonlight . The Xindi was first aired in the United States on UPN on September 10, 2003. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received a 2.6 5 percent share among adults. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was estimated that The Xindi was watched by 4.1 million viewers. The following episode, Anomaly , received the same rating but the viewer number increased by 200,000. Robert Bianco reviewed The Xindi for USA Today, giving it two out of four stars. He said that while the Xindi storyline does promise to provide more action and excitement , some of the alterations smack of desperation . He called T'Pol Seven of Vulcan , and said the main issue with the series was the subpar writing. In this episode, he felt that Tucker was written so poorly that Trineer seemed like he was overacting to compensate for it. A reviewer by the moniker KJB watched the episode for IGN, giving it one out of five stars. He said it was like watching a television episode made up of all the things from the 'Stuff We've Tried That Doesn't Work on Star Trek' list. Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as Starship Troopers clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as bad Farscape knock offs , and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone for the rest of the season. Michelle Erica Green said she was in a double mind about The Xindi in her review at TrekNation as there were both good and bad elements. She praised the action sequences, the make up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi races would be interesting. On the other hand, she thought that the MACO scenes were too dark and that the T'Pol nude scenes were unnecessary. The Xindi was adapted as a novel in conjunction with the preceding episode, The Expanse , by J.M. Dillard. Entitled The Expanse, the book was published by Pocket Books in trade paperback format in October 2003. The first home media release of The Xindi was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu ray release of Enterprise was released on January 7, 2014.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Xindi
"Nikephoros Xiphias Greek , fl. ca. 10001028 was a Byzantine military commander during the reign of Emperor Basil II. He played a distinguished role in the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria, and was instrumental in the decisive Byzantine victory at the Battle of Kleidion in 1014. In 1022 he led an unsuccessful rebellion against Basil II, and was disgraced, tonsured and exiled. He is last mentioned in 1028, when he was recalled from exile and retired to a monastery. Nikephoros Xiphias was born probably some time around or before 980, and was most likely the son of Alexios Xiphias, who served as the Catepan of Italy in 100608. Few members of the Xiphiai are otherwise known and the family's origin is unclear, but they most likely hailed from Asia Minor, like many other prestigious families of the military aristocracy of the period. Nikephoros appears for the first time in Emperor Basil II's Bulgarian wars, in 999 1000, 1000 1 or 1002, depending on the source. At the time he was a protospatharios, and along with the patrikios Theodorokanos, he commanded a campaign deep into Bulgarian lands. Setting out from Mosynopolis, the two generals crossed the Balkan Mountains and captured the old Bulgarian capitals of Pliska and Great Preslav, along with Little Preslav. They then plundered the Dobruja, left behind garrisons and returned to their base. It is unclear whether he was already the military governor strategos of Philippopolis at the time, or was appointed to it after the successful conclusion of the campaign, as John Skylitzes reports, when Theodorokanos, who is known to have previously held the post, retired due to his advanced age. Xiphias is next mentioned in the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, when Basil II was attempting to force the pass known as Kleidion or Kiava Longos, which the Bulgarians under their ruler Samuil had strongly fortified. Xiphias, still strategos of Philippopolis, suggested to the Emperor to bypass the Bulgarian positions and strike them from the rear. After Basil agreed, Xiphias led a picked infantry detachment over Mount Belasica, and on 29 July 1014, led his troops on a charge on the unsuspecting Bulgarians, who panicked and broke before the unexpected attack. For this feat, which resulted in one of the most decisive victories in the long Bulgarian war, he was rewarded with promotion to the rank of patrikios. In early 1015, Xiphias, along with Constantine Diogenes, subdued the region of Moglena, which had rebelled against imperial rule. Towards the end of the same year he campaigned from Mosynopolis to the region of Triaditza Sofia , razing its environs and capturing the fort of Boyana. Finally, in the last year of the Bulgarian war, in 1018, starting from Kastoria he subdued the remaining Bulgarian strongholds in the region of Servia. In 1021 22, however, Xiphias, now posted at Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II because he was not allowed to accompany the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had risen in revolt in the early years of Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and that one of them should take his place who it would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming to sow distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics. Brought to Constantinople, Xiphias was tonsured and banished to Antigone, one of the Princes Islands. Following his return to the capital after his Georgian expedition, Basil II had most of his co conspirators imprisoned and their estates confiscated. The patrikios Pherses the Iberian was executed, while two imperial chamberlains were also killed one by Basil's own hand, and the other, who had tried to poison the Emperor, was thrown to the beasts. According to the contemporary historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and weary, and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is known of him.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros%20Xiphias
"XO is a song by American singer Beyonce from her fifth and self titled studio album in 2013. Columbia Records released the song as the lead contemporary hit radio single from the album in the US and Italy on December 16, 2013. Ryan Tedder co wrote and co produced XO with Terius The Dream Nash and Beyonce, with additional production handled by Chauncey Hit Boy Hollis and HazeBanga Music. A pure midtempo power pop and R B love song with electronic influences, XO is complete with electronic musical instrumentation, synthesizers and drums. Musically, it was compared to Beyonce's own song Halo and was noted for having several music hooks including its call and response chorus. The usage of an audio sample from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster at the beginning of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew, NASA, and some media. Beyonce released a statement saying that the song was intended to help people who have lost loved people in their lives and that the sample was included as a tribute to the Challenger crew. XO managed to appear on many music charts across Europe and Oceania and it peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the song directed by Terry Richardson was filmed in Coney Island in late August 2013. It was made available on iTunes with the release of the album on December 13, 2013 and was released online three days later. Beyonce performed the song during the last stops of the North American leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in December 2013 and later during the tour's second European leg in early 2014. To further promote XO , she performed it at the 2014 BRIT Awards and later at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Haim and John Mayer covered the song in 2014, with the latter releasing it as a single. XO was written by Beyonce, Terius The Dream Nash and Ryan Tedder while the production was helmed by the aforementioned group as well as Chauncey Hit Boy Hollis and HazeBanga. Ramon Rivas engineered the song, with assistance from Justin Hergett. Beyonce's vocals were recorded by Stuart White and Bart Schoudel while all instrumentation and programming was carried out by Tedder. The song was finally mixed by Andrew Scheps. XO was recorded in four studios Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios, both in New York City, Trackdown Studios in Sydney and Tritonus Studios in Berlin. During an interview with Australian radio station Nova in November 2013, Tedder revealed that he had collaborated with Beyonce on a song for her then upcoming album along with The Dream, further saying, Personally the song we did I like more than 'Halo'. I think it's a bigger, better song . However, he acknowledged that he did not know when the singer planned to release new material for her fifth album. The previous month, it was reported by a source to the Daily News that Beyonce planned to release a new single and video on December 3, 2013. The publication further speculated that the single was expected to be the song whose music video was filmed in August of the same year XO . Later, when Beyonce was released, Billboard reported that Blow would be released as the contemporary hit radio single both in the US and worldwide, and Drunk in Love would be sent to urban radio in the US only XO was scheduled to be released as the second worldwide radio single in 2014. However, radio programmers reportedly pushed back against the release of Blow to mainstream stations, finding its lyrics to be very explicit for the format and proposing that XO be released in its place. The release of Blow was therefore scrapped and XO impacted contemporary hit radio in Italy and adult contemporary radio in the US on December 16, 2013. It was also sent to US mainstream, urban and rhythmic radio on December 17. XO is a midtempo pop, electropop and R B love power ballad that bears resemblance to Beyonce's own 2008 song Halo , which was also produced by Tedder. Influences of electronic rock and reggaeton genres were also found in the song. XO was composed using common time in the key of C major, with a tempo of 85 beats per minute. It carries a celebratory, bumping Caribbean groove and a marching drum beat with shuffling dancehall influences. The instrumentation includes jittery keyboards, synthesizers, percussion and electronic musical instruments. The song also consists of electronic flourishes and looped riff patterns brought about by an organ instrument. XO was also noted for being a departure from the minimalistic sexual nature of the album, due to its pure pop sound. Jordan Sargent of Complex magazine wrote that XO contains influences of Jamaican singer Tanya Stephens. Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound described the song as a blend of cinematic reach of modern Top 40 pop with the patience and melancholy of post 808s Heartbreaks hip hop. Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast compared the song's stadium sound to tracks by the band U2. Beyonce's vocals in the song span from the note of A3 to the note of C5. When asked about her raw vocals in the song previously unheard on her material and the song's less polished sound, Beyonce revealed that XO was recorded when she had a bad sinus infection. She further revealed it was recorded as a demo in several minutes. The original demo vocals were kept for a year without being rerecorded as the singer really loved the imperfections and wanted to focus on the album's music instead of the vocals. The lyrics of XO express a cheerful celebration of love and life as Beyonce attempts to create light from darkness . It has been described as a universal love song which talks about different types of relationships. The singer lays emphasis on the importance of living the present with a person's loved one as life is unpredictable. She further sings about the tragedy and magnificence that life can hold. Throughout the song, the singer adopts a hopeful attitude and seems to have gone in trance with love, a state which is further augmented by the fact that she employs a generally low register. Caitlin White from the website The 405 interpreted the song's lyrics in depth In the darkest night of hate and intolerance we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love... It is for love that transcends the romantic conception of man and woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the cosmos. It leaves room for failure but hopes for success. The opening lines of XO are echo laden and in contrast to other songs on Beyonce, the ballad contains several hooks. Beyonce starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her. Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response Beyonce is backed by a sing along crowd as she sings about how her darkest nights are enlightened by the lover's face In the darkest night hour I search through the crowd Your face is all that I see I give you everything . The chorus ends with the singer adding, Baby love me, lights out , with a croak in her voice. The song begins with a six second long sample of former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt, recorded moments after Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986 Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction. These were the last words spoken before the disintegrating vehicle fell into the sea. The use of the sample has been criticized in the media, including Hardeep Phull of the New York Post, who described its presence in the song as tasteless . Former NASA astronauts and families were also dismayed and labeled the use of the sample as insensitive . Keith Cowing of NASA Watch suggested that the use of the clip ranged from negligence to repugnance. On December 30, 2013, NASA criticized the use of the sample, stating The Challenger accident is an important part of our history a tragic reminder that space exploration is risky and should never be trivialized. NASA works every day to honor the legacy of our fallen astronauts as we carry out our mission to reach for new heights and explore the universe. Earlier on the same date, Beyonce had issued a statement to ABC News in response to the families, explaining why she and her co songwriters decided to include the audio sample in XO My heart goes out to the families of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten. Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine defended Beyonce's choice to use the sample, and criticized the media reports for their dismissive interpretation of the song's vague lyrics as being about a girl in a relationship . According to Wickman, the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them, because you never know when that could be this is shown in the hook lines, Baby kiss me Before they turn the lights out You better kiss me Before our time has run out. A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a trivialization , instead describing it as a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment . Wickman concluded, If there's anything anyone should know by now about Beyonce Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self presentation that isn't carefully chosen. Caitlin White from the website The 405 noted that there was a reason for the song being couched in warnings of malfunction and tragedy elaborating, As far controversy, denying Beyonce the ability to embrace the intertextuality of incorporating a historical recording like the Challenger explosion is an attempt to relegate her art to a lower form of political discourse, one that's not 'worthy' of interacting with an event of cultural significance like this. But this is not just a 'pop album,' it's a woman holding forth on the role of women in our society, how they should approach the nuances of their life and most importantly, how they can choose to value relationships... That isn't just the work of a diva, that is the work of a political figure. Mike Wass of the website Idolator described it as a radio ready anthem... is impossible to beat . Vanity Fair writer Michelle Collins described it as the most upbeat and catchiest song of the lot on the album. Ryan Dennehy from the website AbsolutePunk opined that XO was a guaranteed, triumphant hit. Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described XO as magical further calling it the most radio friendly song on the entire album with its traditional pop structure. Peter Tabakis from the website Pretty Much Amazing listed the magnificent power ballad as one of the potential chart toppers of the album. Michael Cragg of The Guardian called the track a joyous, echo laden heart burst, and an immediate choice for a single. Stereogum's Tom Breihan found an immediately apparent hit ... the incandescent 'XO' . Rob Harvilla from Spin found monster single potential in XO . Marc Hogan of the same publication described the song as a potential radio hit that looms largest from the album. He further went on to praise its grandly swaying hook that makes the one from Jessie Ware's 'Wildest Moments' sound understated . Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media praised the song's big, boundary obliterating pop appeal and hailed it as a future blockbuster and hit. She went on to praise the singer's vocal performance in the song concluding all of the flawlessness here is brilliantly undercut by that gravelly croak . The song's pop and sing along sound and production received praise by critics. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the song's production as predictable and opined that the audience sing along chorus sounded like it was created specifically for being performed during an arena encore. Similarly, Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for ecstatic fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert This is the kind of chorus that's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come, and while XO may be relatively more subdued, that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed live, right down to the way her voice shows a little wear, just like it would at the end of a show. Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a cavernous widescreen anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a stadium filling one and classified it as one of Beyonce's decorous moments . Joe Lynch from Fuse described XO as the most uplifting pop song since Florence and the Machine's Shake It Out 2011 . He praised the electronic flourishes, saying that they managed to keep the music from veering into banal territory and concluded that the song has a quirky sound previously unheard on other material by Beyonce. Philip Sherburne of Spin found zero G bounce... which, purely in terms of sonics, makes the most compelling argument for space tourism I have yet to come across . Many critics considered XO to be a highlight on the album. Drowned in Sound's Robert Leedham opined in his review of the album, Most glorious of all is 'XO', a supermassive, dumbstruck ode to being in love and caring about fuck all else. It's the one album track that's linear enough to withstand a drunken singalong. Lavanya Ramanthatan of The Washington Post described the song as a swelling anthem and one of the highlights of Beyonce. Caitlin White from the website The 405, hailed XO as the album's crowning track... feels like even more of a triumph . Philip Cosores from Paste magazine noted that the song, along with several others in the closing portion of the album, was probably the best of her career . Jordan Sargent from Complex magazine described XO as the purest love song on Beyonce. However, a more mixed review came from Claire Lobenfeld of the same publication who felt that it was the only skippable track of the album due to its mawkish feel. Similarly, Chris Kelly of Fact magazine wrote that the song reeks of Ryan Tedder's paint by number hitmaking . Under the Radar's Ryan E.C. Hamm argued that XO made a strong case for being included as song of the year on several year end lists however he noted that this was not possible as the lists had already been compiled and published when the song was released. However, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone placed XO at number 8 in his year end list of the 25 best songs of 2013. The song was further ranked at number 72 in the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music. In 2014, Vulture's writer Jody Rosen listed the song at number 52 on his list of The 150 Greatest Schlock Songs Ever calling it an instant classic The grand, sparkly production screams 2013 the theme how love bears out to the edge of doom and all that is timeless. The same year, he further included the song in his list of the best songs by Beyonce published in The New York Times. In 2019, Pitchfork listed XO at number 182 on their greatest songs of the decade 2010s list. XO is nominated in the category for Best Song at the 2014 World Music Awards. Toyota featured the song, along with Beyonce, in their 2014 commercial as part of the Get Going campaign.

During a behind the scenes video, Richardson described the process for the filming of the clip for XO , You know, it's amazing cause in one point we were like in the arcade and I said to Beyonce let's just do this. You wanna open the door and you're gonna perform and we're just gonna walk out and see what happens and she was like 'Yeah, let's go for it'. And literally we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name. It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy. Beyonce further described the filming of the video as insanely chaotic before adding that it captured raw, fun and being in the moment . In order to prevent snippets of the song being leaked online, the singer wore earbuds during the filming of the video instead of playing the music loud and lip synced the lyrics.

A writer of Rap Up magazine wrote Beyonce was spread the love with the feel good clip . Idolator's Mike Wass said Happily is as gorgeous as the song with Terry Richardson simply filming Bey living it up at Coney Island. It's almost too perfect. In another review, he also hailed it as carefree, neon drenched and one of the best clips on the whole album adding that it looked more like a home movie than a music video which was part of its immense appeal . Rob Harvilla from Spin magazine described it as the sweetest video on the album. Chris Martins from the same publication wrote that the video is all pretty huge and heartwarming . Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph found happy innocence in the clip. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone noted that the clip was a fun video for a likewise song further saying that the hand choreography was Beyonce's version of a similar dance from the song Y.M.C.A. 1978 by Village People.

Melinda Newman from the website HitFix described Beyonce's look in the video as sultry, slightly euphoric and noted its main theme being about comparing love to a carnival. She concluded that the video for XO is interesting... almost as if we're seeing her in some state of heightened reality enhanced by some mood altering substance or maybe that's just what love does to Beyonce. Joe Lynch from Fuse commented that the shots of Beyonce's smiles, children dancing and roller coaster throughout the video made it the most joyous music video of 2013 . The same writer in another review said that the video shows Beyonce at her most flippant, casual best . Michelle Collins from the Vanity Fair described the singer's look as young, carefree further describing the video as FOMO to the max .

Mark Savage of BBC News opined, unbilled, stripped back performance of XO was undoubtedly the night's most flawless vocal . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described her as clearly the star of the show . However, Mark Sutherland of the Rolling Stone gave a mixed review about the performance saying it was a bit... dull . At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, Beyonce performed XO live during a medley consisting of songs from her self titled album.

"XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge guitars, vocals and Colin Moulding bass, vocals , the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on Britpop and later power pop acts. Partridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band's name and line up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that they were known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and, for the next five years, were noted for their energetic live performances. They aspired to be completely original and refused to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and the avant garde. The single Making Plans for Nigel 1979 marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music. After 1982's English Settlement, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio based project centred on Partridge, Moulding, and guitarist Dave Gregory. They continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums Skylarking produced by Todd Rundgren, 1986 , Oranges Lemons 1989 , Nonsuch 1992 and Apple Venus Volume 1 1999 . A spin off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one off excursion into 1960s style psychedelia, but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. Due to poor management, they never received a share of profits from record sales, of which there were millions, nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Between 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including Sgt. Rock Is Going to Help Me 1980 and Senses Working Overtime 1982 . In the US, Mayor of Simpleton 1989 was their highest charting single, while Dear God 1986 was controversial for its anti religious message. The group also inspired tribute bands, tribute albums, fan conventions, and fanzines across the UK, US and Japan. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC in the past tense . Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC I in the late 2010s.

Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects. In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular. he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix style songs at churches and youth clubs Sort of acid skiffle. I thought, 'Ah, one day I'll play guitar ' But I didn't think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage. Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled Please Help Me , and attracted the nickname Rocky for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles' Rocky Raccoon 1968 . By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro avant garde stuff. I got really in deep. One of his first bands was called Stiff Beach , formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge's constantly evolving group settled into Star Park , a four piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed Nervous Steve . In 1972, Partridge became closer acquainted with Gregory, a diabetic then suffering from a bout of depression, while working as an assistant at the Bon Marche record shop in Swindon. Gregory was played the Mahavishnu Orchestra's album The Inner Mounting Flame 1971 , which he later called one of the watershed moments in my musical education. Partridge met Colin Moulding at the Stage Bar on Swindon's Old Town's Union Row, later known as Long's. Moulding had been playing bass since 1970 because I liked music I thought that playing a bass, with four strings, would be infinitely easier than playing a guitar, with six strings. That was a horrible misconception . At the end of 1972, Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers joined Partridge's band, replacing Nervous Steve and Paul Wilson, and the group was renamed Star Park Mark II . Other members would frequently join and leave the group. After Star Park opened for Thin Lizzy in May 1973, the band renamed themselves the Helium Kidz. Partridge's musical conceptions were blown away upon hearing the New York Dolls I suddenly just wanted to play three chords again and get out my mom's makeup and stuff. He subsequently wrote hundreds of songs for the Helium Kidz, and some demo tapes were sent to Decca Records. NME ran a small profile on the up and coming band, which consisted of Partridge, Moulding, Chambers and guitarist Dave Cartner They aspire to attain the impossible dream of being able to throw a TV or two out of the window of an American hotel and have no one complain. This version of the group lasted until 1975, when the Helium Kidz decided to rebrand themselves and change their music to three minute pop songs that were fast and inventive. Gregory auditioned for the band at this juncture, but did not end up joining. His musicianship was determined to be too good . It was decided that the band have another name change. The Dukes of Stratosphear was considered, but Partridge thought it was too flowery and psychedelic . He derived XTC from Jimmy Durante's exclamation upon discovering the lost chord That's it I'm in ecstasy . The name was chosen mainly for its emphatic appearance in print. Meanwhile, owing to creative differences with Partridge, synthesizer player Jonathan Perkins quit the band. In search of his replacement, Partridge found Barry Andrews through a keyboard player seeks band advertisement. Instead of a formal audition, the two went out drinking together. Andrews was immediately hired. During the first band rehearsal, Partridge recalled, He sounded like Jon Lord from Deep Purple fuzz box, wah wah pedal, bluesy runs. I said, You don't have to play like that, you can play like us if you want. The next rehearsal, he was like a maniac, like if Miro had played electric organ. Fantastic. December 1976 officially marked the beginning of the PartridgeMouldingChambersAndrews line up. The members cut their long hair and, for a time, wore kung fu mechanic outfits on stage. Andy Partridge elaborating on XTC's song This Is Pop , 2007 Ian Reid, owner of a Swindon club named The Affair, was their third manager and brokered deals for the group to perform at more popular venues such as the Red Cow in Hammersmith, The Nashville Rooms and Islington's Hope and Anchor. By this time, the punk rock movement had emerged, which opened an avenue for the group in terms of record label appeal, even though the band did not necessarily fit in the punk dogma. Partridge remembered hearing the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the U.K. 1976 and feeling underwhelmed by its similarity to the Monkees or the Ramones That sort of spurred me on watching this stuff that I thought was rather average. Soon, John Peel saw the band perform at Upstairs at Ronnie Scott's and asked them to appear on his BBC Radio 1 block. Partridge credited him as responsible for us getting a recording contract. ... As soon as we recorded that session for the BBC, suddenly three or four record labels wanted to sign us up. After declining CBS, Harvest and Island, they signed with Virgin Records. In August 1977, XTC made their first commercially released studio recordings with producer John Leckie at Abbey Road, which appeared on their debut album 3D EP in October. Their first full length record, White Music, was then recorded in less than two weeks, and released for January 1978. Partridge characterized the album as Captain Beefheart meets the Archies shrouded in 1950s style retrofuturism. He reflected that the album was the sum of everything the band enjoyed, including the Beatles, Sun Ra, and Atomic Rooster, but dismissed the contents as premature songs built around this electric wordplay stuff . White Music reached number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. Although the album was well received by the press Melody Maker, NME, Sounds, and Record Mirror all gave positive reviews , none of its singles managed to chart. They rerecorded This Is Pop as a lead single. Its follow up, Statue of Liberty , was banned on BBC Radio due to the lyric I sail beneath her skirt . With each member placed on a 25 weekly salary, the band toured perpetually for the next five years. The group also made appearances on the children's television shows Tiswas and Magpie, which meant they would occasionally play for under 16 crowds on these early tours. Partridge enjoyed these early shows, but would later resent touring as the band's audience numbers grew and the performing experience became more impersonal. By August 1978, XTC were prepared to record their next album. The band had contacted Brian Eno to produce after they learned that he was a fan, but he declined, telling them that they were good enough to produce themselves. Virgin rejected Eno's advice, and the group instead returned to Abbey Road with Leckie. Andrews appeared at the sessions with several original songs, but Partridge did not feel they were right for the band. He began taking Moulding and Chambers out for drinks without inviting Partridge, allegedly in an attempt to take over the group. After most of Andrews' songs were dropped from the final track list, the keyboardist told journalists that he foresaw the band explod pretty soon . Go 2, a more experimental venture, was released in October to positive reviews and a number 21 chart peak. Like White Music, it was given praise in Sounds, Melody Maker, and the NME. One of the tracks, Battery Brides Andy Paints Brian , was written in tribute to Eno. The album also included a bonus EP, Go , which consisted of five dub remixes of XTC songs. Andrews left the band in December 1978, while they were on their first American tour, and went on to form the League of Gentlemen with Robert Fripp of King Crimson. Partridge said He enjoyed undermining what little authority I had in the band. We were bickering quite a lot. But when he left I thought, Oh shit, that's the sound of the band gone, this space cream over everything. And I did enjoy his brain power, the verbal and mental fencing. XTC went through a silly half hearted process of auditioning another keyboardist. Although Thomas Dolby was rumoured as a replacement, Partridge said that Dolby was never actually considered. Rather than hiring a replacement keyboardist, Dave Gregory of the covers band Dean Gabber and His Gaberdines was invited to join as a second guitarist. Partridge remembered holding a pretend audition where Gregory was asked to play This Is Pop , only for Gregory to inquire whether they wanted the album version or the single version We thought, 'Bloody oh, a real musician.' But he was in the band before he even knew. Gregory was anxious of whether the fans would accept him as a member, characterizing himself as the archetypal pub rocker in jeans and long hair. But the fans weren't bothered. Nobody was fashionable in XTC, ever. He grew more comfortable with the group after playing a few shows, he said, and things got better and better . XTC were impressed by Steve Lillywhite's work on Ultravox's 1977 debut, and Siouxsie and the Banshees The Scream, and he was contacted to produce their third album with a drum sound that would knock your head off . With engineer Hugh Padgham, the band embarked to the newly built Townhouse Studios, with its now world famous stone room Gregory later recalled that Padgham had yet to develop his trade mark 'gated ambience' sound . Coinciding with Gregory's arrival, the band recorded Life Begins at the Hop 1979 , a Moulding composition. By this time, Moulding wanted to ditch quirky nonsense and do more straight ahead pop. He was surprised to learn that the label chose his song as a single over Partridge's. Upon release, it was the first charting single for the band, rising to number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. For a period, most of the group's singles were not placed on their albums. Moulding explained that this was because of an industry convention in the 1960s and the 1970s, and that when we wanted to shift albums later on, that approach got blown out of the water. Drums and Wires, released in August 1979, was named for its emphasis on guitars and expansive drums. AllMusic reviewer Chris Woodstra wrote that it signalled a turning point ... with a more subdued set of songs that reflect an increasing songwriting proficiency. The aimless energy of the first two albums is focused into a cohesive statement with a distinctive voice that retains their clever humor, quirky wordplay, and decidedly British flavor. ... driven by the powerful rhythms and angular, mainly minimalistic arrangements. The distinctive drum pattern of its lead single, Moulding's Making Plans for Nigel , was an attempt to invert drum tones and accents in the style of Devo's cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction . The song became a number 17 hit and helped propel the album to number 37 in the UK. Before Nigel , XTC had struggled to fill more than half the seats of the small club circuits they played. Afterward, the single was playlisted at the BBC, which helped the band secure two appearances on Top of the Pops. When touring resumed in November, every date was sold out. In later years, the album became the best known of XTC's discography and Moulding and Partridge would look back on this point as the symbolic start of the band's career. To follow up Nigel , the band released Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down 1980 , a reggae influenced Partridge song with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame. It was their lowest selling single to date. Concurrently, Virgin issued Moulding's Ten Feet Tall as the band's first US single. According to Gregory, Colin began to fancy himself as the 'writer of the singles' . In response to the fuss made over Colin's songs , Partridge attempted to exert more authority in the group I thought I was a very benevolent dictator. Gregory disagreed, recalling that the band was pretty tired and that Partridge could be a little bit of a bully. Partridge at this point released a side project with Take Away The Lure of Salvage in early 1980 a one off record that appeared without much notice, except in Japan, where it was hailed as a work of electronic genius and outsold all other XTC albums. Black Sea, released in September 1980, reunited the group with Lillywhite and Padgham and was well received critically. Singles Generals and Majors , Towers of London and Sgt. Rock Is Going to Help Me returned them to the charts at numbers 32, 31 and 16, respectively. Sgt. Rock provoked feminist hate mail for the lyric keep her stood in line . Partridge regretted the song, calling it crass but not enjoyably crass . Respectable Street was banned from BBC radio due to its references to abortion and a Sony Entertainment Centre . Partridge believed Black Sea was the closest the group had come to representing their live sound in the studio. It remains XTC's second highest charting British album, placing at number 16, and the most successful album in the U.S. of their career, peaking at number 41 on the Billboard 200. That October, the documentary XTC at the Manor, which featured the band faking a studio session for Towers of London , was broadcast on BBC2. From 1980 to 1981, XTC toured Australia, New Zealand and the US in support of Black Sea as the opening act for the Police. At this point, they were playing in arena stadiums while Partridge's mental state was beginning to deteriorate, and he requested to cease touring, but was opposed by Virgin, his bandmates, and the band's management. He would occasionally experience moments of memory lapse to the extent that he would forget who he was. His then wife Marianne blamed his illness on his longtime dependency on Valium, which he had been prescribed since the age of 12. She threw away the tablets, and over the next year, he experienced intense withdrawal effects that he later described as brain melt . XTC became their own producers for their next album project. Until this point, Partridge had insisted that every part of the band's arrangements on record could be replicated live. He believed that if I wrote an album with a sound less geared towards touring then maybe there would be less pressure to tour. As such, the new music showcased more complex and intricate arrangements, song lengths were longer, and subject matter covered broader social issues. Much of the new material also featured acoustic instruments. Gregory bought a Rickenbacker 12 string and began contributing to the records as a keyboardist. In February 1982, English Settlement was released as the group's first double album. The hook of its lead single, Senses Working Overtime , was based on Manfred Mann's 5 4 3 2 1 1964 , Both the album and single became the highest charting records they would ever have in the UK, peaking at number five and number 10, respectively. In several territories outside the UK, the album was released as a single LP. The group scheduled television appearances and an international tour in support of English Settlement. During a live broadcast gig in Paris, Partridge ran off the stage, and afterward, took a flight back to Swindon for treatment, which amounted to hypnotherapy. He described feeling nausea and stomach pains while on stage My body and brain said, You're hating this experience I'm going to make it bad for you. When you go on stage I'm going to give you panic attacks and stomach cramps. You're not enjoying this and you haven't got the heart to tell anyone you can't carry on so I'm gonna mess you up. The band's remaining tour dates in England were cancelled. After recovering from the episode, Partridge rejoined the group for their first tour of the US as a headlining act. The band played the first date in San Diego. Gregory said that they were totally unrehearsed during the performance because we'd not played together for two weeks. ... It was obvious that he was ill, but exactly what it was, no one knew. On 4 April 1982, XTC were scheduled to play a sold out show at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Partridge woke up that morning, he said, and couldn't get off the bed. My legs wouldn't function. Walked to Ben Frank's coffee shop, where we'd all agreed to meet, in slow motion like I had both legs in plaster, trying not to throw up. I got in there, they knew what I was going to say. The tour ceased. He continued his hypnotherapy treatment, fearing that he was turning into the archetypal rock burn out such as Syd Barrett . It got to the point where if I touched the front door knob, I wanted to throw up. For a period afterward, it was rumoured among fans and industry insiders that the group stopped performing because Partridge had died, and some American bands put on XTC tribute shows in his remembrance. Andy Partridge, 2000 The cancelled American tour incurred XTC with a 20,000 debt, and since it left them unable to record new material, they decided to reexamine their financial affairs. Confused as to where their earnings had gone, the group requested that manager Ian Reid help pay for the debts, but he refused, saying that they had owed him money. They tried distancing themselves from Reid by renegotiating their contract with Virgin. Six more albums were promised to the label in exchange for covering their debts, as well as a guarantee that subsequent royalty and advancement cheques be redirected into the band's own deposit account. Royalty rates were still kept relatively low, as the group's A R man Paul Kinder explained, they had appalling management for a number of years. Usually if a manager has got any kind of business acumen he will renegotiate the contract to get a better royalty. A record company expects this, which is why they keep royalties low initially. It's just business really. Nobody addressed the contract for XTC. Reid remained XTC's manager until January 1983 according to the book Chalkhills and Children or a couple years afterward according to Partridge . He legally retained the title of XTC's manager until near the end of the decade. In April 1984, the group learned that he had incurred them an outstanding value added taxes bill and that he had significantly mishandled their revenue stream. A lawsuit was filed by the band, while he counter sued for unpaid commission on royalties . Virgin were then legally required to freeze royalty and advance payments and divert publishing income into a frozen deposit account. For the next decade, the entirety of the band's earnings would be invested in the continued litigation. The group supported themselves mostly through short term loans from Virgin and royalty payments derived from airplay. At one point, Moulding and Gregory were working at a car rental service for additional income. Partridge was eventually left with about 300 in the bank , he said, which is really heavy when you've got a family and everyone thinks you're 'Mr Rich and Famous'. A court enforced gag order restricts the band from speaking publicly on the alleged improprieties. According to Partridge, Reid was very naughty and left the band with roughly 300,000 in unpaid VAT. Music journalist Patrick Schabe elaborates ... what is known is that inked a deal with Virgin that wound up working out primarily for Reid, secondarily for Virgin, and not at all for XTC. Throughout their first five years of existence, XTC never saw a penny of profits from either album sales or touring revenue. Reid, on the other hand, took out large loans from Virgin, borrowing against XTC's royalties, to the tune of millions of pounds by some estimates. Even after the band settled out of court with Reid, because of the terms of the contract, Virgin was able to hold XTC liable for the sum. Because of XTC's failure to tour, the likelihood of ever repaying Virgin dwindled further and further away. Over the course of a 20 year contract with Virgin Records, and after achieving gold and platinum status in album sales on a number of discs, XTC never saw any publishing royalties. During the middle months of 1982, Partridge spent his time in convalescence and writing songs. He later surmised that relinquishing Valium inadvertently gave him a new sense of creative direction I was thinking clearer and wanted to know stuff. Life's big questions. In the interim, Chambers moved to Australia and started a family. Feeling dismayed by Partridge's decision not to tour, he had to be persuaded to return to Swindon for the next album's rehearsals in September. At one rehearsal, Partridge recalled asking Chambers for tiny, cyclical, nattering clay pots , which he replied sounded a bit fucking nancified . The newly wed Chambers soon left the band to be with his wife in Australia. Drummer Pete Phipps, formerly of the Glitter Band, was quickly hired as a temporary substitute. In the meantime, Virgin released a greatest hits compilation, Waxworks Some Singles 19771982, to underwhelming sales. The group's new material was rejected by Virgin executive Jeremy Lascelles, who suggested that they write something more commercial. Partridge remembered, He asked me to write something a bit more like The Police, with more international flavour, more basic appeal. Lascelles said that he had actually named Talking Heads, not the Police Andy likes to portray us as the strict, stern schoolmasters, but we never wanted him to compromise at anything we thought he was good at. Here were very talented songwriters surely, surely, surely they can come up with that elusive thing that is a hit single. That was our psyche. After some remixing and additional songs at Virgin's behest, Mummer, the first product of the studio bound XTC, appeared in August 1983. Virgin did little to promote the album and delayed its release by several months. At number 58, it was their lowest charting album to date. The one single that did chart, Love on a Farmboy's Wages , did find significant airplay on BBC Radio 1. It was the first of a handful of XTC songs written over the years that reflected their poor financial state. Virtually every contemporary review of Mummer accused the band of falling out of touch with the contemporary music climate. Journalist Serene Dominic retrospectively wrote that the album was seen as something of a disappointment at the time of release ... devoid of silly songs like 'Sgt. Rock' that had heretofore been the band's stock in trade and didn't rock out until the last song, 'Funk Pop a Roll.' ... Mummer signaled a strange rebirth for XTC. Moulding thought that when we came back from America after our aborted tour of 1982 ... people like Spandau Ballet had moved onto the scene new groups were coming up and there was no place for us. Mojo journalist Chris Ingham summed up the period In 18 months, XTC had gone from Top 10 hits and critical superlatives to being ignorable, arcane eccentrics. 'Your average English person probably thinks we split up in 1982,' suggests Partridge. He's probably right. XTC released the 1983 holiday single Thanks for Christmas under the pseudonym Three Wise Men. It was produced by David Lord, owner of Crescent Studios in Bath, and they subsequently negotiated a deal that allowed them to work as much as they wanted on their next album at his studio. Some of the album was recorded using a Linn LM 1 Drum Computer, and extensive time was spent on its programming. Partridge envisioned the work as industrial pop inspired by Swindon, a railway town . The end result, The Big Express, returned the group to a brighter and uptempo sound marked by studio experimentation and denser arrangements, setting a template that they would develop on subsequent albums. He jokingly referred to some parts of the album as the only time the group were befallen with stereotypical 1980s style production. It was released in October 1984, reaching a higher chart position than Mummer, but was virtually ignored by critics. Virgin invested 33,000 into the music video for All You Pretty Girls to little effect. The band were charged for the sum. When Gregory joined the band in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime enthusiasm for 1960s psychedelic music. An album of songs in that style was immediately put to consideration, but the group could not go through with it due to their commercial obligations to Virgin. In November 1984, one month after The Big Express's release, Partridge and John Leckie traveled to Monmouth to produce the album Miss America by singer songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara, who had recently signed with Virgin. Partridge and Leckie were dismissed due to conflicts related to their religious affiliations or lack thereof O'Hara was a devout Catholic . Partridge was feeling inspired by Nick Nicely's 1982 psychedelic single Hilly Fields 1892 , and devised a recording project to fill the newfound gap in his schedule. The rules were as follows songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia no more than two takes allowed use vintage equipment wherever possible. After receiving a 5,000 advance from a skeptical Virgin Records, the group devoted two weeks to the sessions. Calling themselves the Dukes of Stratosphear , the spin off group consisted of Partridge and Moulding with Dave and his drummer brother Ian. Each adopted a pseudonym Sir John Johns, The Red Curtain, Lord Cornelius Plum and E.I.E.I. Owen. At the sessions, the band dressed themselves in Paisley outfits and lit scented candles. With nothing to live up to as the Dukes, Partridge looked back on the project as the most fun we ever had in the studio ... We never knew if it would sell ... We could never subvert everybody's expectations with XTC, as there was too much money involved and we were expected to be mentally honest and 'real.' Too much financial pressure. Released on April Fools' Day 1985, the album was presented as a long lost collection of recordings by a late 1960s group. When asked about the album in interviews, XTC initially denied having any involvement. In England, the six track mini album sold twice as many copies as The Big Express, even before the Dukes' identity was made public. The album also achieved considerable sales in the US. During a routine meeting in early 1986, Virgin executives threatened to drop the band from the label if their next album failed to sell more than 70,000 units. One reason why the group was not selling enough records, Virgin reportedly concluded, was that they sounded too English . The label forced the group to work with one of their selected American producers. When shown a list of their names, they recognised none except for Todd Rundgren. Gregory was a fan of Rundgren's music, particularly since hearing the 1978 album Hermit of Mink Hollow. His bandmates were not as familiar with Rundgren, but Gregory urged the group to work with him I reminded Andy that Todd had produced one of his favourite New York Dolls records New York Dolls, 1973 . In the absence of any better alternatives, he agreed. Once contacted, Rundgren offered to handle the album's entire recording for a lump sum of 150,000, and the band agreed. In January 1986, Partridge and Moulding mailed Rundgren a collection of more than 20 demo tapes they had stockpiled in advance. Compared to previous XTC albums, much of the material contrasted significantly with its mellower feel, lush arrangements, and flowery aesthetic. Rundgren responded with the idea of a concept album to bridge Colin's 'pastoral' tunes and subject matter and Andy's 'pop anthems' and sly poetry. ... The album could be about a day, a year, or a lifetime. ... Using this framework, I came up with a sequence of songs and a justification for their placement and brought it to the band. After the group arrived at Utopia Sound recording studio in upstate New York, Rundgren played a large role in the album's sound design and drum programming, providing them with string and brass arrangements, as well as an assortment of gear. However, the sessions were fraught with tension, especially between him and Partridge, and disagreements arose over drum patterns, song selections, and other details. Partridge likened the power struggle to two Hitlers in the same bunker . He expressed resentment toward Rundgren's contributions when sessions concluded, but later softened his view and praised the end result. Rundgren said that in spite of all the difficulties, the album ultimately ... sounds like we were having a great time doing it. And at times we were having a good time. Writer Michael Azzerad, 1989 Skylarking spent one week on the UK album charts, reaching number 90 in November 1986, two weeks after its release. Moulding's Grass was chosen as lead single. It was issued exclusively in the UK with the B side Dear God , an outtake. Dear God became so popular with American college radio stations who imported the record that Geffen Records XTC's US distributor recalled and re pressed Skylarking with the track included. Controversy also broke out over the song's anti religious lyrics, which inspired some violent incidents. In Florida, a radio station received a bomb threat, and in New York, a student forced their school to play the song over its public address system by holding a faculty member at knife point. Nonetheless, the commercial success of Dear God propelled Skylarking to sell more than 250,000 units, and it raised the band's profile among American college youth. In the US, the album spent 29 weeks on the Billboard 200 and reached its peak position of number 70 in June 1987. The music video for Dear God received the 1987 Billboard Best Video award and was also nominated for three categories at the MTV Video Music Awards. Skylarking ultimately became XTC's best known album and is generally regarded as their finest work. Partridge was reluctant to make another Dukes album, but to appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, Psonic Psunspot 1987 was recorded. This time, 10 songs and a 10,000 budget was supplied, while John Leckie returned as producer. Once again, the Dukes' record outsold XTC's previous album in the UK Skylarking in this case . Partridge felt it was a bit upsetting to think that people preferred these pretend personalities to our own personalities ... But I don't mind because we have turned into the Dukes slowly over the years. Likewise, Moulding felt that the psychedelic element was being more ingratiated into the pie since 25 O'Clock. When issued on CD, Psonic Psunspot was combined with 25 O'Clock and given the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball 1987 . For their next album Oranges Lemons, XTC traveled to Los Angeles to make use of a cheap studio rate arranged by Paul Fox, who was recruited by the band for his first production gig. Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, said Gregory, was that America was our biggest market . The album was released in February 1989 with music that was in a similar psychedelic vein as the Dukes. In a retrospective review, The Quietus' Nick Reed notes Nearly every instrument is mixed to the forefront it's too well arranged to be cacophonous, but there's a degree of sensory overload, especially given the band's newfound tendency to blast synthesizers in our faces. ... whether or not this album holds up for you depends on how much you like the band's boisterous side. It became the highest album they had in the charts since 1982's English Settlement, rising to number 28 in the UK and number 44 in the US. Additionally, it combined with Skylarking for the group's best selling albums to date. Mayor of Simpleton reached number 46 in the UK and number 72 in the US, making it their only American single to chart. To support the album, XTC embarked on an acoustic guitar American radio tour that lasted for two weeks in May. The shows were carried out without financial compensation for the band. Gregory commented that it was an interesting style of promotion, but incredibly hard work , as the band performed at about four radio stations a day for three weeks We also did a live acoustic set for MTV in front of an audience which worried Andy a bit but he got through it. This inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped down sets, calling the series unplugged . XTC's performance of King for a Day on Late Night with David Letterman marked the first time the group played in front of a live audience in seven years. A similar acoustic tour was planned for Europe, but cancelled when Partridge discovered that the Paris date would be broadcast from a sold out 5,000 seater venue. After an unsuccessful attempt was made to coax Partridge back into regular touring, they took a short break. Partridge produced And Love for All 1990 , the third album by the Lilac Time, and compered for an unbroadcast children's game show named Matchmakers. Gregory played for Johnny Hates Jazz, Marc Almond and Francesco Messina whilst producing for Cud. Moulding performed a special event concert with David Marx and the Refugees, a Swindon based band that reunited him with Barry Andrews. Tarquin Gotch, who served as XTC's manager for a short time, helped the band reach a legal settlement with Ian Reid in 1989. However, they were again left with a six figure debt. Virgin Records advanced the group enough money to cover their debt in exchange for the promise of four additional albums. Having written more than two dozen songs by 1991, some difficulties prolonged the start of recording sessions for the next album. Initially, the band had issue with the musical director of Virgin, who, after seeing the songs, was convinced the band could do better and asked them to write more material. With the band sitting on the material, the director left the label a year later, and his replacement liked the band's content, hurrying them to record the album. Gus Dudgeon produced, even though Partridge felt he was the wrong choice, and Fairport Convention's Dave Mattacks was brought in as drummer. Nonsuch was received with critical acclaim when released in April 1992, and like Oranges Lemons, peaked at number 28 in the UK, becoming their second consecutive and final Top 40 album. Rolling Stone's Michael Azerrad reviewed Emphasizing wonder and wit in opposition to the rage of most college rock, XTC makes alternative music for people who don't like 'alternative music.' Lead single The Disappointed reached number 33 in the UK and was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award. Its follow up The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead reached number 71. Wrapped in Grey was intended as the third single, and about 5,000 copies were pressed before being withdrawn from sale. Partridge remembered thinking, that's it, they've suffocated one of our kids in the cot, they've murdered the album, basically through ignorance. In 1993, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, but lost to Tom Waits' Bone Machine. In 1993, Partridge conceived XTC's next project to be an album of bubblegum pop songs disguising itself as a retrospective compilation featuring 12 different groups from the early 1970s. The lyrics were also heavily sexual, with song titles such as Lolly Suck It and See and Visit to the Doctor . Partridge recalled playing some demos for Virgin agents, and compared their reaction to the Springtime for Hitler scene from the 1967 film The Producers. The label rejected his idea. Virgin denied Partridge's requests to renegotiate or revoke XTC's contract. Paul Kinder believed that the label and the group were poles apart and that the contract was so old it got to the point where Andy wanted the moon and Virgin weren't prepared to give it him. Whatever new music the band recorded would have been automatically owned by Virgin, and so the band enacted strike action against the label. Prince and George Michael also went on a strike against their respective labels that was heavily publicized at about the same time. XTC's strike, however, received little press. In the meantime, Partridge produced Martin Newell's 1993 album The Greatest Living Englishman and early sessions for Blur's second album. I thought I did sterling work. ... Next day, , 'Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.' Other complications arose he developed some health issues while his wife divorced him. In 1997 also reported as in late 1994 , XTC found themselves freed from financial debt and from Virgin after making some heavy concessions . Partridge fantasied that people from the label met in the dark and thought, 'These blokes are not making a living. We've had 'em all these years and we've got their catalogue and the copyright to their songs for evermore and we've stitched 'em up real good with a rotten deal so, erm, maybe we should let them go.' I like to think that it was a guilt thing. One of the group's first new recordings since the strike was released for the tribute album A Testimonial Dinner The Songs of XTC 1995 . The Good Things , a Moulding song originally demoed for Oranges Lemons, was credited under the pseudonym Terry and the Lovemen. In 1998, Song Stories, an authorized overview of the band's catalog by journalist and longtime friend Neville Farmer was published. Partridge said the book was badly edited and used the crappiest quotes . Paul Morrish of The Independent, 1999 By late 1997, Partridge and Moulding had amassed a large stockpile of material. The former's songs were an elaboration on the more orchestral style he developed with Nonsuch tracks Omnibus , Wrapped in Grey , and Rook . Moulding felt that something a bit different was appropriate for the band at this juncture, and shared Partridge's desire for a cohesive LP similar to soundtracks such as My Fair Lady and stuff that Burt Bacharach wrote for various . Partridge thought the new songs were some of the best stuff, if not the best stuff, ever. It's even more intensely passionate than before. The group elected to divide the album into two parts one of rock songs, and the other of orchestral acoustic songs augmented by a 40 piece symphony. They found a label, Cooking Vinyl, and a producer, Haydn Bendall, who had engineered XTC's debut EP back in 1977 and had significant experience in recording orchestras. Prairie Prince, who drummed on Skylarking, returned for the sessions. It soon became apparent that the band did not have the funds to record all the material they had. Gregory, Moulding, and Bendall wanted to reduce the project to one disc, but Partridge insisted on spreading it over two LPs. It was decided that they release one album with the orchestral portions volume 1 and leave the rock songs for its follow up volume 2 . A session was booked at Abbey Road, but the recording was rushed, lasting one day, and had to be edited over a three month period. Gregory quit the band whilst in the middle of sessions due to personal issues and discord with his bandmates. Partridge told journalists that Gregory left because he grew impatient with the recording of the orchestral material and wanted to quickly move on to second project, which would have consisted of rock songs. He attributed Gregory's frustration to diabetic mood swings, as did Moulding. Gregory denied that his leaving pertained to musical differences , and that it was moreso personal problems related to Partridge. Released in February 1999, Apple Venus Volume 1 was met with critical acclaim and moderate sales. It had minimal promotion. Comparing the album to the group's earlier work, Pitchfork reviewer Zach Hooker wrote Apple Venus finds them picking up pretty much where they left off. Or maybe even a little bit before they left off this record bridges the gap between the ambitiously poppy Oranges and Lemons and the pastoral Skylarking. ... The music is built on simple phrases, but the relationships between those phrases becomes tremendously complex. In contrast, the companion album Wasp Star Apple Venus Volume 2 2000 , consisting of more guitar based material, was assumed as one of the band's weakest albums. Upon release, its British chart peak was higher than Volume 1, at number 40 in the UK, while in the US it was lower, at number 108. Partridge believed that some parts of the album was when the slope started to go down . After Wasp Star, newly recorded XTC material was released sporadically. The four disc hits and rarities boxed set Coat of Many Cupboards 2002 included Didn't Hurt a Bit , a rerecording of a Nonsuch outtake. The Dukes of Stratosphear with Dave and Ian Gregory were reunited for the charity single Open a Can of Human Beans 2003 . Another set, Apple Box 2005 , included two new tracks Spiral , written by Partridge and Say It , by Moulding. These songs were available to purchasers of the box set in digital format only, with the use of a special download code. This followed with a digital exclusive track, Moulding's Where Did the Ordinary People Go , released in December 2005. From 2002 to 2006, Partridge simultaneously released volumes in the multi album Fuzzy Warbles series, a set dedicated to unreleased solo demos and other material. Moulding was initially attached to the project, but opted out because I just wouldn't have found it very inspiring. Maybe a couple of volumes would've been okay, or just one. But he wanted to do twelve, which kind of put the wind up me a little bit. We had a bit of an argument about it. Partridge said that the impetus for the project was the proliferation of bootleggers who were selling low quality copies of the material and that the Fuzzy Warbles set earned him more money than XTC's back catalog on Virgin. He also did not feel that XTC were a band anymore It's more of a brand. It's more HP Sauce than ever. two selfish middle aged gits who make the music we make. In 2006, Partridge recorded an album, Monstrance, with Barry Andrews and drummer Martyn Barker. During one of the sessions, some of his hearing was destroyed following a studio mishap, which caused him to develop severe and permanent tinnitus. Near the end of the year, he told an interviewer that Moulding recently a couple of months back lost interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. He remained hopeful that the situation was temporary and assured that they had not killed off the XTC head. I mean, we still have the head cryogenically frozen. ... It's no good making a record and calling it XTC, certainly, if Colin isn't involved. In November, he stated that he had been forced to regard the group in the past tense, with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. Months later, Partridge intimated that Moulding had moved and changed his phone number, effectively ending all contact between the two and reducing their correspondence to emails exchanged via their manager to discuss the division of the band's assets. Partridge also said he and Gregory their differences now resolved had considered working together again. Colin Moulding, 2018 In July 2008, Partridge wrote in the Swindon Advertiser that he believed his musical partnership with Colin Moulding has come to an end. For reasons too personal and varied to go into here, but we had a good run as they say and produced some real good work. No, I won't be working with him in the future. In December, Moulding resurfaced for a live radio interview where he confirmed his recent disillusionment with music, but revealed that he was thinking of working on solo material. His given reasons for the break up were financial discord, disagreement over the extent of the Fuzzy Warbles project, and a change in mindset between him and Partridge. He also stated that he and Partridge were once again communicating directly by email. XTC did not technically break up in a legal sense. As of 2014, the group still existed as a trademark controlled by Partridge and Moulding. Throughout the 2010s, selected albums from the band's catalog were reissued as deluxe packages centred on new stereo and surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson. Partridge said that he did not insist on any mastering or messing with XTC 5.1 and that his involvement with Wilson's mixes goes only as far as authorizing them. The official XTC Twitter account xtcfans was originally managed by writer Todd Bernhardt. According to Partridge, after some time, I sort of took it over, because I thought it was weird that there was another person in the way. In 2016, Partridge and Bernhardt released a book, Complicated Game Inside the Songs of XTC, that contains discussions between the two about 29 XTC songs, one Partridge solo track, and an overview of his approach to songwriting. It was published by Jawbone Press. Until 2016, Moulding remained largely inactive as a musician. In October 2017, he and Terry Chambers issued a four song EP, Great Aspirations credited to TC I . Its release coincided with a televised documentary film of the band's career, XTC This Is Pop, which premiered on Sky Arts on 7 October. The documentary featured new interviews with Partridge, Gregory, Moulding and Chambers. Moulding praised the film and commented on the possibility of a full fledged XTC reunion They say never say never, don't they It would seem unlikely, put it that way. As of January 2018, Partridge maintained that the group would not be recording together again. From 29 October to 1 November, TC I performed four sold out shows at Swindon's Art's Centre, in Old Town. It was the first time Moulding and Chambers had played a live gig in decades. In January 2019, a statement released through social media announced that TC I had disbanded, and that Moulding has once again put his music career on hold in order to spend more time with his family. Dave Gregory, 2007 XTC's principal songwriters were guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding. Partridge, who wrote the majority of XTC's songs, was the group's frontman and de facto leader. He drove the band's image, designed many of their record sleeves, and handled most of their interviews. His involvement with XTC's record sleeves stemmed from his disappointment with the sleeve for the Statue of Liberty single, which depicted a poorly cropped photo of the statue and the XTC logo in red. He was less successful in his attempts to involve himself in the band's music videos, as he said, the woman in charge of Virgin's video department rebuked all his ideas, some of which other groups later adopted in award winning videos. Partridge and Moulding did not write together. Of their partnership, Moulding stated in 1992 There's a lot of freedom to do what each of us likes with the other's songs, however. ... Each person puts his little prints on them. They did collaborate on arrangements, with horn lines and harmonies, that sort of thing. He also lent praise to Partridge as a real ideas man, and I love good ideas. It's not hard contributing bass parts when you have such good songs to contribute to. Discussing Moulding's songs, Partridge said that few were included on XTC albums because Moulding was not a prolific writer. Gregory said that all of Moulding's proposed songs would be recorded to preserve democracy in the band, and occasionally at the expense of some of Andy's often superior offerings. This didn't always go down well, either with Andy or the band, but Colin did have some killer melodies and a sweeter sound to his voice that made a welcome diversion when listening to an album as a whole. Partridge opined that Moulding's songs initially came out as weird imitations of what I was doing , but by the time of Drums and Wires, he really started to take off as a songwriter. He was more effused with Moulding's offerings for Skylarking, which included the highest ratio of Moulding songs for any XTC album. On Moulding's bass playing, Partridge praised his old fashioned tendency to match notes to the bass drum. In Song Stories, Neville Farmer comments that Partridge is the bosserratic but willful runs the band on instinct , while Moulding is the voice of calm ... a foil to Andy's radical side. Music journalist Peter Paphides felt that the songwriters' personalities couldn't seem more different, with Moulding phlegmatic, shy, and heartbreakingly pretty and Partridge an art school dropout ... uptight, dominating and extrovert. In Moulding's view, Partridge also typically acted as an executive producer for albums while frequently undermining the authority of the actual credited producer. Their recording approaches differed in that Moulding sometimes preferred spontaneous or imperfect performances, whereas Partridge working method was to refine a song through repeated takes. The band occasionally took to the term Andy ness to describe Partridge's studio indulgences. Despite this, they rarely found themselves encumbered by serious creative differences. In 1997, Moulding called one dispute over a Skylarking bass part the only real argument between him and Partridge in the band's history. Barry Andrews, XTC's keyboard player for their first two albums, emerged as a third solo songwriter on the group's second album Go 2. However, he left the band shortly thereafter. His replacement, guitarist Dave Gregory, did not contribute songs, but was the only one in the band who could score music, and frequently contributed orchestral arrangements. Moulding said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had no kind of foil to work with, as both musicians were drawn to dissonant harmonies used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out ... So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think. Starting in 1982, Gregory extended his talents to keyboards as well, since Partrige and Moulding were not adept to the instrument. Gregory never presented a completed idea for a song to the band partly because he felt intimidated by Partridge's scrutiny. Since he couldn't continue grinding out old blues cliches and power chords, he decided to think more in terms of the songs as the masters and the instruments as the servants. Discussing Gregory's contributions to the group, Farmer writes of a precision and correctness that carries through from his prerehearsal of guitar solos to ... his encyclopedic knowledge of guitars and who played what on which instrument with which amplifier in which studio on which record under the influence of what star sign or guru or drug. Terry Chambers was the band's original drummer. He was described by Partridge as the that's been the most primitive, but probably the most thrilling for inventiveness, because he would blunder into . One of his characteristic techniques was the use of hi chat chokes. Following his departure in 1983, the group employed a succession of session drummers for their studio recordings. This included Pete Phipps Mummer and The Big Express , Prairie Prince Skylarking and Apple Venus , Pat Mastelotto Oranges Lemons , and Dave Mattacks Nonsuch . Drum machines also began to be incorporated into the group's sound. None of the studio drummers were accepted as official members of the band. Partridge explained that this was because the group did not tour and because There's lots of local, interpersonal language that means nothing to anybody outside the band and is very difficult to bring people into. Andy Partridge, 1981 In the mid 1970s, XTC played in London punk scenes and were consistent with music of the new wave, albeit with a heavy ska influence. Partridge felt that their music was pop from the beginning, not punk or new wave as is often suggested, and that the terms in themselves are redundant of pop . As they became more of a studio band, their material grew progressively more complex. Later, XTC were sometimes suggested as being a prog band. Partridge did not feel the band were prog and expressed hesitancy with the word progressive , saying that he preferred to call the band exploratory pop in the same vein as the Beatles or the Kinks. In his words, Prog is just longer pop songs. Over the next few years, XTC began showcasing their vintage psychedelic influences through the use of Mellotron and backwards tape recordings on the albums Mummer and The Big Express. In 1987, he acknowledged that the group had really changed personality. We didn't notice it bit by bit but over 10 years, suddenly it seems, wow, we're different. The band's early influences included disco, dub reggae, music hall, the Beatles, Free, the Kinks, Captain Beefheart, the Stooges, the New York Dolls, Cockney Rebel, Motown, Can, David Bowie, the Groundhogs, Black Sabbath, and the organ dominated records of Johnny and the Hurricanes. The New York Dolls' single Jet Boy was a particular favorite for XTC. Partridge denied in 2019 that the Velvet Underground were an influence, but in 1984 expressed a fondness for things with pounding piano, everything from Velvet Underground's 'I'm Waiting for My Man', to things that people like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones did at any time I just love banana fingers piano. Moreso than Partridge, Moulding was fond of heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep, as well as Deep Purple, Cream, and Free. XTC were not initially public with their influences due to the punk scene's anathema toward stating one's influences. Pitchfork writer Chris Dahlen characterised the band's original sound as punk meets Buddy Holly on amphetamines ... danceable enough for the crowds at the clubs, and suspiciously poppy thanks to the catchy hooks and their trademark verse chorus verse chorus explode pattern. Partridge said that he adopted a vocal style out of fear that we weren't going to make another record ... and people weren't going to be left with any impression of the singer . He described it as a walrus or seal bark that amalgamated Buddy Holly's hiccup , Elvis Presley's vibrato, and the howled mannerisms of Steve Harley. In reference to the energy of the band's performances which drew comparisons with the Talking Heads , Partridge remembered how they used to fucking kill ourselves. I think it was fear. It was fear manifested in ludicrously high energy music. It was like 1000 whaaahh All of the songs were run together and it was really uptempo stuff. According to Moulding, any kinship with punk was gone after 1979's Motown influenced Life Begins at the Hop . Of his guitar technique, Partridge said that it evolved from his desire to be a drummer, to chop and slash and try to work between what the drums were doing, a so I could be heard, and b because I liked the funk and I liked working the holes that the drums left. He was particularly influenced by John French, the drummer for Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, although he disliked that the drummer's groove would change every few bars. Gregory attributed XTC's unorthodox drum patterns to Partridge's affinity for dub and reggae He's got a great innate sense of rhythm. He'll say 'No, don't put that beat there, why don't you come down on 3 instead of 2 on this part here ' ... He never put where you'd expect to find them. Producer Chris Hughes likened the band's fashion of playing guitar to an automated music sequencer. The Beach Boys' 1968 rendition of Bluebirds Over the Mountain was one of the first records Partridge bought with his own money. Although it is widely assumed that the Beach Boys influenced XTC throughout their career, Partridge stated that he was originally only familiar with singles such as I Get Around 1964 and Good Vibrations 1967 which were an enormous influence for him. It was not until 1986 that he discovered that the Beach Boys had an album career, when he first heard Smiley Smile 1967 in its entirety. Moulding credited the arrival of Dave Gregory with reviving Partridge's interest in 1960s bands like the Kinks. However, Partridge similarly only knew of the Kinks through the group's 1960s singles, and did not listen to any of their albums until the late 1980s. Partridge also claimed that the Beatles were the farthest thing from my mind until 1982 at another time he stated that the opening F chord on XTC's 1978 single This Is Pop was directly based on the opening chord from the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night 1964 . Discussing the recording of the Mummer track Ladybird , Partridge recalled that he told producer Steve Nye that he was afraid people would think he was copying the Beatles, to which Nye's response was Who gives a fuck Partridge said that from that moment onward, I started to recognise that those songwritersthe Ray Davieses, the Lennons and McCartneys, the Brian Wilsonshad gone into my head really deeply. He later considered Rook 1992 , Wrapped in Grey 1992 and Easter Theatre 1999 to be the perfect songs of his career, feeling that he had exorcized a lot of those kind of Lennon and McCartney, Bacharach and David, Brian Wilson type ghosts out of my system by doing all that. Reportedly, when Brian Wilson was played the Dukes' Pale and Precious , a pastiche of the Beach Boys, he thought it was styled after Paul McCartney. John Harris, 2010 XTC are noted for their Englishness . Partridge denied that this was conscious on his part I don't try to be English. I guess because I am English, it comes out English. But I don't sit down and think, Cor blimey, can I put a union jack and a beefeater's outfit on, Mary British music critic John Harris identified Partridge's XTC compositions as within the same lineage of rural English songwriting invented by Ray Davies of the Kinks, and followed by the Jam, the Specials, scores of half forgotten punk and new wave bands, the Smiths and mid 1990s Britpop. In Partridge's opinion, the band never got beyond Swindon. He also felt that XTC being described as pastoral was a compliment 'Pastoral' to me means being more in touch with the country than the city, which I think we are. London gives me the willies. Lyrically, he cited Ray Davies, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney as his biggest influences. According to biographer Neville Farmer, Partridge and Moulding tended to write about more general aspects of their lives and their attitudes . Farmer added that Colin nor Andy handle political or religious matters with subtlety. If they have an idea about something, they say it straightforwardly. They are no more embarrassed about their view on the world than Andy is about his sex life. That makes them easy targets for criticism. For Partridge, other popular subject matter included financial shortage, factory work, comic book characters, seafaring, war, and ancient rituals. He described himself as an atheist and said he did not become interested in politics until circa 1979, when he voted for Margaret Thatcher purely because she was a woman. I was that naive. Now I'm very left. Writing for AllMusic, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine recognises the group thusly XTC was one of the smartest and catchiest British pop bands to emerge from the punk and new wave explosion of the late '70s. ... While popular success has eluded them in both Britain and America, the group has developed a devoted cult following in both countries that remains loyal over two decades after their first records. ... XTC's lack of commercial success isn't because their music isn't accessible their bright, occasionally melancholy, melodies flow with more grace than most bands it has more to do with the group constantly being out of step with the times. However, the band has left behind a remarkably rich and varied series of albums that make a convincing argument that XTC is the great lost pop band. XTC were one of the progenitors of Britpop, were influential to later power pop acts such as Jellyfish and the Apples in Stereo, and anticipated the indie art pop bands of the 2000s. They also inspired tribute bands, tribute albums, fan conventions, and fansites. Dave Gregory said that he became aware of XTC's huge influence on American acts through his interactions with musicians in the late 1980s. XTC also had a significant influence and cult following in Japan. By the late 1980s, they were supported by three dedicated fanzines in as many countries. Between 1979 and 1992, they had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40. The band are often compared reverentially to 1960s acts such as the Who, the Kinks, and most frequently, the Beatles. In a 1991 article that focused on a resurgence of power pop groups, members of Jellyfish and the Posies reflected that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. As the Posies' Jon Auer said our '60s ish ness is actually early '80s ish ness, a pop sensibility that came from listening to Squeeze and XTC . Acts such as Kula Shaker, the Shamen and the Stone Roses recruited engineer John Leckie chiefly because of his productions for the retro psychedelic Dukes of Stratosphear records. According to Neville Farmer, the name XTC inspired the names of U2, R.E.M., and INXS. Japanese band Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her was named after the XTC song of similar title. Peter Gabriel is quoted I've always looked to XTC for inventive songwriting, innovative production, and a sense of humor. It's their strong blend of personalities that make them one of the great British bands. Discussing the band's relative obscurity and lack of financial success, Schabe said that it's difficult to justify claims of greatness without trying to understand exactly why they never managed to rise above the status of cult band. Respect and recognition are the real validation of such claims . Andy Partridge characterized the band as quietly influential and thought that the decision to quit touring definitely affected our popularity later on . Schabe disagreed that the lack of touring had an effect and wrote that XTC suffered more from the hands of industry forces than they did from failure to find an audience. Partridge also estimated that XTC's fan demographic had a male female ratio of about 6040, which was reassuring to him, as he thought the band only appealed to computer nerds . In the 1981 edition of Rolling Stone's Book of Rock Lists, XTC were ranked number 15 for its list of the 17 Loudest Bands in the World , ahead of Queen and Kiss. XTC were the only group besides the Stranglers to emerge from the punk scene with a keyboardist. Journalist Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club wrote that their style of post punk guitar pop became popular in the early 2000s among bands such as Kaiser Chiefs, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, and Bloc Party. During the decade, there was a reevaluation of post punk Shabe wrote that it led to XTC being revered in association with the groundbreakers of that era. Musicologist Alex Ogg listed XTC as one of several unheralded events in the history of post punk, while Eric Klinger of PopMatters posited You might not hear of bands talking about XTC as a big influence the way they talk about, say, Gang of Four, but they were certainly in the mix that became the music that was to come. Despite their Englishness , the group's fanbase has been more concentrated in the US than the UK. They refused to conform to punk's simplicity, a point that the British press initially criticised. Partridge believed we were trying to push music into a new area. And so we had to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous name calling because we refused to just play stupid. He recalled that when he played at a jam session with punk bands in the late 1970s, the drummer from X Ray Spex shouted Oh, you can fucking play, can you Oh, listen to him, he can play. In 1988, writer Chris Hunt observed that XTC have largely not found favour in their homeland. To a nation that judges success in terms of tabloid coverage and appearances on Top Of The Pops, the retiring bards of rural olde England didn't really strike too loud a chord with the record buying public. XTC had just become 'too weird' for their own good. Musician and journalist Dominique Leone argued that they deserved more than they ever got. From the press, the public, their label, and various managers, XTC have been a tragically under appreciated band in every sense. Swindon did not have a respected music scene as others in Britain. Partridge cited the group's origins as the main reason for their ill repute if we came from a big city like London or Manchester, we would have probably have been heralded as more godlike. In another interview, he suggested that both their small town origins and the British class system were reasons for a lack of appreciation in their native country XTC were clever and came from Swindon, so therefore we were crap... I was always jealous of bands like Talking Heads, who were doing similar things to us but were from New York, and therefore cool. But the English don't like normal people doing intelligent things. He remembered the group being advised by their early management to change their accents and deny their Swindon origins, but we thought it was a badge of honour, coming from the comedy town.

"Xtort stylized as XTOT is the ninth studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on 25 June 1996 by Wax Trax Records. It was recorded from the end of 1995 through early 1996, shortly after the death of Wax Trax co founder and band friend Jim Nash. Xtort features a variety of guest artists from the industrial music scene and studio musicians from other genres, but includes limited participation from core member En Esch. The album was massively promoted by KMFDM's American label TVT Records, which pressed tens of thousands of copies of its lead single Power . Frontman Sascha Konietzko created his own form of promotion, issuing a press release that both disparaged and lauded the coming set. Xtort was generally well received by critics, with many calling it superlative, and is the highest charting KMFDM album to date. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007. In late 1995, KMFDM had completed the Beat by Beat and In Your Face tours in support of their last album, Nihil. KMFDM frontman and founder Sascha Konietzko described Nihil as the crown , and said the band had come as close to mainstream popularity as he wanted. He felt the band needed to move away from its success. In 2007, Konietzko recalled that he had hated all the attention, interviews, photo shoots, etc. . After the tours, Konietzko returned to Chicago in order to be with his friend Jim Nash, co founder of Wax Trax Records, who was dying from AIDS. Konietzko referred to the death of Nash that October as the end of an era . En Esch, one of the longtime core members of KMFDM, had almost nothing to do with Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving I had to do it without him. He also said the two were not in communication around the time of the album's release. Xtort was pre produced and tracked in Seattle at Hole in the Wall Studio, and recorded and mixed in Chicago at Chicago Recording Company. Konietzko contacted F. M. Einheit and had him come to Chicago in January 1996 to work on some tracks together. Konietzko also brought in a number of Wax Trax alumni, such as Chris Connelly of Revolting Cocks and Bill Rieflin of Ministry, to help with the album's creation, along with assistance from more than a dozen studio musicians. Konietzko required all the album's contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production, saying I don't care what they do on their own time, but when they do KMFDM, if they don't comply with the schedule, they're out. Konietzko said the ideas for songs began with individual sounds, which he then modified until he created a looped rhythm. Craze , for example, Konietzko called an homage to Atari Teenage Riot, a band with two guys, one girl, a couple TR90S drum machines and a bass machine. He said he was inspired by touring with the band in Europe in support of Nihil in 1995. After creating the base tunes, the songs went to Gunter Schulz, another longtime member, to add guitars. With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly, to pick songs they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation. For Xtort, Konietzko used Macintosh products to do all the synchronization. Connelly contributed to four tracks, including Blame , which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group Tower of Power. Nicole Blackman, KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals to the track Dogma , which was adapted from the ten minute live performance she provided while touring with the band. Power , meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, Wax Trax , for a radio promo song. Konietzko said he'd heard radio didn't like big female choruses , so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson to help with the song, which he called dumb and catchy . The hidden track of the album, Fairy , is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s. Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's dirty fantasies . He also said it was not a serious track it was more like kids at play . For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schulz played piano. The first track on the album, Power , was featured on the Wax Trax Summer Swindle , a cassette sampler included with 45,000 issues of the July 1996 issue of Alternative Press. Another 50,000 copies of the sampler were to be handed out at summer college and beach events and given away at radio stations. 90,000 pre release posters and information sheets were mailed out to fans. Blackman wrote the promotional piece for the album's press kit, and at Konietzko's request, wrote the first half of the promo as an insulting take down of the album rather than as a standard promo. The first letter of each line of the first section of the promo spelled out the phrase April Fools Day Fucker and included lines such as It's been 100 years and fifty albums for the German American rock squadare they running out of gas or what and KMFDM can't suck hard enough , a quote from the track Inane . The second half of the promo included phrases such as XTORT is a supersonic soundtrack and The new album is the sound of a band at the height of their powers. Carrie Borzillo of Billboard stated KMFDM was poised to make a significant commercial breakthrough. Konietzko said at the time there were no plans to tour in support of the album's release. He later said this was due to the fact that the band as a touring unit had ceased to exist. Xtort was released on June 25, 1996 on Wax Trax TVT on cassette, CD, and vinyl. The album was also released in CD format in Europe and Japan. In addition to being the first KMFDM album to chart in the Billboard 200, staying there for three weeks and peaking at No. 92 the week of July 13, 1996, Xtort sold over 200,000 copies, making it one of the band's best selling albums. The song Son of a Gun was made into an animated video by visual artist Aidan Brute Hughes, who also did the album's cover artwork. On March 6, 2007, Metropolis Records released a digitally remastered version of the album on CD and MP3. Looking back on the album at the time of its re release, Konietzko said it was his favorite album of the 1990s. Reviews for Xtort were almost universally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it the heaviest and most danceable disc in KMFDM's 12 year career while giving it an A . Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting hit with a wrecking ball, saying, When KMFDM does what it does best, it is the best at what it does, namely jack hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power. Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album the product of a first rate lineup, and praised the album's diversity, saying, The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist. Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun Times gave the album an essential rating, and said, KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, it would be nice to hear branch out and start to experiment a little bit more , and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best. Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs. Larry Flick of Billboard said Power , the opening track, finds front man Sascha Konietzko snarling and growling with palpable force, while Cheryl Wilson softens the edges with splashes of soul mama vamping during the chorus. Williams called the song irresistible . Masuo noted in particular the use of horns and the Hammond B3 organ, and concluded by stating, In their insidiously arty and intellectually sassy music, KMFDM continue to bring diverse elements together to create a unified whole. Armstrong called Dogma a song that crossed over from being industrial to frightening , while MacDonald described it as blistering and Williams said it was captivating . Armstrong said Son of a Gun was the album's truly explosive track , but Williams thought Inane was the best song. All information from 2007 release CD booklet.

"Xu Lai Chinese WadeGiles Hsu Lai 1909 4 April 1973 was a Chinese film actress, socialite, and World War II secret agent. Known as the Standard Beauty , she was active in the film industry for only three years, and quit acting after the suicide of the great star Ruan Lingyu in 1935. Her first husband was Li Jinhui, the Father of Chinese pop music . During the Second Sino Japanese War, Xu and her second husband, Lieutenant General Tang Shengming, ostensibly served under the Japanese controlled Nanking puppet regime, but secretly worked as agents for the Republic of China resistance based in Chungking. With the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, Xu and Tang defected to the People's Republic of China, but were severely persecuted during the Cultural Revolution 196676 . Xu Lai died in prison in 1973 her husband survived and lived until 1987. Xu Lai was born 1909 to a poor family in Shanghai. Her original name was Xu Xiaomei and she was also called Xu Jiefeng . Due to poverty, she began working at a British owned egg factory in Zhabei at the age of 13, but was later able to attend school after her family fortunes improved. In 1927, Xu attended the China Song and Dance School run by Li Jinhui, who is now considered the Father of Chinese pop music . She also joined Li's Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe and toured many cities in China and Southeast Asia. She married Li, who was 18 years her senior, in 1930, and gave birth to a daughter named Xiaofeng. 73 In 1932, Xu Lai was recruited by Zhou Jianyun, a cofounder of the Mingxing Film Company, to join the studio. She became famous after starring in the 1933 silent film Remnants of Spring , in which she appeared in probably the earliest female bath scene in the history of Chinese cinema. Later that year she starred in A Feather on Mount Tai . In 1934, she starred in Cheng Bugao's popular patriotic films Romance of Mount Hua and Go Northwest . Xu Lai, together with Wang Renmei and Li Lili, her former colleagues at the Bright Moon Troupe, were the earliest stars to portray the vibrant, wholesome, and sexy country girl prototype, which became one of the most popular figures in Chinese cinema, and later inherited by the cinema of Hong Kong. Xu became widely known as the Standard Beauty , and a ceremony was held to crown her the Beauty Queen of the Far East . The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association strongly disapproved of her coronation . Among the objections raised was that she shocked the public by exhibiting herself in the nude , referring to her bath scene. The suicide of actress Ruan Lingyu in 1935, which caused three other women to commit suicide during her 3 miles 4.8 km long funeral procession, had a major impact on Xu Lai. She quit acting after finishing her last film, The Boatman's Daughter , directed by Shen Xiling. It was critically acclaimed and considered her best film. The sudden death of her daughter Xiaofeng, also in 1935, caused a breakdown of her marriage with Li Jinhui and the couple divorced in November of that year. It was an acrimonious divorce and Li requested compensation for the investment he had made in training her. In 1936, Xu Lai married Tang Shengming , a Kuomintang Lieutenant General from a prominent Hunanese family. Tang was a notorious playboy and a close friend of Dai Li, chief of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Juntong , the secret service of the Republic of China. Xu's assistant Zhang Suzhen , a Juntong secret agent, became Tang's concubine, and Shanghai tabloids often reported salacious stories of the three sharing the same bed. Tang made sure that Xu Lai introduced Dai Li to the movie queen Hu Die, who later became the spy chief's mistress. A year after her wedding, the Second Sino Japanese War erupted. The Imperial Japanese Army attacked Shanghai in August 1937, and the national capital Nanking in December. Tang's older brother, General Tang Shengzhi, was the chief commander of the doomed defense of Nanking, which resulted in the Nanking Massacre. Tang Shengming, meanwhile, was the deputy commander of Changsha and chief commander of Changde, both in Hunan province. In 1940, Tang Shengming surrendered to the Japanese and was recruited to serve in the Reorganized National Government of China the Wang Jingwei regime , a puppet government established by Japan in occupied Nanking. Tang was appointed the commander of public security of Jiangsu province, 390 while Xu was his socialite wife who became a close friend with the wives of Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and Zhou Fohai, the top leaders of the puppet regime. They were widely condemned by the Chinese public as traitors, and Tang Shengzhi publicly renounced all relationship with his brother and sister in law. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, the Kuomintang government revealed that Tang Shengming and Xu Lai had been sent by Dai Li to serve as secret agents in the Wang Jingwei regime. The couple took great personal risks to obtain intelligence about Japanese spies and troop movements and pass it to the resistance. Xu Lai reportedly discovered the identity of a Japanese spy while playing mahjong with Zhou Fohai's wife, and personally delivered messages to Chinese agents in Shanghai in urgent situations. In 1949, as it was becoming clear that Mao Zedong's Communists were winning the Chinese Civil War, Xu Lai moved her family from Shanghai to British Hong Kong, while Tang Shengming went to Changsha to join the surrender of Hunan Governor Cheng Qian to the Communists. His brother Tang Shengzhi also surrendered. In 1950, Tang Shengming was appointed deputy commander of 21st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army and fought battles against the Kuomintang troops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. In 1956, Tang was appointed a counsellor of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and Xu Lai moved with her husband to Beijing. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, Mao's wife Jiang Qing, who had been a minor actress in Shanghai during the 1930s, began persecuting many of her former colleagues who were familiar with her bourgeois past. 81 Xu Lai and her husband were both imprisoned for unfounded criminal charges. On 4 April 1973, 374 Xu died in prison after years of torture and maltreatment, at the age of 64. 81 Tang survived the tumultuous period, and lived until 1987.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu%20Lai%20%28actress%29
"Xu Shunshou Chinese WadeGiles Hsu Shun shou 21 August 1917 6 January 1968 was a Chinese aircraft designer and a founder of the aircraft manufacturing industry in the People's Republic of China. He was the founding director of the PRC's first aircraft design organization later the Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute , where he oversaw the development of the Shenyang JJ 1, the first jet aircraft designed in China. He trained many of the country's top aircraft designers and also participated in the design of the Nanchang CJ 6 trainer, the Nanchang Q 5 jet attack aircraft, and the Xian H 6 bomber. He was severely persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and died at the age of 50. Xu Shunshou was born on 21 August 1917 in Shanghai, Republic of China, the youngest child of Xu Yibing, an educator and a member of Sun Yat sen's revolutionary group Tongmenghui. When he was three, his family returned to their hometown Nanxun, in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province. He lost his father at a young age. In 1930, Xu attended secondary school in Nanjing, then China's capital. Two years later, the January 28 incident broke out and the Japanese army attacked Shanghai and threatened Nanjing. For safety, Xu transferred to the missionary Kashing High School now Xiuzhou High School in Jiaxing, near his hometown. Xu entered the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University in 1933. Upon graduation four years later with a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering, he briefly worked at the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, before entering the special aviation mechanics program of the National Central University in Nanjing. The Second Sino Japanese War soon broke out in July 1937 and Nanjing fell to Japanese occupation. The National Central University relocated to Chongqing, China's wartime capital. Upon graduation in March 1939, Xu joined the Republic of China Air Force and served at the technical research office of the air force's aviation committee in Chengdu. In 1942, Xu was sent by the Kuomintang government to work and train at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation in the United States, where he participated in the design of jet interceptors. After the end of World War II, Xu returned to China and worked at the No. 2 Aircraft Manufacturing Factory in Chongqing later moved back to Nanchang after the war . When the Communist Party defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Xu stayed in mainland China and worked for the Aviation Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. As the PRC was receiving technical assistance from the Soviet Union, Xu taught himself Russian and translated several Russian books on aircraft engineering into Chinese. In 1954, he oversaw the manufacture of the Nanchang CJ 5 trainer aircraft, which was based on the Soviet Yakovlev Yak 18. In August 1956, the Aviation Industry Bureau established the PRC's first airplane design office at Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, with Xu Shunshou as its director designer, Huang Zhiqian and Ye Zhengda as deputy directors. Xu led a team of 108 people, whose average age was only 22. Most team members were recent university graduates, and only three people Xu, Huang, and Lu Xiaopeng, had any aircraft design experience. The team's first task was to design a subsonic jet trainer, the Shenyang JJ 1. It was chosen because the PLA Air Force needed to train jet fighter pilots, and Shenyang Aircraft needed a relatively easy project to train its inexperienced designers. The project started in October 1956, and the plane took its maiden flight less than two years later, on 26 July 1958. According to GlobalSecurity.org, the development cycle was less than half that of similar planes designed in Japan and Czechoslovakia and the performance was superior. The development of the JJ 1 marked a new era of China's aircraft manufacturing industry, and a number of Xu's team members, including Gu Songfen, Guan De, Tu Jida, Chen Yijian , and Feng Zhongyue , later became China's top aircraft designers. After the JJ 1, Xu participated in the design of the Nanchang CJ 6 trainer, the Nanchang Q 5 jet attack aircraft, and the Xian H 6 bomber. He also designed wind tunnels used for aircraft development. In May 1964, Xu was abruptly transferred from Shenyang to the 603 Design Institute of the Xi'an Aircraft Company in Yanliang, Shaanxi. At the time, the 603 Institute had few technical experts and no well defined development goal. He designed an air conditioning system for the Ilyushin Il 28 bomber and its Chinese version, the Harbin H 5, but mainly focused on training engineers and translating and writing technical literature. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Xu was summoned back to Shenyang Aircraft in June, where he was denounced as a capitalist academic authority . He was subject to almost a year of struggle sessions, although he still had time to read and translate technical documents. In April 1967, Xu received permission to return to the 603 Institute, and thought his ordeal was over. On the contrary, as the country descended into deeper chaos, he was labelled a capitalist reactionary authority , capitalist roader , and anti Communist spy . Soon after returning to Yanliang, he was imprisoned and repeatedly tortured. On 6 January 1968, after undergoing a final round of torture, he died at age 50. Xu was politically rehabilitated after the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. The No. 1 Aircraft Research Institute the former 603 Institute erected a bronze statue of him on its campus in Yanliang, and established the Xu Shunshou Science and Technology Progress Award in his memory. On 19 May 2005, the first anniversary of the establishment of Tsinghua University School of Aerospace Engineering, a life size marble statue of Xu was dedicated in the main building of the school. In 2008, the China Aviation Industry Press published Xu's biography, written by Shi Yuanguang and Xu's former trainee, academician Gu Songfen. Xu was the youngest of five siblings. His brother, Xu Chi, was a famous writer known for his popular biographies of Chen Jingrun and Li Siguang. His third sister, Xu He , was the wife of Wu Xiuquan, who served as Vice Foreign Minister of China. Xu married Song Shubi in 1946, whom he had met four years before while working in Chengdu. She was a writer and translator known for her Chinese translation of Aylmer Maude's The Life of Tolstoy. The couple had three children. Their daughter, Xu Fan , was an official of the World Tourism Organization of the United Nations. Their elder son, Xu Wen , was still in middle school when Xu Shunshou died. He worked in a brick factory for eight years, and entered college after the Cultural Revolution and became an aerospace engineer. Their youngest son, Xu Yuan , became a tenured professor of mathematics at an American university.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu%20Shunshou
"Xue Susu Chinese also known as Xue Wu, Xuesu, Sunjung among other pen names c.15641650 C.E. was a Chinese courtesan. Known as one of the Eight Great Courtesans of the Ming Dynasty , she was an accomplished painter and poet, and was noted for her skill at mounted archery. She was particularly noted for her figure paintings, which included many Buddhist subjects. Her works are held in a number of museums both in China and elsewhere. Her archery was commented upon by a number of contemporary writers, as were her masculine, martial tendencies these were regarded as an attractive feature by the literati of the period. She lived in Eastern China, residing for most of her life in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu districts. After a career as a celebrated courtesan in Nanjing, Xue married several times, but none of these unions lasted. During her later life, she eventually opted for the life of a Buddhist recluse. Xue was born in either Suzhou or Jiaxing contemporary sources disagree . According to the historian Qian Qianyi she spent at least some of her childhood in Beijing. She spent her professional life in the Qinhuai pleasure quarter of Nanjing in the 1580s, where she became something of a celebrity among the literati and government officials who frequented the flower houses there. She was highly selective in her clientele, accepting only learned and scholarly men as her lovers and declining to proffer her affections for mere financial gain suitors might spend thousands of taels on her to no avail. In the 1590s she returned to Beijing, where the parties and literary gatherings that she hosted, as well as her archery demonstrations, further cemented her reputation. Xue referred to herself as a female knight errant , and took her name from a famous woman warrior from history she also chose the sobriquet Wulang fifth young gentleman as a nickname. The female knight errant epithet was reiterated by both the bibliophile Hu Yinglin and Fan Yulin, Secretary to the Ministry of War. Apparently fond of martial causes, she was not above using her position to influence military affairs, on one occasion abandoning her lover Yuan Baode when he refused to fund an expedition against the Japanese in Korea. At some point after 1605 her career as a courtesan came to an end when she married the playwright and bureaucrat Shen Defu. She was married several times making many of the proposals herself but none of these unions lasted. As well as Shen Defu, her husbands included General Li Hualong, art critic Li Rihua and, in later life, an unnamed but wealthy merchant from Suzhou. Although she wanted children, she was never able to have any. In later life she converted to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely retiring from the world. Even in her eighties, however, she was still active in the literary world, entertaining female artists such as Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake after the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin , she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so it is evident that she must have died before this date. Already an accomplished painter in her teenage years, Xue was well known for her artistic talent. Her work was considered similar to that of Chen Chun. One of her paintings was considered the most accomplished work of its kind in the whole of the Ming period , and contemporary art critics regarded her as a master of technique . Hu Yinglin considered her to be at the pinnacle of contemporary painting, asking, What famous painter with skilled hands can surpass her and claiming that ... surpasses anyone in the painting of bamboo and orchids. She was also keenly admired by eminent painter and art critic Dong Qichang, who was inspired to copy the entire Heart Sutra in response to Xue's painting of the bodhisattva Guanyin he claimed that None of Xue Susu's works lacks an intention and spirit that approaches the divine. Although she painted the standard subjects of landscapes, bamboo and blossoms being particularly fond of orchids , Xue was noted for her work in figure painting, which was a comparatively unusual artistic topic for courtesans to address. Examples of her paintings are displayed at the Honolulu Museum of Art and the San Francisco Asian Art Museum. Xue regularly accented her paintings with her own poems, and published two volumes of writing, only one of which is still extant. Hua suo shi Chinese Trifles about Flowers is a collection of short prose essays and anecdotes about various flowers, whilst Nan you cao Chinese Notes from a Journey to the South , which has been lost, apparently contained a selection of her poems regarding life as a courtesan. A number of these were collected in various anthologies from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Hu Yinglin wrote that Her poetry, although lacking in freedom, shows a talent rare among women. Moving in literary circles, Xue also provided the subject matter for many contemporary poets. Xu Yuan, another female poet of the period, describes Xue's allure Lotus blossoms as she moves her pair of arches Her tiny waist, just a hand's breadth, is light enough to dance on a palm Leaning coyly against the East Wind Her pure colour and misty daintiness fill the moon. Hu Yinglin wrote of Xue Who transplanted this flower of renowned species to the Imperial garden Hers is a smile worth a thousand pieces of gold She lives near the mooring like Taoye , under the wind She resembles rushes, standing in the water, embracing the moon, and humming The red phoenix is half raised because of her mate Her eyebrows are slightly frowning, expecting a heart to share This is the moment to read Eternal Regret, the poem of Bo Juyi Beside the bed, she is awaiting the lute of jade. Xue's own works deal with a variety of themes, from the mildy erotic Inside the city walls of stone in the pleasure quarter I feel deeply mortified that my talents outshine all the others The river glitters, the waters clear, and the seagulls swim in pairs The sky looks hollow, the clouds serene, and the wild geese fly in rows My embroidered dress partly borrows the hue of hibiscus The emerald wine shares the scent of lotus If I did not reciprocate your feelings Would I dare to feast with you, Master He to the romantic This lovely night I think of you, wondering whether you will return The lonely lamp shines on me, casting a faint shadow I clutch one lone pillow there is nobody to talk to Moonlight floods the deserted courtyard tears soak my dress. to the whimsically philosophical Full of aroma is the taste of wine beneath the bloom Tinged in azure the gate surrounded by bamboo In solitude I watch the seagulls fly across the sky Carefree and content, I feel fully satisfied. Xue often exchanged poems and paintings with her clientele, receiving their own artworks in exchange. Whilst she excelled at poetry, painting and embroidery, the skill that set Xue apart from other courtesans and created a cult of celebrity around her was her talent for archery. Her mastery of a traditionally masculine art gave her an air of androgyny that was considered highly attractive by the literati of the time. Having practiced in Beijing as a child she furthered her skills during a sojourn in the company of a military officer in the outlying regions of China. The horsemen of the local tribes there were impressed with her shooting, and she became something of a local celebrity. Later in life she gave public demonstrations in Hangzhou, which drew large audiences. Hu Yinglin describes one such performance She is able to shoot two balls from her crossbow one after another and make the second ball strike the first and break it in mid air.

"The XYZ Affair was a political and diplomatic episode in 1797 and 1798, early in the presidency of John Adams, involving a confrontation between the United States and Republican France that led to the Quasi War. The name derives from the substitution of the letters X, Y and Z for the names of French diplomats Jean Conrad Hottinguer X , Pierre Bellamy Y , and Lucien Hauteval Z in documents released by the Adams administration. An American diplomatic commission was sent to France in July 1797 to negotiate a solution to problems that were threatening to break out into war. The diplomats, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry, were approached through informal channels by agents of the French foreign minister, Talleyrand, who demanded bribes and a loan before formal negotiations could begin. Although such demands were not uncommon in mainland European diplomacy of the time, the Americans were offended by them, and eventually left France without ever engaging in formal negotiations. Gerry, seeking to avoid all out war, remained for several months after the other two commissioners left. His exchanges with Talleyrand laid groundwork for the eventual end to diplomatic and military hostilities. The failure of the commission caused a political firestorm in the United States when the commission's dispatches were published. It led to the undeclared Quasi War 17981800 . Federalists, who controlled both houses of Congress and held the presidency, took advantage of the national anger to build up the nation's military. They also attacked the Democratic Republicans for their pro French stance, and Gerry a nonpartisan at the time for what they saw as his role in the commission's failure. In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, relations between the new French Republic and U.S. federal government became strained. In 1792, France and the rest of Europe went to war, a conflict in which President George Washington declared American neutrality. However, both France and Great Britain, the major naval powers in the war, seized ships of neutral powers including those of the United States that traded with their enemies. With the Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, the United States reached an agreement on the matter with Britain that angered members of the Directory that governed France. The French Navy consequently stepped up its efforts to interdict American trade with Britain. By the end of Washington's presidency in early 1797, the matter was reaching crisis proportions. Shortly after assuming office on March 4, 1797, President John Adams learned that Charles Cotesworth Pinckney had been refused as U.S. minister because of the escalating crisis, and that American merchant ships had been seized in the Caribbean. In response, he called upon Congress to meet and address the deteriorating state of FrenchAmerican relations during a special session to be held that May. Popular opinion in the United States on relations with France was divided along largely political lines Federalists took a hard line, favoring a defensive buildup but not necessarily advocating war, while Democratic Republicans expressed solidarity with the republican ideals of the French revolutionaries and did not want to be seen as cooperating with the Federalist Adams administration. Vice President Thomas Jefferson, himself a republican, looked upon Federalists as monarchists who were linked to Britain and therefore hostile to American values. In late May 1797 Adams met with his cabinet to discuss the situation and to choose a special commission to France. Adams initially proposed that John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry join Pinckney on the commission, but his cabinet objected to the choice of Gerry because he was not a strong Federalist. Francis Dana was chosen instead of Gerry, but he declined to serve, and Adams, who considered Gerry one of the two most impartial men in America he himself being the other , submitted his name to the United States Senate in Dana's stead without consulting his cabinet. Adams, in introducing the matter to Congress, made a somewhat belligerent speech in which he called for a vigorous defense of the nation's neutrality and expansion of the United States Navy, but stopped short of calling for war against France. Congress approved this choice of commissioners, and Adams instructed them to negotiate similar terms to those that had been granted to Britain in the Jay Treaty. The commissioners were also instructed to refuse loans, but to be flexible in the arrangement of payment terms for financial matters. Marshall left for Europe in mid July to join Pinckney, with Gerry following a few weeks later. The political divisions in the commission's makeup were reflected in their attitudes toward the negotiations Marshall and Pinckney, both Federalists, distrusted the French, while Gerry who was then opposed to political parties was willing to be flexible and unhurried in dealing with them. The French Republic, established in 1792 at the height of the French Revolution, was by 1797 governed by a bicameral legislative assembly, with a five member Directory acting as the national executive. The Directory was undergoing both internal power struggles and struggles with the Council of Five Hundred, the lower chamber of the legislature. Ministerial changes took place in the first half of 1797, including the selection in July of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand as foreign minister. Talleyrand, who had recently spent a few years in the United States, was openly concerned about the establishment of closer ties between the U.S. and Britain. The Directory, generally not well disposed to American interests, became notably more hostile to them in September 1797, when an internal coup propelled several anti Americans into power. These leaders, and Talleyrand, viewed President Adams as hostile to their interests, but did not think that there was significant danger of war. In part based on advice imparted to French diplomats by Jefferson, Talleyrand decided to adopt a measured, slow pace to the negotiations. The American commission arrived in Paris in early October, and immediately requested a meeting with Talleyrand. After an initial brief meeting in which Talleyrand only provisionally accepted the commissioners' credentials , a longer meeting was held a week later. Talleyrand sought from the commissioners an explanation for the speech Adams had made in May, which had angered Directory members his motivation was to determine how favorably the commissioners were disposed to the negotiations. If they responded in an unfavorable manner, the Directory would refuse to accept their credentials. The commissioners first learned of Talleyrand's expected demand on October 14 through an indirect channel. They decided that no explanation would be given for Adams' speech. What followed were a series of meetings that took place outside formal diplomatic channels. On October 17, Nicholas Hubbard, an Englishman working for a Dutch bank used by the Americans and who came to be identified as W in the published papers , notified Pinckney that Baron Jean Conrad Hottinguer, whom Hubbard described only as a man of honor, wished to meet with him. Pinckney agreed, and the two men met the next evening. Hottinguer who was later identified as X relayed a series of French demands, which included a large loan to the French government and the payment of a 50,000 bribe to Talleyrand. Pinckney relayed these demands to the other commissioners, and Hottinguer repeated them to the entire commission, which curtly refused the demands, even though it was widely known that diplomats from other nations had paid bribes to deal with Talleyrand. Hottinguer then introduced the commission to Pierre Bellamy Y , whom he represented as being a member of Talleyrand's inner circle. Bellamy expounded in detail on Talleyrand's demands, including the expectation that you must pay a great deal of money. He even proposed a series of purchases at inflated prices of currency as a means by which such money could be clandestinely exchanged. The commissioners offered to send one of their number back to the United States for instructions, if the French would suspend their seizures of American shipping the French negotiators refused. Not long after this standoff, Talleyrand sent Lucien Hauteval Z to meet with Elbridge Gerry. The two men knew each other, having met in Boston in 1792. Hauteval assured Gerry of Talleyrand's sincerity in seeking peace, and encouraged him to keep the informal negotiations open. He reiterated the demands for a loan and bribe. A week later notably after the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio, which ended the five year War of the First Coalition between France and most of the other European powers , Hottinguer and Bellamy again met with the commission, and repeated their original demands, accompanied by threats of potential war, since France was at least momentarily at peace in Europe. Pinckney's response was famous No, no, not a sixpence The commissioners decided on November 1 to refuse further negotiations by informal channels. Publication of dispatches describing this series of meetings would form the basis for the later political debates in the United States. The commissioners soon discovered that only unofficial channels were open to them. Over the next several months, Talleyrand sent a series of informal negotiators to meet with and influence the commissioners. Some of the informal avenues were closed down Gerry, for instance, informed Hauteval that they could no longer meet, since Hauteval had no formal authority , and Talleyrand finally appeared in November 1797 at a dinner, primarily to castigate the Americans for their unwillingness to accede to the demand for a bribe. In late November, Talleyrand began maneuvering to separate Gerry from the other commissioners. He extended a social dinner invitation to Gerry, which the latter, seeking to maintain communications, planned to attend. The matter heightened distrust of Gerry by Marshall and Pinckney, who sought guarantees that Gerry would limit any representations and agreements he might consider. Despite seeking to refuse informal negotiations, all of the commissioners ended up having private meetings with some of Talleyrand's negotiators. The commissioners eventually divided over the issue of whether to continue informal negotiations, with the Federalists Marshall and Pinckney opposed, and Gerry in favor. This division was eventually clear to Talleyrand, who told Gerry in January 1798 that he would no longer deal with Pinckney. In February, Talleyrand gained approval from the Directory for a new bargaining position, and he maneuvered to exclude Marshall from the negotiations as well. The change in strategy alarmed a number of American residents of Paris, who reported the growing possibility of war. Around this time Gerry, at Talleyrand's insistence, began keeping secret from the other commissioners the substance of their meetings. All three commissioners met with Talleyrand informally in March, but it was clear that the parties were at an impasse. This appeared to be the case despite Talleyrand's agreement to drop the demand for a loan. Both sides prepared statements to be sent across the Atlantic stating their positions, and Marshall and Pinckney, frozen out of talks that Talleyrand would only conduct with Gerry, left France in April. Their departure was delayed due to a series of negotiations over the return of their passports in order to obtain diplomatic advantage, Talleyrand sought to force Marshall and Pinckney to formally request their return which would allow him to later claim that they broke off negotiations . Talleyrand eventually gave in, formally requesting their departure. Gerry, although he sought to maintain unity with his co commissioners, was told by Talleyrand that if he left France the Directory would declare war. Gerry remained behind, protesting the impropriety of permitting a foreign government to the person who should negotiate. He however remained optimistic that war was unrealistic, writing to William Vans Murray, the American minister to The Netherlands, that nothing but madness would cause the French to declare war. Gerry resolutely refused to engage in further substantive negotiations with Talleyrand, agreeing only to stay until someone with more authority could replace him, and wrote to President Adams requesting assistance in securing his departure from Paris. Talleyrand eventually sent representatives to The Hague to reopen negotiations with William Vans Murray, and Gerry finally returned home in October 1798. While the American diplomats were in Europe, President Adams considered his options in the event of the commission's failure. His cabinet urged that the nation's military be strengthened, including the raising of a 20,000 man army and the acquisition or construction of ships of the line for the navy. He had no substantive word from the commissioners until March 1798, when the first dispatches revealing the French demands and negotiating tactics arrived. The commission's apparent failure was duly reported to Congress, although Adams kept secret the mistreatment lack of recognition and demand for a bribe of the diplomats, seeking to minimize a warlike reaction. His cabinet was divided on how to react the general tenor was one of hostility toward France, with Attorney General Charles Lee and Secretary of State Timothy Pickering arguing for a declaration of war. Democratic Republican leaders in Congress, believing Adams had exaggerated the French position because he sought war, united with hawkish Federalists to demand the release of the commissioners' dispatches. On March 20, Adams turned them over, with the names of some of the French actors redacted and replaced by the letters W, X, Y, and Z. The use of these disguising letters led the business to immediately become known as the XYZ Affair. The release of the dispatches produced exactly the response Adams feared. Federalists called for war, and Democratic Republicans were left without an effective argument against them, having miscalculated the reason for Adams' secrecy. Despite those calls, Adams steadfastly refused to ask Congress for a formal war declaration. Congress nonetheless authorized the acquisition of twelve frigates, and made other appropriations to increase military readiness it also, on July 7, 1798, voted to nullify the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, and two days later authorized attacks on French warships. Federalists used the dispatches to question the loyalty of pro French Democratic Republicans this attitude contributed to the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, restricting the movements and actions of foreigners, and limiting speech critical of the government. Federalists were otherwise divided on the question of war, and the Democratic Republicans painted hawkish Federalists as warmongers seeking to undermine the republic by military means. Elbridge Gerry was placed in a difficult position upon his return to the United States. Federalists, spurred by John Marshall's accounts of their disagreements, criticized him for abetting the breakdown of the negotiations. These bitterly harsh and partisan comments turned Gerry against the Federalists, and he eventually ended up joining with the Democratic Republicans in 1800. When news reached France of the publication of the dispatches and the ensuing hostile reaction, the response was one of fury. Talleyrand was called to the Directory to account for his role in the affair. He denied all association with the informal negotiators, and enlisted the assistance of Gerry in exposing the agents whose names had been redacted, a charade Gerry agreed to participate in. In exchange Talleyrand confirmed privately to Gerry that the agents were in fact in his employ, and that he was, contrary to statements made to the Directory, interested in pursuing reconciliation. President Adams later wrote that Talleyrand's confession to Gerry was significant in his decision to continue efforts to maintain peace. Gerry, in his private report on the affair to Adams in 1799, claimed credit for maintaining the peace, and for influencing significant changes in French policy that lessened the hostilities and eventually brought a peace treaty. The warlike attitude of the United States and the start of the Quasi War a naval war between the two countries that was fought primarily in the Caribbean convinced Talleyrand that he had miscalculated in his dealings with the commissioners. In response to the diplomatic overtures he made to William Vans Murray in The Hague, President Adams sent negotiators to France in 1799 who eventually negotiated an end to hostilities with the Convention of 1800 whose negotiations were managed in part by Marshall, then Secretary of State in September 1800. This agreement was made with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, who had overthrown the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire in November 1799, and it was ratified by the United States Senate in December 1801.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ%20Affair
"Y Gododdin Welsh is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named Catraeth in about AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript, the Book of Aneirin. The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd Old North as such it would have been written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th, or 11th century. Even a 9th century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry. The Gododdin, known in Roman times as the Votadini, held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd. The poem tells how a force of 300 or 363 picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative. The manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations. One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions King Arthur in passing, which, if not an interpolation, would be the earliest known reference to that character. Only one early manuscript of Y Gododdin is known, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from the second half of the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A, while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost. Differences exist within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material show signs of partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder shows much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, but after a while tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas as they were in the older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources. The stanzas that make up the poem are a series of elegies for warriors who fell in battle against vastly superior numbers. Some of the verses refer to the entire host, and others eulogize individual heroes. They tell how the ruler of the Gododdin, Mynyddog Mwynfawr, gathered warriors from several Brythonic kingdoms and provided them with a year's feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn, before launching a campaign in which almost all of them were killed fighting against overwhelming odds. The poetry is based on a fixed number of syllables, though some irregularity occurs, which may be due to modernisation of the language during oral transmission. It uses rhyme, both end rhyme and internal, and some parts use alliteration. A number of stanzas may open with the same words, for example Gwyr a aeth gatraeth gan wawr Men went to Catraeth at dawn . The collection appears to have been compiled from two different versions according to some verses, there were 300 men of the Gododdin, and only one, Cynon ap Clydno, survived others have 363 warriors and three survivors, in addition to the poet, who as a bard, almost certainly would not have been counted as one of the warriors. The names of about 80 warriors are given in the poem. The Book of Aneirin begins with the introduction Hwn yw e gododin. Aneirin ae cant This is the Gododdin Aneirin sang it . The first stanza appears to be a reciter's prologue, composed after the death of Aneirin Gododdin, gomynaf oth blegyt yg gwyd cant en aryal en emwyt ... Er pan want maws mur trin, er pan aeth daear ar Aneirin, nu neut ysgaras nat a Gododin. Gododdin, I make claim on thy behalf In the presence of the throng boldly in the court ... Since the gentle one, the wall of battle, was slain, Since the earth covered Aneirin, Poetry is now parted from the Gododdin. The second stanza praises an individual hero In might a man, a youth in years,Of boisterous valour,Swift long maned steedsUnder the thigh of a handsome youth ...Quicker to a field of bloodThan to a weddingQuicker to the ravens' feast Than to a burial,A beloved friend was Ywain,It is wrong that he is beneath a cairn.It is a sad wonder to me in what landMarro's only son was slain. Other stanzas praise the entire host, for example number 13 Men went to Catraeth at mornTheir high spirits lessened their life spanThey drank mead, gold and sweet, ensnaring For a year the minstrels were merry.Red their swords, let the blades remainUncleansed, white shields and four sided spearheads,Before Mynyddog Mwynfawr's men. Mead is mentioned in many stanzas, sometimes with the suggestion that it is linked to their deaths. This led some 19th century editors to assume that the warriors went into battle drunk, however Williams explained that mead here stood for everything the warriors received from their lord. In return, they were expected to pay their mead by being loyal to their lord unto death. A similar concept is found in Anglo Saxon poetry. The heroes commemorated in the poem are mounted warriors there are many references to horses in the poem. There are references to spears, swords and shields, and to the use of armour llurug, from the Latin lorica . There are several references which indicate that they were Christians, for example penance and altar , while the enemy are described as heathens . Several of these features can be seen in stanza 33 Men went to Catraeth with a war cry,Speedy steeds and dark armour and shields,Spear shafts held high and spear points sharp edged, And glittering coats of mail and swords,He led the way, he thrust through armies,Five companies fell before his blades.Rhufawn His gave gold to the altar,And a rich reward to the minstrel. However, D. Simon Evans has suggested that most, if not all, of the references which point to Christianity may be later additions. Many personal names are given, but only two are recorded in other sources. One of the warriors was Cynon ap Clydno, whom Williams identifies with the Cynon ap Clydno Eiddin who is mentioned in old pedigrees. The other personal name recorded in other sources is Arthur. If the mention of Arthur formed part of the original poem this could be the earliest reference to Arthur, as a paragon of bravery. In stanza 99, the poet praises one of the warriors, Gwawrddur He fed black ravens on the rampart of a fortress Though he was no ArthurAmong the powerful ones in battleIn the front rank, Gwawrddur was a palisade Many of the warriors were not from the lands of the Gododdin. Among the places mentioned are Aeron, thought to be the area around the River Ayr and Elfed, the area around Leeds still called Elmet. Others came from further afield, for example one came from beyond Bannog , a reference to the mountains between Stirling thought to have been Manaw Gododdin territory and Dumbarton chief fort of the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde this warrior must have come from Pictland. Others came from Gwynedd in north Wales. Three of the stanzas included in the manuscript have no connection with the subject matter of the remainder except that they are also associated with southern Scotland or northern England rather than Wales. One of these is a stanza which celebrates the victory of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde under Eugein I, here described as the grandson of Neithon , over Domnall Brecc Dyfnwal Frych in Welsh , king of Dal Riata, at the Battle of Strathcarron in 642 I saw an array that came from Kintyre who brought themselves as a sacrifice to a holocaust.I saw a second who had come down from their settlement,who had been roused by the grandson of Neithon.I saw mighty men who came with dawn.And it was Domnall Brecc's head that the ravens gnawed. Another stanza appears to be part of the separate cycle of poems associated with Llywarch Hen. The third interpolation is a poem entitled Dinogad's Smock , a cradle song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript. According to Koch's reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde. The date of Y Gododdin has been the subject of debate among scholars since the early 19th century. If the poem was composed soon after the battle, it must predate 638, when the fall of Din Eidyn was recorded in the reign of Oswy king of Bernicia, an event which is thought to have meant the collapse of the kingdom of the Gododdin. If it is a later composition, the latest date which could be ascribed to it is determined by the orthography of the second part of Scribe B's text. This is usually considered to be that of the 9th or 10th centuries, although some scholars consider that it could be from the 11th century. Most of the debate about the date of the poem has employed linguistic arguments, mostly concerning rhyme since more is known about early Welsh phonology than other aspects of the language, like syntax . It is believed that around the time of the battle, the British language was transitioning into its daughter languages the primitive form of Welsh in Wales, of Cornish and Breton in southwestern Britain and Brittany, and Cumbric in northern Britain. Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of the changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 6th century. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd. Jackson suggested the name Primitive Cumbric for the dialect spoken at the time. Sweetser gives the example of the name Cynfelyn found in the Gododdin in British this would have been Cunobelinos. The middle unstressed o and the final unstressed os have been lost. Ifor Williams, whose 1938 text laid the foundations for modern scholarly study of the poetry, considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th century origin. This would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down. Dillon cast doubt on the date of composition, arguing that it is unlikely that by the end of the 6th century Primitive Welsh would have developed into a language not notably earlier than that of the ninth century . He suggests that the poetry may have been composed in the 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to Aneirin. Jackson however considers that there is no real substance in these arguments, and points out that the poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down, and would have been modernised by reciters, and that there is in any case nothing in the language used which would rule out a date around 600. Koch suggests a rather earlier date, about 570, and also suggests that the poem may have existed in written form by the 7th century, much earlier than usually thought. Koch, reviewing the arguments about the date of the poetry in 1997, states Today, the possibility of an outright forgery which would amount to the anachronistic imposition of a modern literary concept onto early Welsh tradition is no longer in serious contention. Rather, the narrowing spectrum of alternatives ranges from a Gododdin corpus which is mostly a literary creation of mediaeval Wales based on a fairly slender thread of traditions from the old Brittonic North to a corpus which is in large part recoverable as a text actually composed in that earlier time and place. Koch himself believes that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered that the language of the poem was 9th century rather than 6th century, and Isaac, writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century. The other approach to dating the poetry has been to look at it from a historical point of view. Charles Edwards writing in 1978 concluded that The historical arguments, therefore, suggest that the poem is the authentic work of Aneirin that we can establish the essential nature of the poem from the two surviving versions but that we cannot, except in favourable circumstances, establish the wording of the original. Dumville, commenting on these attempts to establish the historicity of the poem in 1988, said, The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven but that does not mean that it cannot be. Likewise, Patrick Sims Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later forgeries have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten . The poem is set in the area which is now southern Scotland and north east England. Around the year 600 this area included a number of Brythonic kingdoms. Apart from the Gododdin, the kingdom of Alt Clut occupied the Strathclyde area and Rheged covered parts of Galloway, Lancashire and Cumbria. Further south lay the kingdom of Elmet in the Leeds area. These areas made up what was later known in Welsh as Yr Hen Ogledd The Old North . The Gododdin, known as the Votadini in the Romano British period, occupied a territory from the area around the head of the Firth of Forth as far south as the River Wear. In modern terms their lands included much of Clackmannanshire and the Lothian and Borders regions. Their capital at this period may have been called Din Eidyn, now known as Edinburgh. By this time the area that later became Northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by the Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia. In the Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, there is a reference to several poets in this area during the 6th century. Having mentioned Ida of Bernicia, the founder of the Northumbrian royal line who ruled between 547 and 559, the Historia goes on to say At that time Talhaearn the Father of the Muse was famous in poetry, and Neirin, Taliesin, Blwchfardd and Cian who is called Gweinthgwawd, at one and the same time were renowned in British poetry. Nothing has been preserved of the work of Talhaearn, Blwchfardd and Cian, but poems attributed to Taliesin were published by Ifor Williams in Canu Taliesin and were considered by him to be comparable in antiquity to the Gododdin. This poetry praises Urien of Rheged and his son Owain, and refers to Urien as lord of Catraeth. Y Gododdin is not a narrative poem but a series of elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to the original listeners. The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself. There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem. The 19th century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified the Gododdin with the Votadini and Catraeth as Catterick in North Yorkshire. He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in c. 603 between King thelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under Aedan mac Gabrain, king of Dal Riada. Gwenogvryn Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098, emending the text to fit the theory. The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his Canu Aneirin first published in 1938. Williams interpreted mynydawc mwynvawr in the text to refer to a person, Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh. Mynyddog, in his version, was the king of the Gododdin, with his chief seat at Din Eidyn modern Edinburgh . Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors, some from as far afield as Gwynedd. He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year, then launched an attack on Catraeth, which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick, which was in Anglo Saxon hands. They were opposed by a larger army from the Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia. The battle at Catraeth has been seen as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles, who had probably by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria. This interpretation has been accepted by most modern scholars. Jackson accepts the interpretation but suggests that a force of 300 men would be much too small to undertake the task demanded of them. He considers that the 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by a larger number of foot soldiers, not considered worthy of mention in the poem. Jarman also follows Williams' interpretation. Jackson suggested that after the fall of the kingdom of Gododdin, in or about 638, the poem was preserved in Strathclyde, which maintained its independence for several centuries. He considers that it was first written down in Strathclyde after a period of oral transmission, and may have reached Wales in manuscript form between the end of the 8th and the end of the 9th century. There would be particular interest in matters relating to the Gododdin in Gwynedd, since the founding myth of the kingdom involved the coming of Cunedda Wledig from Manaw Gododdin. In 1997, John Koch published a new study of Y Gododdin which involved an attempt to reconstruct the original poetry written in what Koch terms Archaic Neo Brittonic . This work also included a new and very different interpretation of the background of the poetry. He draws attention to a poem in Canu Taliesin entitled Gweith Gwen Ystrat The Battle of Gwen Ystrat The men of Catraeth arise with the dayaround a battle victorious, cattle rich sovereignthis is Uryen by name, the most senior leader. There is also a reference to Catraeth in the slightly later poem Moliant Cadwallon, a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, thought to have been composed in about 633. Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth . He identifies Gwallawc as the Guallauc who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien. Koch draws attention to the mention of meibion Godebawc the sons of Godebog as an enemy in stanza 15 of the Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of Coil Hen Guotepauc . He considers that, in view of the references in the three poems, there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat. This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c. 600 favoured by Williams and others. He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Brythons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet, with Anglian allies on both sides, Rheged being in an alliance with Deira. He points out that according to the Historia Britonnum it was Rhun, son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanfld of Deira, her father Edwin and 12,000 of his subjects in 626 7. Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle. Mynyddog Mwynfawr was not a person's name but a personal description meaning 'mountain feast' or 'mountain chief'. Some aspects of Koch's view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver Padel and Tim Clarkson. Clarkson, for example, makes the point that the reference in Gweith Gwen Ystrat is to the men of Catraeth it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth, and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus, not Rhun, who baptized the Deirans. The first known translation of Y Gododdin was by Evan Evans Ieuan Fardd who printed ten stanzas with a Latin translation in his book Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh Bards published in 1764. The full text was printed for the first time by Owen Jones in the Myvyrian Archaiology in 1801. English translations of the poem were published by William Probert in 1820 and by John Williams Ab Ithel in 1852, followed by translations by William Forbes Skene in his Four Ancient Books of Wales 1866 and by Thomas Stephens for the Cymmrodorion Society in 1888. Gwenogvryn Evans produced a facsimile copy of the Book of Aneirin in 1908 and an edition with a translation in 1922. The first reliable edition was Canu Aneirin by Ifor Williams with notes in Welsh, published in 1938. New translations based on this work were published by Kenneth H. Jackson in 1969 and, with modernized Welsh text and glossary, by A.O.H. Jarman in 1988. A colour facsimile edition of the manuscript with an introduction by Daniel Huws was published by South Glamorgan County Council and the National Library of Wales in 1989. John Koch's new edition, which aimed to recreate the original text, appeared in 1997. There have also been a number of translations which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry 1970 and Steve Short's 1994 translation. There are a number of references to Y Gododdin in later Medieval Welsh poetry. The well known 12th century poem Hirlas Owain by Owain Cyfeiliog, in which Owain praises his own war band, likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses Y Gododdin as a model. A slightly later poet, Dafydd Benfras, in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great, wishes to be inspired to sing as Aneirin sang The day he sang the Gododdin . After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans Ieuan Fardd discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century. From the early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in Welsh poetry. In English, Y Gododdin was a major influence on the long poem In Parenthesis 1937 by David Jones, in which he reflects on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin at the beginning of each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much admired poem For the Fallen 1997 , written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheerss Pink Mist 2012 , an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play. The poem has also inspired a number of historical novels, including Men Went to Cattraeth 1969 by John James, The Shining Company 1990 by Rosemary Sutcliff and The Amber Treasure 2009 by Richard J Denning. In 1989 the British industrial band Test Dept brought out an album entitled Gododdin, in which the words of the poem were set to music, part in the original and part in English translation. This was a collaboration with the Welsh avant garde theatre company Brith Gof and was performed in Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Scotland.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%20Gododdin
"Coordinates 118N 10348E 1.3N 103.8E 1.3 103.8 Ya Kun Kaya Toast Simplified Chinese is a Singaporean chain of mass market, retro ambience cafes selling toast products notably kaya toast , soft boiled eggs and coffee. Founded by Loi Ah Koon in 1944, Ya Kun remained a small family run stall for decades, but have expanded rapidly since Loi's youngest son headed the business in 1999. They have over fifty outlets, mostly franchised, across six countries, and are a Singaporean cultural icon, known for their traditional brand identity and conservative, people centric corporate culture. In 1926, Lai Ah Koon emigrated from Hainan to Singapore, where he worked as a coffee stall assistant. He later went on to start his own business with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin , the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall. Ya Kun Coffeestall moved to Lau Pa Sat in 1972, but high rents and renovation of Lau Pa Sat in 1984 sparked a return to the Telok Ayer Market nevertheless, the stall continued to attract customers who came every day, some from as far as Jurong or Woodlands . In 1998, the market closed down, so the stall relocated to Far East Square and was renamed Ya Kun Kaya Toast the following year, Ah Koon died and his youngest son, Loi Boon Sim Adrin , took over the business, determined to keep his father's legacy going . Realising that Ya Kun had a lot of goodwill and potential, Adrin decided to expand the business, the family opened a second store at Tanjong Pagar and, in 2000, began franchising the brand. Ya Kun were incorporated in 2001, and they launched their first overseas outlet in Indonesia in 2002 and expanded their menu adding ice cream toast and the Toastwich , they have won the 2004 and 2005 Superbrands Award, the 2005 to 2007 SIFST Product Award and the 2008 SPBA CitiBusiness Regional Brands Award. Ya Kun Kaya Toast have over forty Singaporean outlets, about half of which are franchised, and over thirty overseas outlets, all franchised, across seven countries China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches their Asian alternative to sandwiches set meals combine any type of toast with soft boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik. Prices at local Ya Kun stores are slightly higher than those at kopitiams, but lower than prices of comparable products at Western coffeehouse chains operating in Singapore, while food at overseas Ya Kun outlets is relatively expensive. All outlets obtain their ingredients from the same suppliers and some ingredients, notably the kaya and coffee powder, are made at the Ya Kun factory in Bedok, using recipes that only a few of the Loi family know. The chain are widely regarded as an institution of good kaya toast and a Singaporean cultural icon that the Singapore Tourism Board has promoted as a tourist attraction. A Ming Pao review praised the crispy but not hard, fragrant but not burnt toast and fresh kaya, while a Straits Times review described the toast as evenly sliced and of the right texture , the eggs as cooked to perfection and the teh tarik as not too milky and not overpoweringly sweet either . Adrin has an 80 percent share of Ya Kun Singapore and his younger brother, Algie, has a 20 percent share, with other members of the Loi family actively involved in daily activities, while Ya Kun International is fully owned by Adrin Loi. Their corporate culture is conservative and people centric, with emphasis on preserving their brand identity as their chengnuo , commitment or promise to their customers, sustainable growth over actively pursuing new opportunities, nurturing family like relationships among staff they do not fire or retrench workers and avoiding aggressive conflict with competitors. Although Ya Kun do not publicly disclose their financial figures, a 2009 Lianhe Zaobao article estimated that the company had an annual revenue of S 8 million, while a 2012 article in The Star stated they had 300 employees.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%20Kun%20Kaya%20Toast
"Yad Kennedy Hebrew , Kennedy Memorial , located in the Mateh Yehuda Region near Jerusalem, Israel, is a memorial to John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, who was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963. The 60 foot high 18 m memorial is shaped like the stump of a felled tree, symbolizing a life cut short. Inside is a bronze relief of Kennedy, with an eternal flame burning in the center. It is encircled by 51 concrete columns, one for each of the 50 states in the United States plus one for Washington, D.C., that nation's capital. The emblems of the states and of the District of Columbia are displayed on each of the columns, and the columns are separated by slim panels of glass. The monument measures approximately 250 feet 76 m in circumference around its base, and there is space within the memorial for approximately 100 visitors at a time. The monument was built in 1966 with funds donated by American Jewish communities. Yad Kennedy and its adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. The Hebrew word yad, which is used for a number of memorials in Israel including the well known Holocaust memorial museum Yad Vashem , comes from the Book of Isaiah, chapter 56, verse 5 And to them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name yad vashem . The site is located 7 miles 11 km from downtown Jerusalem, in the same general direction as Hadassah Medical Center, on top of the highest of the Jerusalem hills, at an elevation of 825 metres 2,707 ft . The site overlooks what was at the time of the dedication the Jordanian village of Bittar now a part of Israel's West Bank , the historic site of Betar, famous as the last stronghold of the Jewish revolt led by Simon Bar Kochba against Roman forces in 132135 CE. The view from the parking lot has been described in the Frommer's travel guide as breathtaking a never ending succession of mountains and valleys. On a clear day, the Mediterranean Sea can be seen in the direction of Tel Aviv, 40 miles 64 km away. The memorial can be reached by following the winding mountain roads past Ora and Aminadav. It is approximately 45 minutes by foot from the nearest main road, where the closest Jerusalem city bus is 20, although special tour buses are normally utilized for group visits. The monument and adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. The area designated as the JFK Peace Forest is part of the larger Aminadav Forest , a 7,000 dunam forest in Ein Kerem. Max Bressler of Chicago, Illinois, then president of the American Jewish National Fund, came up with the proposal for the memorial in 1964. Bressler, for whom the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem is named, had hoped to lead an American delegation to the dedication ceremony, but he died in 1966. On 13 January 1964, former Pennsylvania Governor George M. Leader announced plans for the memorial, stating that he would serve as the General Chair of a State committee to raise funds. He stated that similar committees would be set up in each State, as well as some additional committees in countries overseas. On 22 November 1964, the first anniversary of the assassination, the Jewish National Fund sponsored meetings in major Jewish communities throughout the United States. The meetings were described as tributes for the fallen President as well as symbolic dedication ceremonies for the planned memorial. American communities pledged to fund the planting of trees in the forest in addition to funds for the memorial. For example, in July 1965, the community of Los Angeles, California pledged to have 100,000 trees planted as a result of a banquet sponsored by JNF attended by more than 1000 government, union, and management leaders. Nearly 2000 people, including many official guests representing the Israeli and United States governments, came to witness the dedication, along with hundreds of tourists, American students, and Israelis. An Israeli children's band played Hatikva, the Israeli national anthem, along with the U.S. anthem, the Star Spangled Banner. The New York Times reported that the children tried valiantly to play the U.S. song, playing very slowly, but then many strong voices from among the crowd helped out until the music swept the audience. Among the guests at the 4 July 1966 dedication was U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who had chaired the commission tasked with investigating the 1963 assassination. Among other guests were Levi Eshkol, Prime Minister of Israel, Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem, and Walworth Barbour, the United States Ambassador to Israel. Chief Justice Warren, who was reported to be so enthusiastic about the memorial after actually seeing it for the first time that he rewrote his remarks, noted We choose to do this on the American Independence Day but also in honor of the independence of Israel and other free nations. We are all confronted here by history because this is the birthplace of the world's three religions on which our own civilization is based and which contributed the all important principle that all people are God's children and entitled to live in peace. Warren noted that Washington, D.C. had many memorials, but that this area, with the forest as a living memorial, would have greatly pleased Kennedy for two reasons. First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the importance of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument . Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 of the differences between the people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit . Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used Shalom. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol spoke as well, noting that Kennedy's memory would be kept alive by this memorial not only as a friend of Israel but also as a symbol of the lofty ideals of his country and of all humanity, dedicating the memorial to the man who opened new frontiers of international relations and human friendships. In remarks offered by the American ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, he noted that A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors. In thus honoring and remembering the late President Kennedy, the men and women of the Jewish National Fund honor themselves beyond and above the glory they have already earned in their work for Israel. Jacob Tsur, world president of the Jewish National Fund, praised the memorial as well, conceived in the shape of a mighty trunk of a fallen tree, among the thousands of saplings which will grow one day into a great forest. Yad Kennedy was designed by the Brazilian born Israeli architect David Resnick, who later won the 1995 Israel Prize in architecture, and the Ukrainian born Israeli sculptor Dov Feigin. Feigin created the bust of Kennedy along with a memorial wall that includes excerpts from a number of Kennedy's speeches. Resnick said that the entire complex is intended to symbolize the vigor of a great man whose life was tragically ended in mid growth by assassination . Resnick was awarded the contract to design the memorial after a nationwide competition. His initial vision for the memorial was a free form but generally circular shape, set within a reflecting pool. However, because money was being raised for the memorial by groups in all 50 states in the U.S., as well as groups in Washington, D.C., a vision of columns for each of those locations ultimately helped him come up with the concept of a tree trunk, linked to the idea that Kennedy's life had been cut down like a tree that is felled in its prime. The courtyard below the memorial includes a number of plaques acknowledging contributions by individuals and groups. In addition to the Kennedy relief and eternal flame, papers and photographs relating to the subject of Israel United States relations until the time of Kennedy's assassination are kept in a small library. In 1974, a picnic site was added on the grounds of the memorial, open to visitors. The JNF announced that the site would include rustic benches and tables, water facilities and shaded eating areas, and would be close to the impressive stone and metal memorialbut far enough away not to pollute the area. The Kennedy Peace Forest was dedicated before the memorial, with official dedication ceremonies taking place on 22 November 1964, on the first anniversary of Kennedy's assassination. In June 1966 Jewish National Fund officials announced that 1.5 million trees had already been planted in the forest in preparation for the memorial's planned 4 July dedication ceremonies. The announcement noted that another 2 million trees had been planted in the adjoining United States Freedom Forest, with a goal of planting 5.5 million trees in the two forests, as a number equal to the Jewish population of the United States. More than three million dollars in donations had been received at that point for the Kennedy Forest, from more than 100,000 donors. In June 1968, the JNF announced it would plant 500,000 trees in the Kennedy Forest in memory of John F. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated on 6 June of that year. In 1999, JNF announced that trees would also be planted in memory of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister in law Lauren Bessette, all victims of a 16 July 1999 plane crash in the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. In April 1989 a forest fire possibly the result of arson destroyed approximately 8 acres 3.2 ha and 3000 trees in the forest. Among the many special events that have taken place at the memorial was a visit by a number of officers and crew members from the United States aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy CV67 , named in honor of the same U.S. President memorialized by this monument, during a 1997 port visit to Haifa. A VIP Kennedy Memorial tree planting center is included on the grounds of the memorial, where many distinguished visitors from other countries have planted trees. In May 1978 Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of the president, visited the memorial and planted a tree in the forest. Other members of the Kennedy family who have visited the memorial and planted trees include U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy JFK's brother , on 11 December 1986 Joan Kennedy Teddy Kennedy's first wife , on 24 January 1983 and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and his sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend JFK's nephew and niece children of Robert F. Kennedy , on 1 January 1987. A special Kennedy Family Planting Circle was established by the Jewish National Fund. In 2001 Kennedy's daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, then Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, visited Yad Kennedy during her tour of Israel with her husband and three of her four daughters. Visiting American military personnel are among those who plant trees at the memorial because of its remembrance of an American president. Among those who have planted trees at the site are former Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force. Israeli groups also take part in the tree planting tradition, especially on the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, an occasion linked to trees. On some occasions as many as 4000 Israeli school children have come to the Kennedy Peace Forest to plant trees on that holiday. In addition to individual or group tree plantings, there have been special occasions when smaller forests have been dedicated within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest. For example, as early as January 1966, even before the dedication of the memorial, a forest was planted in honor of Ambassador Avraham Harman, Israel's ambassador to the United States. The Avraham Harman Forest was contributed by Bnai Zion, a pro Israel fraternal group in the U.S., and Golda Meir, newly retired from her post as Israel's Prime Minister, was one of the participants in the dedication ceremony. Other specially designated areas within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest include a woodland set up to memorialize the victims of the 1972 Lydda airport now named Ben Gurion International Airport terrorist attack.

"Typhoon Yagi was an intense typhoon, the strongest of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, which reached the equivalence of Category 5 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forming out of a tropical depression on September 16, Yagi quickly strengthened as it executed a slow clockwise loop over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On September 19, Yagi strengthened into a typhoon as a subtropical ridge steered the storm towards the west. Two days later, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 195 km h 120 mph 10 minute winds with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa mbar . The typhoon gradually weakened as it recurved towards the northeast and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on September 24 and became extratropical the next day. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands on September 27. The typhoon caused severe damage on the island of Chichijima but no injuries were reported as a result of the storm. On September 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA began monitoring an area of convection as a tropical depression about 1,270 km 790 mi east northeast of Guam. The depression was located within an area of low to moderate wind shear under an upper level anticyclone. Flaring convection was noted along the eastern portion of the developing system before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert later that day. Early on September 17, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 16W. Located within a weak steering environment, the storm executed a clockwise loop while quickly strengthening. Several hours after the JTWC issued their first advisory, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Yagi the name was contributed by Japan, and is the Japanese word for goat . Late on September 18, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC classified the storm as a minimal typhoon. Early on September 19, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a typhoon. After completing the loop, Yagi's track was influenced by a subtropical ridge located to the southeast of Japan. The typhoon continued to intensify and reached its peak intensity on September 21 with winds of 195 km h 120 mph 10 minute winds with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa mbar , making it the strongest storm of the season according to the JMA. At the same time, the JTWC classified Yagi as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260 km h 160 mph 1 minute winds . On September 22, Yagi passed by the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichijima as the storm recurved towards the northeast. With increasing wind shear, the typhoon began to weaken and also began to undergo an extratropical transition. Late on September 24, the JTWC classified the storm as an extratropical cyclone and issued their final advisory. The JMA kept Yagi as a tropical system for another day as it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Early on September 25, they classified it as extratropical. The remnants of Yagi continued towards the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on September 27. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands. On September 23, Typhoon Yagi passed directly over the resort island of Chichijima which has a population of about 2,000. The cyclone brought winds up to 210 km h 130 mph , making it the strongest typhoon in 20 years to hit the island. About 1,000 of the 1,270 homes were without power during the height of the storm. About 150 residents evacuated to local shelters during the storm to escape the high winds and heavy rains. At least one structure was destroyed and numerous others sustained damage. The storm reportedly produced torrential rains, but there are no known measurements. Several homes had their roofs blown off and windows broken. Street lamps were knocked down by the strong winds produced by Yagi. Ferry service for several ports was cancelled for 29 days following the typhoon. Fallen trees knocked down power lines and cut communications. Some homes were reported to have lost water pressure also. The storm passed close to Iwo Jima on September 22, with the island being within the range of 95 km h 60 mph winds. No loss of life or injuries were related to Typhoon Yagi.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon%20Yagi%20%282006%29
"Yakov and the Seven Thieves is a picture book written by American entertainer Madonna. It was released on June 21, 2004, by Callaway Arts Entertainment in over 110 countries and 38 different languages, including a Braille edition. The book contains a moral tale and was inspired by a 300 year old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov, that Madonna had heard from her Kabbalah teacher. The premise was set in a small, 18th century town in Eastern Europe, and the story talks about how everyone has the ability to open the gates of heaven, however unworthy one is deemed to be. The cover art and the images inside were painted by Russian illustrator Gennady Spirin who chose Baroque painting as inspiration for crafting the characters and the scenery. Like her previous endeavors, Madonna promoted the release by appearing on talk show and reading to children at a hospital in London. Critics gave mixed review of the book, with reviews being mostly negative about Madonna's writing but praised Spirin's illustrations. Three weeks after its release, Yakov and the Seven Thieves debuted at number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list in the category for Children's Picture books. A cobbler called Yakov and his wife Olga are frightened that their gravely ill son Mikhhail is dying. They hear about a man of healing who lives in the last house of their village and Yakov goes to him for guidance. The man refuses Yakov's money, instead clarifies that if he can save Yakov's son, the cobbler can repay by making a pair of shoes for his grandson. The next day, Yakov visited the man only to be told that when he had prayed, the gates of heaven would not open. The distressed cobbler begged him to try yet one more time. The healer asked his grandson to go into the village and find all the thieves, pickpockets and criminals, and bring them back to the house. They included the thieves Vladimir the Villain who could bend metal and punch holes through stones, Boris the Barefoot Midget who snatched the purse of old ladies, Ivan the Arsonist, Petra the Pickpocket, Stinky Pasha and a large host of ne'er do wells. With the healer's direction, the thieves all got on their knees and started to pray. A miracle occurred and the prayers of the men, who previously robbed by opening gates, helped to open the gates of heaven and Yakov's son was healed. The next day, Yakov came with a new pair of shoes for the grandson and declared that Mikhail was alive and well. It was the prayers of the gang of crooks that made a difference. In 2003, American singer Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences . The first two releases were The English Roses September 2003 , and Mr. Peabody's Apples November 2003 . Both debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. Joe D'Angelo from MTV News confirmed that the third book would be titled Yakov and the Seven Thieves. Madonna was again inspired by a 300 year old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov that she had heard from her Kabbalah teacher, and wanted to share the essence of it. We must never forget that hidden behind a large amount of darkness is a large amount of light, the singer wrote in the preface. According to the press release, the premise was set in a small, 18th century town in Eastern Europe and was written for readers aged six and up, with the book manufactured in a 32 page jacketed hardcover. The initial release date for Yakov and the Seven Thieves was set for April 2004, but publisher Nicholas Callaway confirmed that the book would be released on June 21, 2004, in over 110 countries and 38 different languages, including a Braille edition. Although Callaway published it, the release was distributed through 42 agencies, including Gallimard Jeunesse in France, Penguin Books in the United Kingdom and the United States, and Hanser Verlag in Germany. Madonna promoted the book by appearing on ABC News on June 16, 2004, where she dedicated the release to naughty children everywhere and spoke about the power of praying according to her. While on the Re Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna visited London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, where her daughter Lourdes read an excerpt from the book to a group of ailing children. The cover art and the images inside were painted by Russian illustrator Gennady Spirin. This was Spirin's first time working with a contemporary author and story, and was initially uncomfortable with the mayhem surrounding Madonna. He clarified that the ideas given to him were clear and style parameters were set , which resulted in crafting the characters amazingly quickly . Since the story was set in 18th century Europe, Spirin chose Baroque painting as inspiration since it made the book dressier, but at the same time preserves the dramatic element and the psychological characteristics of each of the characters . Three weeks after its release, Yakov and the Seven Thieves debuted at number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list in the category for Children's Picture books. The sales fell drastically, as observed by Edward Wyatt from The New York Times, and it sold just 27,000 copies according to Nielsen BookScan. This was much less from the 321,000 copies sold of The English Roses and the 127,000 copies of Mr. Peabody's Apples. Positive review came from The Des Moines Register with critic Maria Sudekum Fisher complimenting the redemption arc of the storyline. The Children's BBC did not find any weak bits in the book and listed the introduction of the thieves as well as the illustrations as highlight. Canada.com found Yakov to be the best among Madonna's three released books, feeling that the story moves along nicely and gets its message about redemption across without being too preachy. it's also appropriately written for its target audience . An article in The Economist felt that had any unknown author released Yakov and the Seven Thieves, it would not have received much promotion. The review noted that the message in the story was distinct, describing it as a more overtly religious message than is normally encountered in children's picture books and found the moral as purely medieval Catholicism . The critic added that for all the ecumenical confusion, the message is heartfelt and the delivery straightforward. has a vivid and direct writing stylepresumably the product of two decades of song writing experience. The Publishers Weekly complimented Spirin's illustrations and Madonna's comic writing while describing the seven thieves, but criticized her soapbox approach in telling a witty story. The review also noted Spirin adding minute details to the images, including the smallest features of 18th century European town life cobbler's nails, brass drawer pulls, feather pens, children's toys . Deirdre Donahue from USA Today also complimented Spirin's paintings, but was critical of the story, calling it dreary and inappropriate as well as lackluster and verbose . She criticized the fact that Spirin's name was not present on the book cover art and felt that Yakov and the Seven Thieves was the worst of Madonna's three published children's books. Dying children, prayers, criminals praying to open the gates of heaven. It's positively Grimm. Yakov will either bore or frighten children, Donahue concluded. Tim Adams from The Observer compared the release to the work of Hans Christian Andersen, but added that the triteness of the story and the easiness of the moralising is more than redeemed by the excellence of the illustrations . Reviewing the book for Tablet, Ayelet Waldman found the moral of the story as unsatisfying and somehow ill constructed , as well as half baked . She complimented Spirin's paintings describing them as complex and multilayered like Renaissance paintings, but found it odd that the renderings were not Jewish, and instead the illustrator gave a Tudor town. Waldman believed that Yakov and the Seven Thieves would become a staple of Hanukkah gift giving. It's a muddled and simplistic story ... but the illustrations are lovely and the title sounds like those of all the other boring Jewish storybooks. Jane Doonan from Times Educational Supplement listed the artwork as the best reason for buying the book, since she felt that the internal logic of the story doesn't bear inspection, and the mawkishness and moralising is unappealing .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov%20and%20the%20Seven%20Thieves
"The Yakovlev Yak 15 Russian 15 NATO reporting name Feather, USAF DOD designation Type 2 was a first generation Soviet turbojet fighter developed by the Yakovlev design bureau OKB immediately after World War II. It used a reverse engineered German Junkers Jumo 004 engine. Along with the Swedish Saab 21R, it was one of only two jets to be successfully converted from a piston powered aircraft and enter production. 280 aircraft were built in 1947. Although nominally a fighter, it was mainly used to qualify piston engine experienced pilots to fly jets. On 9 April 1945, the Council of People's Commissars ordered the Yakovlev OKB to develop a single seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single German Jumo 004 engine. To save time, Yakovlev based the new design known as the Yak 3 Jumo or Yak Jumo on the latest version of his successful Yakovlev Yak 3 piston engined fighter. The piston engine was removed and the jet engine was mounted underneath the forward fuselage so that its exhaust exited underneath the middle of the fuselage. To protect the fuselage, a steel heatshield was added to its bottom. The deeper forward part of the fuselage gave the aircraft a pod and boom configuration. Very few changes were made to the metal fuselage other than at the aircraft's nose. This was recontoured to accommodate the armament of two 23 millimeter 0.91 in Nudelman Suranov NS 23 autocannon, an additional fuel tank above the engine and the engine itself. No changes were made to the wings other than the elimination of the air intakes for the oil cooler and the bending of the front wing spar into an inverted U shape to clear the engine. The vertical stabilizer was slightly enlarged, but the tailplane was unmodified. The conventional landing gear was also unmodified other than the tailwheel which now used several steel leaf springs as shock absorbers. The Yak Jumo carried a total of 590 kilograms 1,300 lb of fuel. Taxi tests began in October 1945, but the heatshield proved to be too short and the heat from the engine exhaust melted the duralumin skin of the rear fuselage as well as the rubber tire of the tailwheel. Modifications to rectify the problems took until late December. By this time a second prototype had been completed with a solid steel tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane. After a few taxiing tests, it was transferred to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute TsAGI for full scale windtunnel testing that lasted until February 1946. On the 26th of that month, the Council of People's Commissars issued requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of 770 km h 480 mph at sea level and a speed of 850 km h 530 mph at an altitude of 5,000 meters 16,400 ft . It should be able to climb to that altitude in 4 1 2 minutes or less and it should have a range of 500 kilometers 310 mi at 90 of maximum speed. Two prototypes were to be ready for flight testing on 1 September. According to aviation historians Bill Gunston and Yefim Gordon, representatives from Yakovlev and the Mikoyan Gurevich OKB tossed a coin on 24 April 1946 to determine which aircraft would be the first Soviet jet to fly. Yakovlev lost and the Yak Jumo made one circuit of the airfield before landing. The manufacturer's flight testing of the aircraft was completed on 22 June, but its early success caused the Council of Ministers to issue a new requirement on 29 April for two aircraft powered by the Soviet built RD 10 engine known as the Yak 15, Yak 15RD10 or Yak RD . Aside from the new engine, the requirement differed from the previous one only in a range of 700 kilometers 430 mi at optimum cruise speed and a reduction of the maximum ceiling to 14,000 meters 45,930 ft . Two prototypes were ordered to be available for flight testing on 1 September 1946. Yakovlev was able to adapt the two existing prototypes to the RD 10 with little trouble and one aircraft participated in the August 1946 Tushino flypast. The day after the aerial display, Joseph Stalin summoned Artem Mikoyan and Aleksandr Yakovlev to his office and ordered that each OKB build 15 aircraft to participate in the 7 November parade in Red Square commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. Factory No. 31 in Tbilisi was chosen to build the new aircraft because it was still building conventional Yak 3s and could easily switch to the jet fighter. All 15 aircraft were built before the deadline, although they lacked any armour, were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament, and had an incomplete avionics outfit. The parade was canceled and two of the aircraft were modified with a single 23 mm cannon and began State acceptance trials which lasted until April 1947. The tests revealed a number of problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak 3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak 15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer. Even before the State acceptance trials were completed, the Council of Ministers ordered the aircraft into production in December 1946. 50 aircraft were to be built between January and April 1947, equally split between single seat aircraft and two seat trainers, armed with only a single cannon. The trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single seaters. Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947. A total of 280 Yak 15s were produced through the end of the year, exclusive of prototypes. The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers. The aircraft's manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout the late 1940s. A single prototype of the two seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 in the fall of 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak 21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak 15V, Yak 15UT or Yak 21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak 17 with its tricycle undercarriage. One Yak 15 was used to test a prototype aerial refueling system in 1949, although the installation on the fighter and the Tupolev Tu 2 bomber used as the tanker were both dummies to test procedures and fit. On 29 April 1946, five days after the Mikoyan Gurevich I 300 and the Yak Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new aircraft similar to the Yak Jumo, using the RD 10 engine with improved aerodynamics. This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted. The back of the seat was armoured and the pilot was also protected by a bulletproof windscreen. The entire canopy was also redesigned to accommodate the new windscreen. The landing gear could not be housed in the thin wings so it was redesigned to retract into the fuselage. Low and high wing loading wing versions were considered, but the low wing loading 15 square meter 160 sq ft wings were chosen for the prototype. At an altitude of 5000 meters, the Yak 17 RD10, as the new fighter was designated, was expected to have a top speed of 822 km h 511 mph a significant improvement over that of the production Yak 15. The aircraft was completed on 3 September and ground tests lasted until 26 September, but it never flew as the Yak 15 had already been ordered into production and its conventional landing gear was already deemed obsolete. There is only a replica of the 'Yellow 37' at the Vadim Zadorozhny Technical Museum, outside Moscow.

"The Yakovlev Yak 19 Russian 19, USAF DOD designation Type 7 was a prototype Soviet fighter built in late 1940s. It was the first Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburning turbojet, the Klimov RD 10F that was derived from the German Jumo 004 engine. Only two examples were built as it was rejected for service by the Soviet Air Force. In April 1946, the Council of People's Commissars ordered several design bureaux OKB Russian Opytnoye Konstruktorskoye Buro , included that of Alexander Yakovlev, to develop a single seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single Lyulka TR 1 turbojet engine. The aircraft should have a maximum speed of 850 kilometers per hour 528 mph at sea level and a speed of 900 km h 559 mph at an altitude of 5,000 meters 16,400 ft . It should be able to climb to that altitude in 3.8 minutes or less and should have a maximum range of no less than 700 kilometers 430 mi . Yakovlev and his team were well aware that any derivative of their earlier Yak 15 and Yak 17 fighters, then under development, could not reach the required speed because of their thick wings and chose to begin a clean slate design. Preliminary work used the same pod and boom layout as had been used in the earlier Yakovlev designs, although the cockpit was located in front of the engine. The TR 1 engine was plagued by delays and Yakovlev devoted most of his efforts to designs that used the RD 10. By late June, Yakovlev had decided to use a more aerodynamically efficient tubular layout with the engine buried in the center of the fuselage. After it became clear that neither the TR 1, nor the imported British Rolls Royce Nene or Rolls Royce Derwent engines would be available to power the prototypes, Yakovlev settled on the newly available afterburning version of the RD 10. The first prototype was ordered to a very demanding schedule and was completed on 29 November 1946. The Yak 19 had an flattened oval shaped, metal semi monocoque fuselage with the single seat cockpit and its teardrop shaped canopy positioned just forward of the 1,100 kgf 11 kN 2,400 lbf axial flow RD 10F turbojet engine. Its air intake was in the nose and the afterburner was positioned at the rear of the fuselage, just below the tail structure. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar flow, two spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons. The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers the upper portion was fabric covered while the lower half was metal skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak 19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of 650 kilograms 1,430 lb of fuel. It was armed with two 23 millimeter 0.9 in Nudelman Suranov NS 23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds. The day after the first prototype was completed, it was trucked to Khodynka Field to begin taxiing trials. On 12 December it caught fire when a defective fuel gasket blew out the repairs took a fortnight. Immediately before its maiden flight, a pair of experimental 23 mm Shpitalny Sh 3 autocannon replaced the NS 23s. It first flew on 8 January 1947 with Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Ivanov, at the controls, although he was not the primary test pilot. The Yak 19 was grounded from 2 March to 18 May as it awaited a new engine. On 21 May, the afterburner was tested in flight for the first time. While the fighter was the first Soviet aircraft to be equipped with an afterburner, it was not the first one to use one in flight as the Aircraft 156 had done so over a month earlier. The second prototype first flew on 6 June and was almost identical with the first prototype. Changes included five degrees of dihedral to the horizontal stabilizer, a slightly revised vertical stabilizer and plumbing for a pair of 195 liter 43 imp gal 52 U.S. gal drop tanks underneath the wingtips. This increased the fighter's total fuel load to 980 kilograms 2,160 lb . During the manufacturer's flight tests, the Yak 19 became the first Soviet aircraft to exceed 900 km h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before the testing was completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August. State acceptance tests began on 17 October, using the second prototype, and finished on 30 January 1948. The group of military test pilots concluded that the afterburner was unreliable and the aircraft was difficult to control in roll. Other complaints were focused on the cockpit it was deemed was too small and lacked sufficient armor and heating or ventilation. They decided that the Yak 19 could not be recommended for service. Rather than modify the aircraft to address these problems, Yakovlev chose to cancel it entirely in favor of designs using the more powerful 1,500 kgf 15 kN 3,300 lbf Rolls Royce Derwent derived Klimov RD 500, like his Yak 23 and Yak 25 fighters then under development.

"Yakumo , Eight Clouds was an armored cruiser built for the Imperial Japanese Navy IJN in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was built in Germany. She participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo Japanese War of 190405, and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. Yakumo saw no combat during World War I and began the first of many training cruises in 1917, although she was not officially reclassified as a training ship until 1931. Her last training cruise was in 1939, but the ship continued to conduct training in home waters throughout the Pacific War. Yakumo became a repatriation transport after the war and was broken up in 194647. The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino Japanese War, and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships, all of which had to be ordered from overseas shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships, and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships, believing that the recent introduction of tougher Krupp cemented armor would allow them to stand in the line of battle. The revised plan is commonly known as the Six Six Fleet . The first four ships were built by Armstrong Whitworth in the United Kingdom, but the last two ships were built in Germany and France. To ensure ammunition compatibility, the IJN required their builders to use the same British guns as the other four ships. In general, the IJN provided only a sketch design and specifications that each builder had to comply with otherwise each builder was free to build the ships as they saw fit. Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Yakumo and her half sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline. The ship was 132.3 meters 434 ft 1 in long overall and 124.64 meters 408 ft 11 in between perpendiculars. She had a beam of 19.57 meters 64 ft 2 in and had an average draft of 7.21 meters 23 ft 8 in . Yakumo displaced 9,646 metric tons 9,494 long tons at normal load and 10,288 metric tons 10,126 long tons at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of 0.95 meters 3 ft 1 in . She had a double bottom and her hull was subdivided into 247 watertight compartments. Her crew consisted of 670 officers and enlisted men. Yakumo had two 4 cylinder triple expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of 15,500 indicated horsepower 11,600 kW . The ship had a designed speed of 20 knots 37 km h 23 mph and reached 21.005 knots 38.901 km h 24.172 mph during her sea trials from 16,960 ihp 12,650 kW . She carried up to 1,300 metric tons 1,300 long tons 1,400 short tons of coal and could steam for 7,000 nautical miles 13,000 km 8,100 mi at a speed of 10 knots 19 km h 12 mph . The main armament for all of the Six Six Fleet armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth built 45 caliber eight inch guns in twin gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130 rotation left and right, and the guns could be elevated to 30 and depressed to 5. The turret accommodated 65 shells, but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship's deck that allowed the electric winch in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull. The ship carried a total of 320 eight inch shells. The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1.2 rounds per minute. The 203 millimeter gun fired 113.5 kilogram 250 lb armor piercing AP projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 760 meters per second 2,500 ft s to a range of 18,000 meters 20,000 yd . The secondary armament consisted of a dozen Elswick Ordnance Company Pattern Z quick firing QF , 40 caliber, 6 inch guns. Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks, and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Their 45.4 kilograms 100 lb AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 700 meters per second 2,300 ft s . The guns were provided with 150 rounds each. Yakumo was also equipped with a dozen 40 caliber QF 12 pounder 12 cwt guns and eight QF 2.5 pounder Yamauchi guns as close range defense against torpedo boats. The former gun fired 76 millimeter 3 in , 5.7 kilogram 12.5 lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 719 meters per second 2,359 ft s . Yakumo was equipped with five 457 mm 18.0 in torpedo tubes, one above water in the bow and four submerged tubes, two on each broadside. The Type 30 torpedo had a 100 kilogram 220 lb warhead and three range speed settings 800 meters 870 yd at 27 knots 50 km h 31 mph , 1,000 meters 1,100 yd at 23.6 knots 43.7 km h 27.2 mph or 3,000 meters 3,300 yd at 14.2 knots 26.3 km h 16.3 mph . All of the Six Six Fleet armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor. The waterline belt ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from 178 millimeters 7.0 in amidships to 89 millimeters 3.5 in at the bow and stern. It had a height of 2.13 meters 7 ft 0 in , of which 1.49 meters 4 ft 11 in was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was 127 millimeters 5.0 in thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended 61.49 meters 201 ft 9 in from the forward to the rear barbette. Yakumo had only a single transverse 127 mm armored bulkhead that closed off the forward end of the central armored citadel. The barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 152 millimeters thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by 51 millimeters 2.0 in of armor. The deck was 63 millimeters 2.5 in thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was 356 millimeters 14.0 in in thickness. Yakumo, named from a stanza of the waka poem by Susanoo in the Japanese mythology, was ordered on 1 September 1897 and laid down a year later by AG Vulcan Stettin in Stettin, Germany. The ship was launched on 8 July 1899 and completed on 20 June 1900. She departed Stettin two days later and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 30 August. At the start of the Russo Japanese War, Yakumo was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Togo Heihachiro led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Togo had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Togo chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight and six inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Togo disengaged. Yakumo was not hit during the engagement, although she did hit the protected cruiser Novik one time with an eight inch shell. In early March, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Yakumo was then transferred to Rear Admiral Dewa Shigeto's 3rd Division. On 23 June, the ship was Dewa's flagship when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle. On the morning of 10 August 1904, Dewa's cruisers were over 15 nautical miles 28 km 17 mi south of Togo's 1st Division when the Russians sortied from Port Arthur in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. In the early stages of the battle, Dewa attempted to engage the Russian cruisers trailing the battleships in accordance with Togo's standing orders, but was rebuffed by fire from the battleships. As Dewa closed with the Russians later in the afternoon in another attempt to attack the Russian cruisers, a 12 inch 305 mm shell struck Yakumo amidships at 15 40, killing 12 and wounding 11. The range at this time exceeded 8 nautical miles 15 km 9.2 mi , beyond the range of any gun in his squadron, so Dewa ordered his ships to disengage. By 17 45, Yakumo had maneuvered to about 8,000 or 9,000 meters 8,700 or 9,800 yd from the damaged Russian battleship Poltava and opened fire. Yakumo continued to close until the Russian squadron was thrown into confusion by the death of Vitgeft around 18 40. The 3rd Division then followed Togo's ships as they circled the Russian ships while they sorted themselves out, now firing at the Russian cruisers with little effect, until Togo ordered Dewa to attack the Russian destroyers at about 19 44. Dewa cancelled that last order and turned south around 20 00 in pursuit of several Russian cruisers that were fleeing to the south, in an attempt to intercept them before they reached the isolated flotillas of destroyers and torpedo boats. The Russian ships were engaged by other Japanese cruisers before they could reach the small ships, and Dewa broke off the pursuit around 20 25 as light was fading. He continued south eastwards overnight and spotted one cruiser and two destroyers, but was unable to catch any of them. On 14 August, Yakumo and the 3rd Division was ordered to Tsingtao to confirm that the Germans had indeed interned the battleship Tsesarevich and three destroyers that had taken shelter there after the battle. After their return, they were reassigned to the blockade of Port Arthur. In mid September, Yakumo was transferred back to Kamimura's 2nd Division, which was defending the Strait of Tsushima, although she began a refit at the end of the month. The ship returned to Dewa on 15 November and he transferred his flag back to her. On 13 December, the ship attempted to rescue survivors of the Takasago after she had struck a mine, but found no one still living. Yakumo was sent to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for another refit five days later. On 1 February 1905, the ship was ordered to join Rear Admiral Shimamura Hayao's 2nd Division blockading Vladivostok, although this only lasted for a few weeks as she was ordered to Kure Naval Arsenal for a final refit in mid February before the anticipated battle with the Russian ships sent from the Baltic Fleet. As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May, having sailed from the Baltic Sea, Yakumo was assigned to Kamimura's 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet. The Russians were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports were enough to cause Togo to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11 30. Kamimura closed to about a range of 8000 meters before sheering off under fire to join Togo's battleships. Yakumo was fourth of six when Togo opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14 10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship Oslyabya which was forced to fall out of formation at 14 50 and sank 20 minutes later. By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and the battleship Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15 35 at a range of about 2,000 meters 6,600 ft . All of Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes or so, with Yakumo and the armored cruiser Azuma also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect. After 17 30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers, leaving Togo's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18 03 and turned northwards to rejoin Togo. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18 30 and opened fire when the range closed to 80009000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians, and they ceased fire by 19 30 and rejoined Togo at 20 08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10 30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships, as he could neither return fire nor close the range. In the meantime, the coast defense ship Admiral Ushakov had fallen well behind Nebogatov's ships and was spotted by the protected cruiser Chiyoda early in the morning, but the Japanese were more intent on locating the main body of the Russian fleet than attacking a single isolated ship. Admiral Ushakov was then spotted at 14 10, well after Nebogatov's surrender, by Shimamura who received permission to pursue her with his flagship, the armored cruiser Iwate, and Yakumo. They caught up with the Russian ship at 17 00 and demanded her surrender. Admiral Ushakov attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns, but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship never hit either one. After about half an hour, Admiral Ushakov was listing heavily enough that her guns could not elevate enough to bear, and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the scuttling charges detonated. The ship sank in three minutes and 12 officers and 327 crewmen were rescued by the Japanese. Between them, Yakumo and Iwate fired 89 eight and 278 six inch shells during the engagement. Over the course of the entire battle, Yakumo was struck by a single twelve inch shell and six others, of which three or four were six inches in size. They inflicted only minor damage. On 14 June, Yakumo was assigned as the flagship of Vice Admiral Kataoka Shichiro, commander of the 3rd Fleet, as part of the operation to capture the island of Sakhalin in July. In November 1914, Yakumo was deployed to Singapore preparatory to searching for the German commerce raider Emden, but the ship was sunk before the mission began. Yakumo served as the flagship of Destroyer Squadron Suiraisentai 2 from 13 December 1915 to 1 December 1916 and then of Suiraisentai 1 from 1 to 12 December. In February 1917, the ship began patrolling the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, searching for German commerce raiders. She began the first of her many training cruises on 5 April when she departed for North America and Hawaii, before arriving back in Japan on 17 August. In October 1918, Kichisaburo Nomura was appointed captain of Yakumo for two months, only one of which he spent on board the vessel, as a political appointment to qualify Nomura for flag rank. On 1 September 1921, Yakumo was re designated as a 1st class coast defense ship and used primarily for training duties in long distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. In this capacity, she participated in 13 more voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to Europe, North and South America, and the South Pacific, including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922, in company with the armored cruiser Izumo. Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes Kuni Asaakira and Kacho Hirotada. In 1924, four of Yakumo's 12 pounder guns were removed, as were all of her QF 2.5 pounder guns, and a single 8 cm 40 3rd Year Type anti aircraft gun was added. In addition three of her torpedo tubes were removed. Three years later, her boilers were replaced by six Yarrow boilers, formerly from the battleship Haruna, which reduced her power to 7,000 ihp 5,200 kW and maximum speed to 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph . These boilers used a mix of coal and fuel oil, and the ship now carried a total of 1,210 metric tons 1,190 long tons of coal and 306 metric tons 301 long tons of oil. During a visit to Tsingtao in 1932, Yakumo and Izumo had to land marines on 13 January to quell a riot by Japanese residents there. The following year, the ship was reclassified as a training ship. On 6 November 1936, between the islands of Saipan and Truk, an accidental explosion in her front magazine killed four crewmen and flooded her front food locker. Repairs were made underway and Yakumo arrived home two weeks later. A month after her return, in December 1936, Captain Matome Ugaki assumed command of Yakumo until he took command of the battleship Hyuga the next year. Her last training cruise ended on 20 November 1939. After the start of the Pacific War, Yakumo was reclassified as a 1st class cruiser on 1 July 1942, and her eight inch guns were replaced by four 12.7 cm 5.0 in Type 89 dual purpose guns in two twin mounts. In addition her light anti aircraft armament was augmented. However, Yakumo remained within the confines of the Seto Inland Sea throughout the war as she was assigned to training duties, and was not used in any combat operations. She was stricken from the navy list on 1 October 1945. Yakumo began service as a repatriation transport on 7 December. Her mission was to return troops and civilians to the home islands from Japan's former overseas possessions, primarily from Taiwan and mainland China. She completed her last voyage in June 1946, repatriating a total of 9,010 people. Yakumo arrived at the Maizuru shipyard of Hitachi Shipbuilding Engineering on 20 July 1946 to begin demolition that lasted until 1 April 1947.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese%20cruiser%20Yakumo
"The Yale Union Laundry Building, also known as the Yale Laundry Building, the City Linen Supply Co. Building, Perfect Fit Manufacturing and simply Yale Union YU , in southeast Portland, Oregon, is a two story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built largely of brick in 1908, and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations, it was added to the register in 2007. Two story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an L shaped structure that shares a party wall with a building to the east. Preservation of elements of Portland's industrial laundry era, and its relation to the women's labor movement and the rise of the middle class in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union YU , a contemporary arts center. Located at 800 Southeast 10th Avenue, the building occupies the west half of the block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence is seen in the ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side. The original building's main floor has vaulted ceilings, large windows, brick walls, a flat roof, and wooden cross beams. The mezzanine consists of three rooms. The second floor has large windows and vaulted ceilings, restrooms, and a lunchroom. Stairs and elevators connect the levels, including the basement and its boiler room. A lobby and office in the southwest corner of the main floor can be entered from inside or via the original main door off Southeast 10th Avenue. Following purchase in 2008, renovations began to convert the building into a contemporary arts center. Architects designed gallery spaces, a bookstore and cafe, a 100 seat room, library and kitchen. Geothermal heating supplied by an aquifer underneath the building will contribute to the goal of LEED Platinum status. The Yale Union Laundry Building was built to house a commercial laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before the invention of the steam laundry machine in the mid 19th century, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible by the turn of the century. In 1908, Charles F. Brown, who entered the laundry business in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and the main part of the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women. Federal and state laws regulating hours, wages, and working conditions changed markedly in the United States during the early 20th century. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of 8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations and the rise of organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927. By 1931, more than 80 percent of the services offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people could no longer afford the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to a large percentage of the populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006. Since 2008, the building has housed Yale Union YU , a contemporary arts center. Alter LLC, associated with the Monfort Family Foundation, purchased the building for 3.5 million and intended to fund renovations and operations until the arts center generated revenue on its own. Renovations costing an additional 7.2 million, also funded by Alter, included a bookstore and cafe, and a 100 seat room. The center was officially unveiled in November 2010 with a renovated kitchen and additional improvements planned. More than 600 people attended YU's first public exhibit in May 2011.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale%20Union%20Laundry%20Building
"Yalla is a song recorded by Romanian singer Inna for her eponymous fourth studio album 2015 and its Japanese counterpart, Body and the Sun 2015 . It was released on 3 November 2015 through Empire and Roton. The recording was written by Marcel Botezan, Sebastian Barac, Nadir Tamuz Augustin and Inna, while production was handled by the first two under the name of Play Win. A dance pop and Eurodance track, Yalla is sung in both English and Arabic. Music critics were positive towards the song, commending its production and commercial appeal. An accompanying music video for Yalla which received notable airplay in Romania was shot by Barna Nemethi in Marrakesh, Morocco and premiered on YouTube on 12 November 2015. Featuring Inna chased by a man at a bazaar, it attracted multiple comments written in Arabic. To promote the single, Inna also had various concert venues. Commercially, Yalla peaked at number 13 in Romania and at number 18 on the Polish dance chart. Yalla was written by Marcel Botezan, Sebastian Barac, Nadir Tamuz Augustin and Inna, while production was handled by the first two under the name of Play Win. It is a dance pop song performed in English and its refrain in Arabic. Italian publication RnB Junk's Daniele Traino wrote that the track combined Inna's typical Eurodance style with oriental sounds, comparing its vibe to Madonna's La Isla Bonita 1987 . German portal Hitfire likened the recording to Major Lazer and DJ Snake featuring M's Lean On 2015 , writing that the success of the latter possibly influenced the singer to release Yalla as a single. A digital remixes extended play of the song was released on 3 November 2015 by Empire and Roton. The single version features an additional second verse not included on the version featured on her eponymous and fourth studio album 2015 and its Japanese counterpart Body and the Sun. Music critics were positive towards the recording. Traini from RnB Junk wrote that Yalla was one of the most captivating, refined and peculiar songs from Inna's eponymous studio album, noting its commercial appeal. An editor of Pro FM listed the recording in their list of 16 hits with which Inna made history . Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, said that the singer appeal to people around the world by including Arabic language in Yalla , while portal Hitfire commended the strong strophes of the song, Inna's vocals and the beat. The recording debuted on native Airplay at number 94 on 12 November 2015, climbing to number 80 the next week. It reached its peak position at number 13 on 1 May 2016. In Poland, Yalla reached position 18 on ZPAV's Dance Top 50 component chart. Inna performed a stripped down version of Yalla on Radio ZU on 17 November 2015. Yalla was set on the track list of concert tours that promoted Inna and Body and the Sun in Europe and Japan. The singer also provided live performances of the recording at festival Alba Fest held in Alba Iulia, Romania, and at the World Trade Center Mexico, An accompanying music video for Yalla was filmed by Barna Nemethi in Marrakesh, Morocco over three days, with Inna and John Perez acting as co directors. While both Perez and Bogdan Daragiu were the directors of photography, Khaled Mokhtar handled the editing process. The outfits worn in the clip were inspired by and adapted to Arab culture designers included Cristina Savulescu, Madalina Dorobantu from Pas du Tout, Wanda's Dream New York, Artizana and Tria Alfa. The music video was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 12 November 2015, with a teaser of it released few days prior. The clip features a dromedary, the second animal to appear in one of Inna's music videos after Diggy Down previously featured a snake. The video commences with Inna coming out from a body of water, following which she gets chased by a manplayed by Yassir Lamrani Selmane at a bazaar and through the surroundings of a building. This is followed by the singer and her female background dancers performing choreography. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Inna singing in front of a door, and her in a desert with a dromedary and dancing around a fire with her backup dancers. Regarding the singer's appearance in the music video, Yohann Ruelle of Pure Charts wrote, Inna knows how to turn on the temperature Valentina Malfroy from website Aficia commended the quality of the visual and saw Inna as charming. An editor of Vagalume thought Inna plays a girl who abuses her sensuality in typical costumes and a lot of Arabic dance to enchant her love interest. Currinn, writing in his own website, praised Inna's choreography and the video overall, whilst Hitfire recommended the clip and said it matched the song. After its release on YouTube, the music video attracted many comments written in Arabic. It received notable airplay in Romania, peaking at number seven on Media Forest's TV Airplay chart.

"The Yamaha NS 10 is a loudspeaker that became a standard nearfield studio monitor in the music industry among rock and pop recording engineers. Launched in 1978, the NS 10 started life as a bookshelf speaker destined for the domestic environment. It was poorly received but eventually became a valuable tool with which to mix rock recordings. The speaker has a characteristic white coloured midbass drive unit. Technically, it is known as a speaker that easily reveals poor quality in recordings. Recording engineers sought to dull its treble response by hanging tissue paper in front of it, resulting in what became known as the tissue paper effect , a type of comb filtering. The NS 10 has been used to monitor a large number of successful recordings by numerous artists, leading Gizmodo to refer to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of . Originally conceived as a domestic hi fi speaker, the NS 10 was designed by Akira Nakamura and launched in 1978. The speaker was poorly received. Recording engineers came to rely on the NS 10 as a benchmark. The model was discontinued in 2001. The NS 10 displaced the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor of choice in the 1980s and was recognised for its ability to reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS 10 for the first time and were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS 10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios. Early use of the NS 10 among engineers include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then a rising star in record production, is often credited for the popularity of the NS 10 Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS 10, as a reference. Recording studios around the world, particularly those specialising in rock and pop music, adopted the speaker as the standard. In excess of 200,000 pairs were sold throughout the world. Gizmodo referred to it as the most important loudspeaker you never heard of . Yamaha stopped manufacturing the speaker in 2001, citing problems sourcing the wood pulp for the drivers. Even years after it was discontinued, the speaker continued to be found in studios everywhere. Mix reported in 2008 that variants of the NS 10 were still commercially available in the Japanese consumer market. The NS 10 is an 8 ohm two way loudspeaker with a 10.4 litre Sealed cabinet measuring 382 215 199 millimetres 15.0 8.5 7.8 in and weighing 6 kilograms 13.2 lb . Its 2.5 cm 0.98 in particle board cabinet has a wood veneer skin with seven black finishing layers. The domestic version of the speaker was vertically orientated, and came factory fitted with a grille. Its two drivers are a 180 mm paper woofer and a 35 mm soft domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, weighing 3.7 g, is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. Against the black finish of the cabinet, the white bass mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic feature of the product. The network is second order passive, crossing over at 2 kHz. The frequency range is quoted from 60 Hz to 20 kHz, and rated power handling is 2550 W. The early version of the speaker has press down type input terminals later models had screw terminals. In simplistic terms, the NS 10 possesses sonic characteristics that allow record producers to assume that if a recording sounds good on these monitors, then it should sound good on most playback systems. Whilst it can reveal any shortcomings in the recording mix as well as the monitoring chain, it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting. The NS 10 does not have a perfectly flat frequency response. The sound of the NS 10 is slightly heavy in the midrange, and like other sealed box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a 5 dB boost in the midrange at around 2 kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200 Hz. The midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst sounding to the human ear. On a practical level for the music professional, the speaker is analytic and clinical sounding. Gizmodo likened the NS 10 to music editors who reveal the weaknesses of recordings, so that engineers would be forced to either make necessary compensation in the mix or otherwise rework them. A 2001 report by Newell et al. at Southampton University undertaken for Studio Sound in 2001 found that the NS 10 had excellent time domain response at low frequencies its ability to start and stop in response to signal input was found to be superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments guitar and drums are correctly balanced in the mix. There were many other versions of the NS 10, the best known of which were the NS 10M Studio and the NS 10M Pro , both introduced in 1987. Technically identical to the Studio , the Pro comes fitted with a speaker grille and is meant to be used in a vertical orientation. The professional version launched some nine years after its first introduction on the back of the popularity of the NS 10 among engineers. The revised version, with everything including the logo and connection panel orientated horizontally, was badged NS 10M Studio . Improvements included a new tweeter and crossover to address the problem in the treble, better connection terminals, and a sturdier cabinet that no longer accommodates grilles. The Studio reincarnation also has improved power handling 60120 W. In excess of 200,000 pairs of Studio alone were sold throughout the world. Also in the product line up were NS 10T, NS 10M X, NS 10MC, NS 10MT. The NS 10M X is a Studio with magnetic shielding and a different tweeter. In the 1990s Yamaha introduced the NS 10MT, a bass reflex version of the 10M X with a different tweeter and grille. Designed for home cinema, it has bass response down to 43 Hz, nominal impedance of 6 ohm and maximum power handling rated at 180 W. A miniature version named Natural Sound Surround Speaker NS10MM was launched in 1997 or 1998. The sound quality of the NS 10 has polarised opinions, characterised as love them or hate them . Many professionals find it indispensable, even though they may not particularly enjoy listening to it others refuse to give it space in their studio but will happily admit that it is an effective professional tool. The reliance on the NS 10 by top independent producers became a viral phenomenon thousands of studios equipped themselves with NS 10s to attract big named producers, making the speakers an industry standard. Clearmountain was said to have been one of the first recording engineers to hang tissue paper over the tweeters of the NS 10 to tame the over bright treble. Covering the tweeters with tissue paper was said to produce treble deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi fi. The phenomenon became the subject of hot debate. Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper. He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. Hodas derided the tissue practice as aberrant behaviour , saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter. The speaker came to be relied on by independent engineers, who worked in different studios and needed equipment they were familiar with as a reference point. Throughout the 1980s, engineers and producers worked widely with the speaker to monitor any album you love from the 80s or 90s from Born in the U.S.A. Bruce Springsteen , Avalon Roxy Music Let's Dance David Bowie , to Big Bam Boom Hall and Oates . The NS 10, and the Auratone before it, are two of the most influential nearfield monitors used in the professional mixing of sound recordings. In 2008, the NS 10 was inducted into the Mix magazine TECnology Hall of Fame. Also reflecting its influence, the speaker won a Technical Grammy for Yamaha in 2007. In 2008, the speaker was found in almost every studio . As the NS 10 has been out of production for many years, in late 2018 Avantone with Chris Lord Alge world famous mix engineer and proponent of the NS 10 released the CLA 10. Although they were careful not to mention it in any of the company's materials, many have speculated that the CLA 10 is an NS 10 clone, to fill the market gap left by Yamaha when they stopped production of the original NS 10. In January of 2019, Minneapolis Speaker Company launched a new brand of speakers called Bold North Audio. Their first product, the MS 10W, is stated to be the ideal replacement woofer for the NS 10M. The website includes copious amounts of engineering data showing driver and in system comparisons.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha%20NS-10
"Kanae Yamamoto , IPA ka.na.e , 24 October 1882 8 October 1946 was a Japanese artist, known primarily for his prints and yoga Western style paintings. He is credited with originating the sosaku hanga creative prints movement, which aimed at self expressive printmaking, in contrast to the commercial studio systems of ukiyo e and shin hanga. He initiated movements in folk arts and children's art education that continue to be influential in Japan. Kanae trained as a wood engraver in the Western style before studying Western style painting. While at art school he executed a two colour print of a fisherman he had sketched on a trip to Chiba. Its publication ignited an interest in the expressive potential of prints that developed into the sosaku hanga movement. Kanae spent 1912 to 1916 in Europe and brought ideas back to Japan gleaned from exhibitions of peasant crafts and children's art in Russia. In the late 1910s he founded movements the promotion of creative peasant crafts and in children's art education the latter quickly gained adherents but was suppressed under Japan's growing militarism. These ideas experienced a revival after World War II. Though always a supporter, Kanae left behind printmaking in the 1920s and devoted his artistic output to painting until he suffered a stroke in 1942. He spent his remaining years in mountainous Nagano in the city of Ueda, where the Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum was erected in 1962. Kanae Yamamoto descended from the Irie clan of hatamotosamurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate of feudal Japan in Edo modern Tokyo . His grandfather died 1868 in the Battle of Ueno, during the Boshin War which led to the fall of the Shogunate and the Meiji Restoration which returned power to the Emperor. This orphaned Kanae's father Ichiro, and thereafter he grew up in Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture how he got there is a matter of speculation. The specialist in Chinese medicine, Ryosai Yamamoto, from line of specialists in traditional Chinese medicine, took in Ichiro with the intention of raising him to marry his daughter Take, the eldest of the family's nine children. Kanae was born 24 October 1882 in the Tenma dori 1 chome neighbourhood of Okazaki. Ryosai intended Ichiro to continue the family profession, but when the Meiji government announced it would grant medical licenses only to those who practised Western medicine, Ichiro moved to Tokyo to study it shortly after Kanae's birth. He lodged in the household of Mori Ogai's father, where he performed household duties to earn his keep. To advance his studies he took part the clandestine digging up of fresh graves to find bodies for dissection. When he was five, Kanae and his mother joined Ichiro in Tokyo and settled in a tenement house in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama provided maid service to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Kaita Murayama, who, like Kanae, was to make a career in art. The painter Harada Naojiro, whom Ogai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art. Ichiro raised his son under the influence of the liberal educational principles of Nakae Chomin. Ichiro was responsible for the welfare of five of his wife's siblings, and so at age 11, after four years of primary school, the family finances did not permit Kanae's schooling to continue. He became an apprentice wood engraver and mastered Western techniques of tonal gradation in the workshop of Sakurai Torakichi in Shiba. His training focused on book and newspaper illustration, and included letterpress printing and photoengraving. His skill developed quickly and soon won praise from those he worked with. During this time printing technology underwent rapid change, brought to the forefront by the First Sino Japanese War, which was reported in a variety of media, from paintings and woodblock prints to photographs. Kanae completed his apprenticeship at 18, followed by an obligatory year of service with Sakurai. By 1896, Ichiro had earned his medical license and set up a practice in Kangawa now part of Ueda , a village in Nagano Prefecture. The rapid change in printing technology led Kanae to doubt his future prospects in wood engraving. He aspired to become a painter but knew his yet indebted father was not in a position to pay for art school. He secretly enrolled at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1902, where he studied yoga Western style painting. His instructors there included Masaki Naohiko , Toru Iwamura , and Kuroda Seiki. To pay for school, Kanae worked odd printing jobs for employers such as the Hochi Shimbun newspaper, and from February 1903 lodged at the home of his friend Ishii Hakutei, the eldest son of the artist Ishii Teiko . Kanae and the other aspiring artists lodged there talked into the night about art and hired a model for life drawing once a month. Kanae joined a group of friends in July 1904 on a trip to Choshi in Chiba Prefecture, where they stayed near the mouth of the Tone River. There he made a sketch of a fisherman dressed in ceremonial clothing overlooking a harbour. When he returned, he used the sketch as the basis of a wood engraving. He engraved on both sides of a single piece of wood the one side he printed in ochre, which filled in all the spaces except the towel on the fisherman's head the other he printed in black, which provided outlines and details. At the time, the art establishment saw woodblock printing as a commercial venture beneath the station of an aspiring fine artist. Hakutei noticed the print and had it published in the July issue of the literary magazine Myojo. In a column in the issue Ishii promoted the print as revolutionary, as it had been done as a means of painterly spontaneous self expression, and used methods Ishii associated with ukiyo e traditions. Soon the style Ishii dubbed toga became a popular topic within Myojo circles. This was to grow into the sosaku hanga creative prints movement. Fisherman, woodblock print, 1904 Mosquito Net, oil painting, 1905 Hosun Vol. 4 No. 4, 1910, inset colour print by Kanae In summer 1905 Kanae visited his parents in Nagano, where he produced the oil painting Mosquito Net, the earliest of his oil paintings to be made public. That September Kanae, Hakutei and Tsuzuro Ishii, and some other friends founded the short lived magazine Heitan in which they published a number of their prints. It was in Heitan that the word hanga first appeared. The word was used interchangeably with toga until the magazine came to an end in April 1906 thereafter toga fell out of use and hanga went on to become the modern Japanese word for prints in general. Kanae learned in 1906 of the financial strain his parents still faced with their continuing responsibility for his mother's siblings. He moved out of the Ishiis' home on 8 March 1906 and rented a residence in Morikawa cho in Hongo Ward of Tokyo determined to pursue financial independence. He graduated on 2 April 1906 from the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, and in his graduation yearbook declared the French painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes his favourite artist. He took work at Rakuten Kitazawa's Tokyo Puck, a cartoon humour magazine patterned after the American Puck. Kanae felt disappointed at hand printing's gradual loss of prestige in Japan to revive interest he wrote a four part series of articles in 1907 for the art magazine Mizu e examining a wide variety of printing media and techniques. Kanae, Hakutei, and a former art school classmate of Kanae's, Morita Tsunetomo, founded the monthly magazine Hosun. whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907. It was patterned on such European magazines as Cocorico, Jugend, Simplicissimus. The contents were primarily literature, criticism, and art cartoons, and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design. They printed the magazine on fine paper at an unusually large size and mixed colour reproduction with black and white. Kanae's contributions included his own prints, haiku poetry, and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others. Kanae's former engraving teacher Sakurai Torakichi furnished the photographic printing plates. The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae. The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores. It sold well, and the circle of contributors grew, as did the page count, which expanded to sixteen. Tokyo during the Meiji period 18681912 had a great openness to foreignespecially Europeaninfluence, and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo e had had on art in the West. Artists who had all but abandoned the culture of the Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches. Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian cafes such as Cafe Guerbois of the Impressionists. At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings, a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below, wrapped in a shoji paper screen he returned to the gathering as if nothing had happened. The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published. Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911. Kanae wanted to revive the spirit of Edo period ukiyo e in his prints, and to this end in 1911 he founded the Tokyo Print Club to produce and distribute such prints. He advertised for members in Hosun, but after the magazine's demise most of the associated artists left Tokyo and the only member he could recruit was Hanjiro Sakamoto. The pair began a series titled Soga butai sugata Stage Figure Sketches of portraits of kabuki actors in the vein of the yakusha e genre of ukiyo e. The subjects were sketched from performances at the just built Imperial Theatre and were captioned in French on the front and on the back in Japanese. Though Kanae had announced that prints were to come from thirty four theatre pieces only three sets of four printstwo by each artist in each setappeared in June, July, and September that year. The work represents a major turning point in his career as he turned away from the Western techniques that had defined his work toward a more Japanese approach such as the use of flat areas of colour. The prints failed to sell at first but began to find buyers only after he had left for France the following year. As Kanae was away the printer was not able to issue a second printing to meet the demand. Kanae had come to neglect Hosun as he devoted himself to Soga butai sugata. Hakutei and Tsunetomo had left Tokyo, and that July the magazine came to an end after thirty five issues. Kanae had wanted to marry Mitsu Ishii, but her family forbade itespecially her mother and brother Hakutei. This rejection embittered him and he broke his friendship with Hakutei, though he remained friends with Tsuruzo. Kanae wished to study painting in Paris, so his father organized the distribution and sale of his son's work to raise funds for it while he was away. He set off on the Tango Maru from Kobe on 6 July 1912, and fifty three days later landed in Marseilles. While on board he made what was likely the first of the prints he father was to sell for him by subscription titled Wild Chickens, it depicted three Chinese prostitutes with bound feet inspired by prostitutes he saw when he passed through Shanghai. He printed it in Paris, where in his first few months he studied etching at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Upon arrival Kanae contacted the painter Sanzo Wada, who had been in Paris since 1907. Wada introduced him to Kunishiro Mitsutani, and Kanae soon moved into a studio next to Mitsutani's. He found French difficult to master and associated mostly with expatriate Japanese artists such as Ryuzaburo Umehara and Sotaro Yasui. His closest friend there was Misei Kosugi, a contributor to Hosun who arrived in March 1913 to spend a year travelling Europe. In 1913 the writer Toson Shimazaki visited Kanae, whom he had known from Ueda. The two shared the recent experience of having been denied a marriage. Toson wrote of the print On the Deck that Kanae was finding difficult to finish a print of a long haired woman on the deck of the Tango Maru as it was in Singapore. It was made with six cherry woodblocks on mulberry washi paper, materials Kanae had brought from Japan. The print was sent to Japan that May. The pair went to seaside Brittany for six weeks from that July, and soon were joined by a number of other artists, all of whom were drawn there by the tales of the beauty of the region Kuroda Seiki had written in the 19th century. Kanae was particularly productive of prints while in Brittany. Kanae felt isolated from the culture and found little art there that he appreciated. He disliked the paintings of van Gogh, Monet, and Edouard Manet. He liked the works of Renoir and Sisley, and Puvis de Chavannes, admired the paintings of Cezanne, but denied any connection between them and those of the Cubists whose works he denigrated he wrote that only one in three thousand paintings of Matisse were good. Kanae imagined himself a realist and was distressed at the avant garde that was coming to dominate the European art world he found it difficult to comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art. His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokuro Watanabe, send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first hand the impact Japanese art had had there. Though he kept such thoughts to himself he began to feel a sense of the superiority of Japanese artof the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training. Kanae managed to acquire funds from connections and refused to return early to Japan despite the urgings of friends and associates. Troubles thickened in mid 1914 when World War I broke out and he learned that Mitsu Ishii had married. The war drove him from Paris to London where he stayed for four months, much of it sick with bronchitis. He returned to Paris on 11 January 1915, but work was scarce and the museums were closed. He resolved to return to Japan the following spring, but first moved with a group of Japanese compatriots to Lyon where he found work that brought in enough money for a trip to Italy in March 1916 to see the Renaissance masterpieces. Upon returning to Lyon he learned of the death of Sakurai and finally prepared to go back to Japan. The least expensive route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. In Moscow he met the Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, While I was staying in Moscow in the summer of 1916, I felt that I had two important missions. One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art. Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness. Towards the end of 1916 Kanae made the long rail trip across Siberia. Along the way he received a telegram from the poet Hakushu Kitahara. The two had been negotiating the hand of Kitahara's sister Ieko and had finally reached an agreement. Kanae returned to Japan in December 1916 and took over Sakurai's struggling printing company, which he renamed Seiwado. In autumn 1917 he had seventeen yoga oil paintings displayed at the Nihon Bijutsuin's Inten exhibition. The same year he married Ieko Kitahara, had an instruction book on oil painting published, and finished a number of prints whose subscriptions had been paid for. Kanae aimed at putting together a creative prints association. In June 1918 Kanae co founded the Nihon Sosaku Hanga Kyokai Japan Creative Print Cooperative Society with lithographer Kazuma Oda, etcher Takeo Terasaki, and woodblock artist Kogan Tobari this last had been a member of the Pan no Kai and had also recently returned from several years in Europe. The group held its first exhibition at the art gallery in the Mitsukoshi building in Nihonbashi on 1520 January 1919. It represented 277 works by 26 artists, including seventeen woodblock prints and two etchings by Kanae. The show drew twenty thousand visitors and was widely reported in the media, including a special sosaku hanga issue that March of the prominent art magazine Mizu e which included an article in which Kanae outlined the principles of the artform and the goals of the Nihon Sosaku Hanga Kyokai. That May the show was repeated at the Mitsukoshi location in Osaka. In 1919 Kanae founded the Japan Children's Free Drawing Association and held its first exhibition. The public was impressed by its democratic ideals, as the idea of democratic education was gaining momentum in Japan during the Taisho period 191226 . Kanae propounded the importance of teaching students freedom, without which they cannot grow, and denigrated the tradition of teaching drawing through copying. He promoted this ideas in 1921 with the book Free Drawing Education and the monthly magazine Education of Arts and Freedom. Kanae's methods were widely adopted, and it became common for teachers to take students outdoors to draw from nature. These ideas did not escape criticism, and the rise of militarism in Japan put an end to Kanae's movement in 1928 it was not to be revived until after World War II. Later in 1919 Kanae moved to Ueda, the mountainous Nagano village where his parents lived. He secured funding from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, and Mitsubishi to set up a school that December to teach to the rural population arts and crafts skills they could use to augment their incomes during the long winter months as part of a peasant art movement that combined creativity and utility, inspired by the peasant crafts he had seen in Russia. In 1921, brothers in law Rinzo Satake and Shoko Sasaki consulted with Kanae to develop a pastel crayon with an oil binder development took three years and resulted in the world's first oil pastel, marketed under the name Cray Pas through the Sakura Color Products Corporation. The peasant art movement had success in intellectual and government circles. A show at Mitsukoshi of works by sixteen youths was well received. In 1923 Kanae established the Japan Peasant Art Institute which expanded throughout the country with the help of increased government funding in 1925. Critics of the movement saw it as an anachronism or of stripping rural handicrafts of their original charm through commercialism Kanae saw movement as motivated by a desire to keep creative vitality alive, and not by a sense of nostalgia or desire to preserve older ways. The police suspected Kanae of socialist sympathies as he had brought the idea from Russia. The police so harassed him that he asked Un'ichi Hiratsuka, who was teaching frame making there, to give up wearing his Russian style jacket and to cut his long hair. Kanae's initial enthusiasm dwindled over the next five yearsfunding shrank, finding other patrons was wearying, the village mayor went bankrupt, and his attempts to find ways for the farmers to make money off their artwork found little success. After five years the venture went bankrupt. Kanae turned his focus from printmaking to painting. He was a founding member in 1922 of the Shunyokai association for painters who wished to maintain connections with Japanese traditions in the face of the Westernization of academic painting in Japan. He was editor of the association's members' magazine Atorie. He continued to promote the work of print artists and the legitimacy of prints as art. In 1928 the magazine devoted an issue to sosaku hanga, and from the same year Shunyokai included a prize in the print category in its annual exhibitions. In 1924 Kanae travelled to Taiwan for a month to observe local folk craft and advise the government on how to develop the industry. The utilitarian craftwork of the aboriginal Taiwanese people impressed him beyond his expectations. Taiwanese authorities thought to promote the production of bamboo and rattan craftwork, but Kanae thought they could not compete with similar products from Japan and promoted instead the production of products both traditional and new with a distinctive local flavour using traditional designs for sale as souvenirs and exports. After the 1919 show, Kanae passed the leadership of the Nihon Sosaku Hanga Kyokai to Koshiro Onchi. In 1931 it became the more comprehensive Nihon Hanga Kyokai Japan Print Cooperative Society . The same year the Seiwado printing company went out of business. In 1935 Kanae settled in Tokyo and returned to painting full time. He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery. The show was well received and attended, and in a dinner that followed Kanae proclaimed, I shall live until May of my eighty fifth year. Therefore, I am going to sit back now, and drink sake, and paint to my heart's content. While at by Lake Haruna in Gunma Prefecture in 1942 Kanae suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which partially paralyzed him and hindered his ability to paint. He continued to paint as much as he could for the rest of his life, hindered by war shortages, and turned to watercolour when oil painting was too demanding under his disability. In spring 1943 he moved to Ueda in Nagano where he spent his remaining years. He died on 8 October 1946 undergoing surgery for a volvulus at the Nisshindo hospital in Ueda. In his prints, Kanae's primary tool was a curved blade chisel in ukiyo e this tool was normally for clean up and a straight chisel for the main carving. His carving followed the Western approach of carving out planes and lines to appear in white, whereas the traditional Japanese technique was to carve around the lines to be printed. Chinese Woman, 1917 Dutch Girl in Landscape, 1915 Breton Woman, 1920 Fishermen Summer in Brittany, 1913 Portrait of Hama Takahashi, 1917 Signs of Autumn at the Foot of Mount Tokko, 1926 Mount Fuji from Kami Ide, 1938 Iizuna Highlands, 1939 When an idea excited him he would bury himself in it. Sacrifice meant nothing. It was the same with creative hanga, his school, and his free art movement. He was a selfless man, a passionate man, a man of great sensitivity. I guess if I had to describe him in one word it would beartist. Kanae's European work had an immediate effect on artists of his generation. In them Koshiro Onchi saw the potential of the woodcut medium, though his style owes more to European artists. Un'ichi Hiratsuka came to believe a real artist ... must cut his own blocks and do his own printing as Durer and Bewick worked . Sosaku hanga artists followed Kanae's lead in using a curved chisel to carve out planes rather than to define lines as in Japanese tradition. The dating of most of Kanae's work is uncertain. It is believed that the works he signed in Roman characters were made after he returned to Japan from Europe. The number of copies of Kanae's prints is unknown it is supposed the subscription prints he made in Europe numbered around 25 to 50. Kanae made few printings of the Fisherman printperhaps only one or twoand none have survived. The Ishiis discovered the block in their house decades later, and Oliver Statler had Hashimoto Okiie made forty copies of a commemorative edition in 1960. Modern Japanese thought on art education begins with Kanae's Free Drawing Education approach. His stature in the history of child art and art education is similar to that of Franz Cizek's in the West. Elementary schools teachers took to his ideas quickly in the wake of their dissatisfaction with the New Textbooks of Drawing textbooks the government had mandated in 1910 that emphasized copying and neglected personal expression. Yamamoto's was the first public criticism of the textbooks, and his methods led to a sharp decline in their use in the 1920s. Yamamoto encouraged teachers to take children outdoors to sketch, a practice that continues to be common in Japanese elementary schools. Though Japanese militarism put his ideas on hold from the late 1920s educators revived and expanded them beginning in the 1950s. The municipal Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum in Ueda in Nagano Prefecture dates from 1962. It houses 1,800 items, including artwork and documents by Kanae and early examples of peasant crafts and children's artwork done under his instruction.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanae%20Yamamoto%20%28artist%29
"Michiru Yamane Japanese , Hepburn Yamane Michiru, born September 23, 1963 is a Japanese video game composer and pianist. Yamane's musical style draws on baroque, classical and rock traditions, with both Johann Sebastian Bach and Yellow Magic Orchestra as prominent influences. She is best known for her two decades of work at the gaming company Konami, with her compositions for the Castlevania series among her most recognized work. Yamane grew an interest in music at an early age, practicing on the electric organ and piano. She studied composition in college and began working as a composer for Konami in 1988. As a member of the Konami Kukeiha Club, she collaborated with other musicians on many Konami video games. Her breakthrough work came with the Castlevania games Bloodlines 1994 and Symphony of the Night 1997 . Yamane was born in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan, on September 23, 1963. She began learning electric organ around the age of four, on her family's Yamaha Electone. She also soon began learning piano. Yamane enjoyed playing popular rock music on the organ, but grew a fascination with classical music with her piano studies. She began composing around eight years old, and realized by her teenage years that she wanted to write songs for movies or commercials, or be a jazz pianist. She attended a music high school that specialized in advanced piano courses, and focused her studies around harmonic rhythm, counterpoint, and music theory. Around this time, she also began playing video games at the arcades. She decided not to compete at performance with virtuoso players, so decided to attend the Aichi Prefectural University of the Arts and focus on the strong composition courses they offered. In college, she learned how to write music for large orchestras, and did her thesis on German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. She also continued gaming on a friend's Famicom at the time. Yamane started working for Konami in 1988, shortly before her fourth year at college. She held a teaching license at the time, and was teaching part time, though she felt the job did not suit her. She applied to Konami after finding an open position through her college recruitment office, and was hired. She had never considered specifically becoming a game composer, although she liked games and music. At Konami, Yamane was a member of the Konami Kukeiha Club, the company's sound team. She was nervous she would be required to do frequency modulation programming, but she was only a composer at first. She would later be introduced to computer music sequencing programs in graduate school. Yamane's first work at the company were the main themes for King's Valley II and Risa no Yosei Densetsu 1988 . She also became involved with the Track and Field games, composing short victory jingles. Following that, she worked on several Game Boy, Famicom, MSX, and arcade games. Many of the first projects she collaborated on were shoot 'em ups, including the Nemesis series and Detana TwinBee. She compared the synchronicity of sound in shooters to that of Disney animated films. Yamane felt these games were a good introduction to the Konami sound and helped build her foundation. At first, she found it limiting working with only three simultaneous sound channels on the Famicom, given her orchestra composition background, but she grew to enjoy working around the limit over time. She drew motivation from Bach's Inventions and Sinfonias , which also only used two or three simultaneous notes. Yamane's first job as a lead composer was with Ganbare Goemon 2 1989 . With this game, she learned how to edit programmable sound generator samples from senior sound programmers. Although she is credited in some Contra games, Yamane does not have any memory of composing music for the series. She believes it is possible she contributed a couple tracks, as the sound team was very busy across multiple projects at the time. She also worked on Rocket Knight Adventures 1993 and its two sequels writing music for Sparkster and creating sound effects for Sparkster Rocket Knight Adventures 2. Akira Yamaoka joined Konami around this time, and worked with Yamane on the latter. Yamane is primarily known for her work on the Castlevania series. After moving to Konami's Tokyo office from Kobe, her boss thought she would be a good fit for the Castlevania game in development, Castlevania Bloodlines 1994 . Since the series was already popular and known for good music, she felt pressure to perform well. She was asked to write music based on pre existing themes introduced in earlier games. Yamane felt there was a link with the game's vampiric themes and the classical music she had grown up with. She worked to integrate her classical style with the rock themes previously introduced in the series. When working on Mega Drive games, Yamane was required to program the music into the game, on top of composition. GamesRadar called Bloodlines her first breakthrough game soundtrack. The next game in the series, Castlevania Symphony of the Night 1997 , was developed for the PlayStation. The art director, Osamu Kasai, requested Yamane to join the team. Because it used CD ROMs, the system was capable of much higher quality music and sound. Yamane felt more expressive freedom as she was no longer limited to FM chips and could use real sounds. For Symphony of the Night, she drew heavy inspiration from concept artwork by Ayami Kojima. She used an Akai sampler connected to a computer running Logic Pro and Pro Tools to record music. The soundtrack was the first time she attempted placing rock music in a game. It remains one of her most popular soundtracks. In addition to the soundtrack, she also produced all the sound effects due to a shortage of staff. Yamane continued to remain deeply involved with Koji Igarashi and the Castlevania development team after Symphony of the Night, reviewing artwork and scenario writings for further games. She worked on Lament of Innocence 2003 and Curse of Darkness 2005 , which made for challenging compositions. She also composed for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS games, which had note limitations like older home consoles. She broadened her listening habits to gain more inspiration and prevent her music from becoming repetitive. On Portrait of Ruin 2006 , she collaborated with Yuzo Koshiro. The last Castlevania score she wrote was for Order of Ecclesia 2008 , which she worked on with Yasuhiro Ichihashi. She says that out of the scores she did for the handheld game Aria of Sorrow 2003 , Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia are her favorite. While working on the Castlevania series, Yamane also composed for other games. She contributed to Suikoden III 2002 and Suikoden IV 2004 , following in the tracks of Miki Higashino's work on the first two games. After Suta Fujimori joined Konami, when Yamane worked with him on Gungage 1999 and Elder Gate 2000 , mixing her classic symphonic style with his modern electronic music. She also worked on the Winning Eleven series and The Sword of Etheria 2005 . After writing music for over 40 games at Konami, Yamane left the company in 2008 to become a freelance composer. She came to this decision after getting a pet cat, and growing a desire to slow down her career and move to working from home. She desired to have more freedom to do projects she wanted, and manage her own time. Since becoming a freelance composer, Yamane has continued to compose for video games, as well as films, commercials, television, and anime. She has considered making a solo album. Games that she has composed for include Otomedius Excellent 2011 and Skullgirls 2012 . Although no longer working directly for Konami, she has continued working with the company on Castlevania music. She is also composing for Koji Igarashi's Bloodstained Ritual of the Night. Yamane occasionally performs in live concerts. Her first live performance was a song from Symphony of the Night at the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig in 2006. She wrote music for a Castlevania arrangement box set, and played live at Castlevania The Concert in Stockholm in 2010. In 2015, she played with other Japanese composers at the Game Sound Maniax concert in China. Game Developer magazine called Yamane's music old, gothic, Victorian style . Yamane feels she grew an interest in dark classical through her Bach studies in college. She has also drawn inspiration from other composers including Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin. In high school, Yamane listened to Kraftwerk, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Yellow Magic Orchestra YMO , with the latter being considered a major influence on many Japanese game composers. She has also drawn inspiration, and enjoys listening to Dream Theater. She has expressed inspiration from many genres including techno pop, progressive rock, film scores, folk, jazz, rock, bossa nova, and contemporary classical music. She enjoys film scores by composers such as Jerry Goldsmith, and enjoyed American pop in her youth from artists like Barry Manilow, Burt Bacharach, Eric Carmen, The Doobie Brothers, and The Eagles. Yamane has expressed enjoying music from other game composers, particularly Nobuo Uematsu, Hitoshi Sakimoto, Yoko Kanno, and Motoi Sakuraba. She also explained that Tomb Raider and its sequel influenced the way she thought about sound design. Yamane contributed music to over 40 games at Konami. As a member of the Konami Kukeiha Club, Yamane frequently collaborated with other composers, arrangers, and sound programmers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michiru%20Yamane
"Yamashita Yoshitsugu , February 16, 1865 October 26, 1935, also known as Yamashita Yoshiaki , was a Japanese judoka. He was the first person to have been awarded 10th degree red belt judan rank in Kodokan judo, although posthumously. He was also one of the Four Guardians of the Kodokan, and a pioneer of judo in the United States. Yamashita was born in Kanazawa, then the capital of the powerful Kaga Domain. His father was of the samurai class. As a boy, Yamashita trained in the traditional koryu Japanese martial arts schools of Yoshin ryu and Tenjin Shin'yo ryu jujutsu. In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo dojo of his childhood friend Kano Jigoro as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt shodan rank in three months, fourth degree yondan ranking in two years, and sixth degree rokudan in fourteen years. He was prone to discuss the philosophy of judo with Kano, as Yamashita initially believed power should be applied before technique. He was a member of the Kodokan team that competed with Tokyo Metropolitan Police jujutsu teams during the mid 1880s, and during the 1890s, his jobs included teaching judo at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy and Tokyo Imperial University modern University of Tokyo . His role as a Kodokan competitor was specially notable in the Kodokan Totsuka rivalry, in 1886. He fought and dominated famed jujutsuka Taro Terushima, although the match went to a draw when Terushima resorted to groundwork. He later rematched him, knocking him out with a hard ippon seoi nage. A notoriously violent man, Yamashita was known for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to the fact that some of them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way he liked to harm people. In February 1902, Seattle based railroad executive Samuel Hill decided that his 9 year old son, James Nathan, should learn judo, which he had apparently seen or heard about while on a business trip to Japan. In Hill's words, the idea was for the boy to learn the ideals of the Samurai class, for that class of men is a noble, high minded class. They look beyond the modern commercial spirit. Hill spoke to a Japanese American business associate, Masajiro Furuya, for advice. Furuya referred Hill to Kazuyoshi Shibata, who was a student at Yale University. Shibata told Hill about Yamashita, and on July 21, 1903, Hill wrote a letter to Yamashita, asking him to come to Seattle at Hill's expense. On August 26, 1903, Yamashita replied, writing that he, his wife, and one of his students Saburo Kawaguchi would leave for Seattle on September 22, 1903. The ship carrying the Yamashita party docked in Seattle on October 8, 1903. A week later, on October 17, 1903, Yamashita and Kawaguchi gave a judo exhibition at a Seattle theater that Hill had rented for the evening. Attendance was by invitation only, and guests included Sam Hill's mother in law, Mary Hill wife of railroader J.J. Hill , Senator Russell Alger, and assorted Sportswriters. Afterwards, Hill took the Yamashita party east to Washington, D.C., where Mrs. Hill and young James Nathan were then living. Meanwhile, the favorable publicity surrounding the event caused Japanese Americans living in Seattle to start their own judo club, known as the Seattle Dojo. Soon after arriving in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attache, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt practiced wrestling and boxing while in the White House, and he had received jujutsu jackets from William Sturgis Bigelow and jujutsu lessons from J. J. O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer who had studied jujutsu while living in Nagasaki. Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo lessons to the President and interested family and staff in a room at the White House. Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave lessons to prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth sister of Kindergarten pioneer Susan Blow , Hallie Elkins wife of Senator Stephen Benton Elkins , and Grace Davis Lee Hallie Elkins' sister , and their children. In January 1905, Yamashita got a job teaching judo at the U.S. Naval Academy. There were about 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley. The position ended at the end of the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year. When President Roosevelt heard of this, he spoke to the Secretary of the Navy, who in turn told the Superintendent of the Naval Academy to rehire Yamashita. Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout the first six months of 1906. At the end of the 1906 academic year, Yamashita left the United States for Japan. On July 24, 1906, he participated in a conference in Kyoto that had been called for the purpose of standardizing judo forms kata that could be taught in Japanese public schools. From the 1910s to the 1930s, Yamashita worked as a judo teacher at Tokyo Higher Normal School , Tokyo Koto Shihan Gakko . In this capacity, he often attended judo tournaments and exhibitions. He also taught judo to the Tokyo Municipal Police. Thus, from September 1924 to April 1926, Yamashita was part of a committee that developed a new kata for Japanese police. An example of Yamashita's teaching method is the advice Yamashita's last major public appearance was probably the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Kodokan, an event which took place in November 1934. British judoka Sarah Mayer described Yamashita's participation as follows His ultimate promotion to 10th dan was posthumous.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%20Yoshitsugu
"Kira Yamato Japanese is a fictional character first introduced as the protagonist from the 2002 Japanese anime television series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, which was produced by Sunrise as part of the Gundam franchise. In the series, Kira is a first generation Coordinator, a genetically enhanced human being born of normal humans Naturals . At the beginning of Gundam SEED, Kira lives on the neutral space colony Heliopolis to avoid the war between the Coordinators and the Naturals, but the colony becomes involved in the war shortly thereafter. Kira is the only person within the Earth Alliancethe Naturals' military factionwho is able to effectively pilot their mobile suita type of a mecha created by them. He is forced to become a mobile suit pilot and to participate in various battles to protect his friends. Kira has also been featured in Gundam SEED's direct sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, in which he fights to stop a new war between the races' military organizations. Kira has also appeared in the manga adaptations from the two TV series as well as the film compilations. Various video games from the Gundam franchise as well as crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot from mobile suits. Director Mitsuo Fukuda regarded Kira's actions as based on Japanese people's thoughts, and emphasized a large development occurring to his character across the series. He is voiced in the Japanese series by Soichiro Hoshi. In English, he is voiced by Matt Hill in the Ocean English dub, and by Max Mittelman in the NYAV English dub. Kira is one of the most popular characters in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for favorite male characters, often coming in first or second between 2002 and 2005. His character has also been well received by publications for manga, anime and other media due to his personality and role in both Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny. At the start of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Kira is a shy, friendly teenager living peacefully in the Heliopolis colony. Kira is a highly skilled computer programmer who assists with research and development at the Heliopolis technical college, where he is a student. When a war between the Naturals and Coordinators is brought to Heliopolis, Kira takes control of a mobile suit, the GAT X105 Strike GAT X105 , to protect his friends from ZAFTthe military organization of the Coordinators. Born as a Coordinator, Kira's advanced mental and physical skills allow him to skillfully control the Strike. Kira is shocked when he discovers that his childhood friend Athrun Zala is a member of ZAFT. When they last met, Athrun gave Kira his robotic pet Birdy , Tori as a sign of their enduring friendship, voiced by Naomi Shindou in the Japanese anime and Tabitha St. Germain in the English dub which Kira is often seen with. Several survivors from Heliopolis are brought on board the Archangel and Kira defends them from enemy attacks until they arrive in Alaska on Earth. Kira has strong reservations against fighting, fearing he may confront Athrun and that he may kill a person. After manipulation by Flay Allster, Kira gradually becomes more aggressive when defending the Archangel to the point where he could kill a person without hesitation. During one of the Archangel's battles against ZAFT, the Strike suffers multiple damages by Athrun and Kira is declared missing in action. He is found alive but injured by Reverend Malchio, who transports him to a space colony known as PLANT where most coordinators reside and is ZAFT's homebase. There, his wounds are treated by Lacus Clyne, a Coordinator who befriended Kira when she was taken aboard the Archangel and was used as a hostage. After hearing that ZAFT plans to attack the base his friends are staying at, Kira decides to continue battling to bring the war to an end. Lacus then gives Kira ZAFT's new mobile suit, ZGMF X10A Freedom ZGMF X10A , which he uses to accompany the Archangel, whose objective has also changed to ending the war. When piloting Freedom Kira is noted to avoid hitting enemy mobile suits' cockpits to reduce the number of human casualties. Kira joins the Archangel and Lacus' faction to fight both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT to stop both sides from destroying each other. Kira learns of his origins from ZAFT commander Rau Le Creuset during these battles. Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements were intended to be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until the latter half of the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to believe they were his biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end. During Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Kira has been living in the secluded Marshall Islands since the end of the war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war assisting Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, ZGMF X20A Strike Freedom ZGMF X20A , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates. Besides the television series, Kira appears in the original video animation OVA Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus. Following Durandal's death, Kira meets Shinn and they promise to work for a peaceful future. He is also featured in two films, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Special Edition and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Special Edition, which retell the events from the television series. In the latter film's ending, Kira becomes a member of ZAFT after the war ends. Kira is featured in the manga adaptations of Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny. Kira's designs, according to Masatsugu Iwaseauthor of the Gundam SEED mangawas intended to be that of a spineless wimp while not making him look too childish , but he later decided to make him a strong character in the manga. The manga Mobile Suit Gundam SEED The Edge Desire features a story about Kira's recovery following Freedom's destruction. The manga series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray explores Kira's survival after the Strike's defeat a technician named Lowe Guele finds Kira wounded and takes him to Reverend Malchio. Although Kira appears only at the end, his defeat is the objective of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED X Astray's protagonist, Canard Pars. In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Astray Kira makes a brief appearance he kidnaps Cagalli from Orb during the events of Gundam SEED Destiny. He has also been featured in two character CDs from the series, with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, Soichiro Hoshi. Kira has also appeared in various video games in the Gundam franchise, including Gundam Seed Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. and its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II. He is the main playable character in the mobile phone game Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Phase Act Delivery. He appears in the Gundam fighting crossover games Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 and Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3 with Strike Freedom as a playable mobile suit. Other Gundam crossover games also feature Kira as a pilot including Gundam vs. Gundam Next and Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs.. Another crossover game in which he is playable is Gundam Assault Survive, piloting the Strike. Kira, along with other Gundam SEED characters, appears in several video games from the Super Robot Wars series. He appears in Another Century's Episode 3 piloting the Freedom mobile suit and its follow up, Another Century's Episode R, with the Strike Freedom. Director Mitsuo Fukuda stated that initially the story of Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count of the number of times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him. Kira's inclusion in Destiny was made in order to tell a story from three people's point of views Kira's, Athrun's and Shinn. His characterization was made to change briefly across the story as Kira faced Gilbert Durandal's ideals and became a person more compromised with war in contrast to his original pacifist persona after this incarnation was challenged multiple other characters in regards to his actions in he battlefield. In the Japanese version of the series, Kira is voiced by Soichiro Hoshi. Hoshi expressed joy in voicing the character and was happy when redoing his character's lines for the remaster of the series. One of Hoshi's favorite lines in the franchise is I still have a world I want to protect in the final episode of SEED when facing Raw as he felt it was heartwarming. For the English dub, he is voiced by Matt Hill, who got the role thanks to a friend from the dub's director, who told Hill not to have too much energy when doing the voice. The line Kira Yamato Launching was repeated by Hill several times when obtaining the role. Hill remembers enjoying his work, having taken a liking to the character. Kira's character has been well received by anime viewers, appearing various times in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for the favorite male characters category. He ranked first in 2002, second in 2003 and 2004, first in 2005, and second in 2006. In a NHK poll, he was voted as the fourth best Gundam character. In a Newtype poll, Kira was voted the second most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In another poll focused on all of the characters in the Gundam franchise, Kira was voted the most popular. In a poll organized by Sunrise to find the best couple in the Gundam franchise, Kira and Lacus were second, and in another regarding the best team ups between former enemies, Kira and Athrun were second. In another poll from the same site that asked fans which character would they would want to meet, Kira was the most popular. Kira was most popular in two other polls which asked readers who the most memorable characters from Gundam SEED and from Gundam SEED Destiny were. Kira, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the Gundam series, was recognized in the second set of Anime Heroes and Heroines stamps, released in Japan in 2005. In the 2007 Seiyu Awards, Soichiro Hoshi was a nominee in the category Best Actors in supporting roles for his portrayal as Kira in the Gundam SEED Destiny OVA, but lost to Akira Ishida and Koki Miyata. In 2017, Kira was voted as the best Gundam main character. Manga and anime publications have commented on Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable and the only problem he found was how he often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said he was one of the strongest characters from the series Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits and his ability to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise. Also writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about how much Kira's and Athrun's relationship would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked that Lacus Clyne's introduction added tension to it. Ever Cheung from Animefringe who wondered about the future of Kira and Lacus because the two are about to embrace in the anime's opening sequence. He said, If that's real, this story may be more interesting than I thought ... Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira's and Athrun's rivalry which resulted in well done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira to be similar to other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the reluctant hero . Reviewers have also commented on Kira's role in the sequel Gundam SEED Destiny. Initial reviews mentioned his lack of appearances during the first episodes and whether the new characters could be as appealing as him. He was expected to return in the series to fight the new lead character Shinn Asuka. While writing an article for later episodes, Liversidge found Kira's actions more appealing than Shinn's, and was looking forward to them. Luis Cruz from Mania Entertainment found that Kira's character expansion developed depth, pointing to one of Kira's discussions with Athrun about the relation between people's dreams and conflicts. Anime News Network writer Carl Kimlinger said that in the series' OVA finale, Kira was highly developed. Kimlinger stated that Kira had grown into a martial leader of Buddha like calm and compassion , and that the last OVA allows viewers to enjoy his actions. Matt Hill's English language performance in the OVA was criticized in comparison with other voice actors from the series who were praised. HobbyConsolas listed him and Lacus as the 10th best couple in anime and manga due to the mutual caring in Seed Destiny as well their actions in the plot.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira%20Yamato
"Yamhad was an ancient Semitic kingdom centered on Halab Aleppo , Syria. The kingdom emerged at the end of the 19th century BC, and was ruled by the Yamhadite dynasty kings, who counted on both military and diplomacy to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions of its neighbors Mari, Qatna and Assyria, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly a century and a half, Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th century BC. Yamhad's population was predominately Amorite, and had a typical Bronze Age Syrian culture. Yamhad was also inhabited by a substantial Hurrian population that settled in the kingdom, adding the influence of their culture. Yamhad controlled a wide trading network, being a gateway between the eastern Iranian plateau and the Aegean region in the west. Yamhad worshiped the traditional Northwest Semitic deities, and the capital Halab was considered a holy city among the other Syrian cities as a center of worship for Hadad, who was regarded as the main deity of northern Syria. Little of Halab has been excavated by archaeologists, as Halab was never abandoned during its long history and the modern city is situated above the ancient site. Therefore, most of the knowledge about Yamhad comes from tablets discovered at Alalakh and Mari. The name Yamhad was likely an Amorite tribal name and is used synonymously with Halab when referring to the kingdom. The city of Halab was a religious center in northern Syria, and was mentioned by the name Ha lam, as a vassal of the Eblaite empire, which controlled most of Syria in the middle of the third millennium BC. Halab's fame as a Holy City contributed to its later prominence the main temple of the north Syrian storm god Hadad was located in the city, which was known as the City of Hadad . The name Halab as well as that of Yamhad appeared for the first time during the Old Babylonian period, when Sumu Epuh, the first Yamhadite king, was attested in a seal from Mari as the ruler of the land of Yamhad, which included, in addition to Halab, the cities of Alalakh and Tuba. Sumu Epuh consolidated the kingdom and faced Yahdun Lim of Mari who had a dynastic alliance with Yamhad to oppose Assyria, but eventually campaigned in the north threatening the kingdom. The Yamhadite king supported the Yaminite tribes and formed an alliance with other Syrian states including Urshu, Hassum and Carchemish, against the Mariote king who defeated his enemies, but was eventually killed by his son Sumu Yamam. The rise of Shamshi Adad I of Assyria proved more dangerous to Yamhad than Mari. The Assyrian king was an ambitious conqueror with the aim to rule Mesopotamia and the Levant, and styled himself as king of the world . Shamshi Adad surrounded Yamhad by way of alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu to the north and by conquering Mari to the east, forcing Zimri Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu Epuh welcomed Zimri Lim and aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari. Shamshi Adad's most dangerous alliance was with Qatna, whose king Ishi Addu became Assyria's agent at Yamhad's borders and married his daughter to Yasmah Adad, the son of the Assyrian king who was installed by his father as king of Mari. Sumu Epuh was apparently killed during his fight with Shamshi Adad and was succeeded by his son Yarim Lim I, who consolidated his father's kingdom and turned it into the most powerful kingdom in Syria and northern Mesopotamia. Yarim Lim surrounded Shamshi Adad by alliances with Hammurabi of Babylon and Ibal pi el II of Eshnunna, then in 1777 BC he advanced to the east conquering Tuttul and installing Zimri Lim as governor of the city. The death of the Assyrian king came a year later. Yarim Lim then sent his army with Zimri Lim, to restore his ancestors throne as an ally vassal to Yamhad, cementing the relationship through a dynastic marriage between the new Mariote king and Shibtu, the daughter of Yarim Lim. A tablet sent to Zimri Lim of Mari, describing Yarim Lim I authority. Yarim Lim spent the next years of his reign expanding the kingdom, which reached Mamma in the north. The Syrian city states were subdued through alliances or force Mamma, Ebla and Ugarit became vassals of Yamhad, while Qatna remained independent but came to peace with Yamhad following the death of its ally, the late Shamshi Adad I. A sample of Yarim Lim policy of diplomacy and war can be read in a tablet discovered at Mari, that was sent to the king of Der in southern Mesopotamia, which included a declaration of war against Der and its neighbor Diniktum, the tablet mentions the stationing of 500 Yamhadite warships for twelve years in Diniktum, and the Yamhadite military support of Der for 15 years. Yarim Lim's accomplishments elevated Yamhad into the status of a Great Kingdom and the Yamhadite king title became the Great King. Yarim Lim I was succeeded by his son Hammurabi I who had a peaceful reign. He was able to force Charchemish into submission, and sent troops to aid Hammurabi of Babylon against Larsa and Elam. The alliance ended after the Babylonian king sacked Mari and destroyed it. Babylon did not attack Yamhad, however, and the relations between the two kingdoms remained peaceful in later years the power vacuum caused by Mari's fall opened the way for Hammurabi to extend Yamhad's hegemony over the upper Khabur valley in the east, where the ruler of Shubat Enlil became his vassal. Hammurabi I was succeeded by his son Abba El I, whose reign witnessed the rebellion of the city Irridu, which was under the authority of prince Yarim Lim, Abba El's brother. The king responded to the rebellion by destroying Irridu, and compensating his brother by giving him the throne of Alalakh, thus creating a cadet branch of the dynasty. The era of Abba El I's successors is poorly documented, and by the time of Yarim Lim III in the mid 17th century BC, the power of Yamhad declined due to internal dissent. Yarim Lim III ruled a weakened kingdom, and although he imposed Yamhadite hegemony over Qatna, the weakening was obvious as Alalakh had become all but independent under the self declared king Ammitakum. In spite of this regression, the king of Yamhad remained the strongest king of the Syrian states, as he was referred to as a Great King by the Hittites, the diplomatic equal of the Hittite king. The rise of the Hittite kingdom in the north posed the biggest threat to Yamhad, although Yarim Lim III and his successor Hammurabi III were able to withstand the aggressions of the Hittite king Hattusili I through alliances with the Hurrian principalities. Hattusili chose not to attack Halab directly and began with conquering Yamhad's vassals and allies, starting with Alalakh in the second year of his Syrian campaigns c. 1650 BC Middle chronology or slightly later. Hattusili then turned to attack the Hurrians in Urshu northeast of Halab, and won in spite of military support from Halab and Carchemish for the Hurrians. The Hittite king then defeated Yamhad in the battle of Mount Atalur, and sacked Hassum along with several other Hurrian cities in the sixth year of his Syrian wars. After many campaigns, Hattusili I finally attacked Halab during the reign of Hammurabi III. The attack ended in a defeat, the wounding of the Hittite king and his later death c. 1620 BC. Hattusili's campaigns considerably weakened Yamhad, causing it to decline in status the monarch ceased to be styled a Great King. Hattusili was succeeded by his grandson Mursili I, who conquered Halab c. 1600 BC and destroyed Yamhad as a major power in the Levant. Mursili then left for Babylon and sacked it, but was assassinated upon his return to his capital Hattusa, and his empire disintegrated. Halab was rebuilt and the kingdom expanded to include Alalakh again. The reestablished kingdom was ruled by kings of whom nothing but their names is known the first is Sarra El, who might have been the son of Yarim Lim III. The last king of the dynasty to rule as king of Halab was Ilim Ilimma I, whose reign ended c. 1524 when he was killed during a rebellion orchestrated by king Parshatatar of Mitanni who annexed Halab. Ilim Ilimma's son, Idrimi, fled to Emar then conquered Alalakh c. 1517 BC. Seven years following his conquest of Alalakh, Idrimi made peace with Mitanni and was acknowledged as a vassal, and allowed to control Halab, though he had to relocate the dynasty's residence to Alalakh and relinquish the title of King of Halab the use of the name Yamhad also ended. Dates are estimated and given by the Middle chronology. The people of Yamhad were Amorites and spoke the Amorite language, and apart from a few Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Aegean influences, Yamhad belonged mainly to middle Bronze Age Syrian culture. This culture influenced the architecture and the functions of the temples, which were mainly cultic, while political authority was invested in the royal palace, in contrast to the important political role of the temples in Mesopotamia. Since the capital Halab has not been excavated, the architecture of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes on the walls of the palaces in Alalakh. Yamhad had a distinctive Syrian iconography, which is clear in the seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and limited to the ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather as merely a substitute for the cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim Lim I. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they constituted a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names. Halab's location has always been a factor in its prominence as an economic center. Yamhad's economy was based on trade with the Iranian Plateau, Mesopotamia, Cyprus and Anatolia, with the city of Emar as its port on the Euphrates, and Alalakh with its proximity to the sea as its port on the Mediterranean. The actions of Yarim Lim I and his alliance with Babylon proved vital for the kingdom's economy, for they secured the trade between Mesopotamia and northern Syria, with the king of Mari protecting the caravans crossing from the Persian Gulf to Anatolia. Emar attracted many Babylonian merchants, who lived in the city and had a lasting impact on the local scribal conventions. As late as the 14th century BC, texts of the so called Syrian type from Emar preserve distinct Babylonian traits. The markets of Yamhad became a source of copper, which was imported from the mountains probably Anatolian and Cyprus. However, the Babylonian invasion of Mari had a negative impact on the trade between the two kingdoms, as the road became dangerous because of the loss of Mari's protection to the caravans. This led the Babylonian king Samsu iluna to build many strongholds up the river valley, and to establish colonies of mercenaries known as the Kassite Houses to protect the middle Euphrates area. Those colonies later evolved into semi independent polities that waged a war against the Babylonian king Ammi Saduqa and caused the trade temporarily to stop. The people of Yamhad practiced the Amorite religion, and mainly worshiped the Northwest Semitic deities. The most important of these were Dagon, who was considered the father of the gods, and Hadad, who was the most important deity and the head of the pantheon. The kingdom was known as the land of Hadad , who was famous as the Storm God of Halab beginning in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. His main temple was located on the citadel hill in the center of the city and remained in use from the 24th century BC, until at least the 9th century BC. The title Beloved of Hadad was one of the king's titles. Hadad was the kingdom's patron god, and all treaties were concluded in his name, which was also used to threaten other kingdoms, and to declare wars. As the Hurrian presence grew, so did Hurrian religious influences and some of the Hurrian deities found a place in the Yamhadite pantheon. King Abba El I mentioned receiving the support of the Hurrian goddess Hebat in one of the Alalakh tablets Hebat was the spouse of the Hurrian main deity Teshub, but in Abba El I's tablet, she is associated with Hadad . Later, the Hurrians started to identify Teshub with Hadad, who became Teshub the Storm God of Halab. Beside the general gods, the kings had a head god , that is, a deity who had an intimate connection for the worshiper. King Yarim Lim I described Hadad as the god of the state, but the Mesopotamian deity Sin as the god of his head. His son Hammurabi I did likewise.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamhad
"Yamsay Mountain is a large shield volcano in the Cascade Range of south central Oregon, located about 35 miles 56 km east of Crater Lake on the border between Klamath County and Lake County. It is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc but is located in a mountain range 30 to 50 miles 50 to 80 km behind the main Cascade volcanic front. The best known members of this enigmatic arc are the massive shields of Newberry Volcano, about 55 miles 89 km farther north in Oregon, and Medicine Lake Volcano, about 80 miles 130 km south in Northern California. Yamsay is the highest volcano in the eastern arc, almost 300 feet 90 m higher than Newberry and Medicine Lake. A central part of Klamath mythology, the mountain offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers. Until the 1970s, a fire lookout tower sat on the summit of the mountain, and its foundation remains to this day. Like other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Yamsay was produced by subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Annual convergence between the two continues at a rate of 1.6 inches 4 cm per year. The Cascades make up the majority of the North American West Coast volcanoes they have been volcanically active for about 36 million years. The rock making up the Cascades is slightly older, dated between 55 and 42 million years old. In an attempt to organize the volcanoes by age, scientists typically divide them into two provinces the High Cascades the younger volcanoes and the Western Cascades, comprising the older volcanoes. Yamsay, along with the Simcoe volcanic complex, Medicine Lake Highlands, and Newberry Volcano, make up a wayward range of shield volcanoes between 50 kilometres 31 mi and 60 kilometres 37 mi east of the main Cascade Range. Volcanism at these centers is unlike other eruptions in the Cascades, and it does not stem from fissures as would Basin and Range volcanism. The volcanoes appear to be isolated from the major volcanic ranges in the Northwestern United States, although scientists group them as part of the Cascades. Recent volcanism in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite based material up to 50 percent . On the eastern side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake. The name Yamsay is a corruption of the Klamath a Native American tribe of Southern Oregon name Yamsi, a form of Yamash, meaning north wind. This mountain was supposed to be the home of Kmukamtch, the supreme being of Klamath mythology. Historically, the area by the mountain was inhabited by Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin Bands, all of the Snake Paiute people. The Yahooskins lived east of Yamsay Mountain, near modern day Lakeview. Their group inhabited 22 million acres 89,000 km2 of land in Oregon and California. Traders entered the area at some point between 1825 and 1827, where they worked as trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company. After routes opened up in 1846, Fort Klamath was built in 1863 . The city of Klamath Falls southwest of Yamsay sprang up in the 1920s and featured the fastest growing population in Oregon. Contributors to this new growth and development included the creation of the Southern Pacific Railroad, completed in 1909. This opened the area for logging and timber business, which became the focus of the profit of the area. The mountain features a United States Forest Service fire lookout tower with an 80 foot 24 m steel tower, built on the summit of Yamsay in 1929. It was removed after the 1970s, and only remnants of the foundation remain today. A dirt road was built to the summit to service the lookout, but this was abandoned after the tower was removed. The upper 3.5 miles 5.6 km now form a hiking trail to the summit. The Cascade Range is dramatically different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral plants such as beargrass and bitterbrush prevail. Diverse life exists within the range, including endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals in the area consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both endemic species. The Fremont National Recreation Trail passes through the area. It offers tourists excellent views of other Oregon Cascades landmarks, such as Mount Bachelor, Mount Shasta, the Three Sisters, and Mount Thielsen. Other activities along the trail include hiking and horseback riding up the mountain from the recreation area located at an elevation between 6,500 and 8,196 feet 1,981 and 2,498 m .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamsay%20Mountain

She started out performing covers of songs, but due to positive reception online, she was persuaded to make original songs as well. For the single Ambivalentidea , she wanted to incorporate Jormungand's theme of contradiction in the song. To accomplish this, she included figurative and abstract words in the song's lyrics. The song's title comes from the words ambivalent and idea, which when put together were intended to express the idea of a contradiction of visualization.

In an interview with Entertainment Station, Yanagi discussed her role as music producer of the anime series Just Because , and the making of the series' opening theme Over and Over . It was the first time that she served as a music producer for an anime series, so she would discuss ideas with anime staff. As Just Because is set in a high school, she set out to write music that would fit scenes, deciding when instruments such as the piano or guitar would be used depending on the scene. She used picture stories as references in making the soundtrack she also used high school baseball cheering songs as references in writing a track for scenes involving baseball. The intro of Over and Over was influenced by two of her earlier songs Yukitoki and Harumodoki , which were both used in My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected. For the song, she wanted to incorporate the series plot point of transferring schools she aimed for the song to have a happy feeling, but she took time finding a way to express it.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagi%20Yanagi
"Gennady Ivanovich Yanayev Russian 26 August 1937 24 September 2010 was a Soviet politician who served as the first and only Vice President of the Soviet Union. Yanayev's political career spanned the rules of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko, and culminated during the Gorbachev years. Yanayev was born in Perevoz, Gorky Oblast. After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as Chairman of the All Union Central Council of Trade Unions, but he also held other lesser posts such as deputy of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Due to his chairmanship of the All Union Central Council of Trade Unions he gained a seat in the 28th Politburo and Secretary of the Central Committee. Later that year, on December 27, with the help of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yanayev was elected the first, and only, Vice President of the Soviet Union. Having growing doubts about where Gorbachev's reforms were leading, Yanayev started working with, and eventually formally leading, the Gang of Eight, the group which deposed Gorbachev during the August coup of 1991. After three days, the coup collapsed, in part due to western backing of Boris Yeltsin, but during its brief grip of power Yanayev was made Acting President of the Soviet Union. He was then arrested for his role in the coup, but in 1994 he was pardoned by the State Duma. He spent the rest of his life working in the Russian tourism administration until his death on 24 September 2010. Yanayev was born on 26 August 1937 in the town of Perevoz, Gorky Oblast during the height of Stalinist repression in the Soviet Union. He graduated from the Gorky Institute of Agriculture in 1959. After graduation he worked as the head of a mechanised agricultural unit and later as a chief engineer in the Gorky Oblast. He applied and officially became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU in 1962. From 1963 to 1968, he held the positions of second, and subsequently first, secretary of the Gorky Komsomol, and later became Chairman of the Committee of Youth Organisations, which he held for 12 years. From 1980 to 1986 he was Deputy Chairman of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. He became Secretary for International Affairs of All Union Central Council of Trade Unions in 1986 and became Deputy Chairman of the trade unions in 1989. In April 1990 he was elected Chairman of the All Union Central Council of Trade Unions. As chairman of the trade unions, he was not able to quell the growing labour discontent in the country, but his position granted him a seat in the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU at the 28th CPSU Congress held in 1990 , alongside his election as Secretary of the Central Committee. On 27 December 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev proposed Yanayev as Vice President of the Soviet Union. He was Gorbachev's third choice for the post Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had turned the offer down. Yanayev had initially been rejected by the Supreme Soviet, but he was finally approved due to Gorbachev's insistence, only days after Shevardnadze had resigned from office due to Gorbachev's willingness to give leeway to conservatives. Some weeks after Yanayev's election, a senior Soviet official described Yanayev as Gorbachev's Quaylea conservative nonentity, no threat to Gorbachev, and his selection would pacify the right wing . At the beginning of January 1991, Yanayev headed a committee working on the formation of a new cabinet. Later, he was sent to the Soviet city of Kuznetsk to negotiate with a newly formed independent trade union, making this the first time since 1917 that a Russian government official had negotiated with a trade union. However, after gaining the attention of the Soviet government, the unionists withdrew their plans for a strike. Shortly after taking office, Yanayev joined a group of more conservative Communist politicians who hoped to persuade Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency, led by KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov. After Gorbachev announced his proposal for a New Union Treaty to form the Union of Sovereign States, as a reorganisation of the Soviet Union into a new confederation, he went on vacation to his dacha in the Crimea. Believing that this new Union treaty would lead to the disintegration of the USSR, the State Committee of the State of Emergency placed Gorbachev under house arrest on 19 August, one day before the treaty was due to be signed. On that same day the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union TASS issued the coup plotters' decree, which stated Owing to the conditions of his health, Mikhail Gorbachev is no longer capable of carrying on the duties of the President of the USSR. In accordance with article 127, clause 7 of the USSR constitution, Vice President Gennady Yanayev has assumed the duties of the President of the USSR. The decree made references to the growing problems facing the country such as ethnic tensions, political confrontations and chaos, which according to the coup leaders threatened the very existence of Soviet life and the territorial integrity of the USSR. Yanayev further claimed that the danger of collapse was imminent, and if the economic situation was not handled quickly, the Soviet Union would collapse. In addition, Yanayev and the rest of the state committee ordered the Cabinet of Ministers to alter the then current five year plan to relieve the housing shortage. All city dwellers were given one third of an acre each to combat winter food shortages by growing fruit and vegetables. When asked about Gorbachev, Yanayev replied Let me say that Mikhail Gorbachev is now on vacation. He is undergoing treatment, himself, in our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better. At a press conference Yanayev's hands were shaking rather violently, leading many journalists to focus on Yanayev's apparent drunkenness instead of Gorbachev's allegedly bad health. On 19 August, citizens of Moscow gathered around Russia's White House and began to erect barricades around it, in which at 16 00 Yanayev responded by declaring a state of emergency in Moscow. Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17 00 that Gorbachev was resting . He said Over these years he has become very tired and needs some time to get his health back. Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev's weak posture, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing. According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind Kryuchkov has been described as the heart and soul of the conspiracy . Yanayev only agreed to head the Emergency Committee on 20 August. Along with the other coup leaders, such as Valentin Pavlov and Boris Pugo for instance, Yanayev was dismissed as Vice President and later jailed for his crimes against the Soviet state. In 1993 Novy Vzglyad quoted Yanayev as admitting that he was drunk when he signed the decree which made him acting President, but saying that inebriation had not affected his judgment. In an interview from 2008, Yanayev said he regretted making himself acting President, further claiming that he was pressured by the more conservative members to sign the documents which declared his own presidency. He described the events of 1991 as a burden for the rest of his life. Three years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yanayev was freed by an amnesty of the Russian State Duma in 1994. He would eventually become the head of the Department of History and International Relations of the Russian International Academy of Tourism. On 20 September 2010, he fell ill and was hospitalised at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 24 September 2010. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation CPRF expressed their condolences to Yanayev's family. Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the CPRF, said of him Yanayev lived an interesting, complicated and worthy life. The CPRF officially praised him as a highly professional specialist ... a dear and trustworthy comrade . In another statement made by the CPRF, this time on their official website, they claimed If they had acted much more decisively, our unified country would have been preserved. He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery, in a ceremony attended by several prominent CPRF members. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady%20Yanayev
"USS Yancey AKA 93 LKA 93 was an Andromeda class attack cargo ship built by the Moore Dry Dock Company of Oakland, California for the United States Navy during World War II. The ship was named in honor of Yancey County, North Carolina. Yancey's keel was laid in May 1944, and the ship was launched in July, and commissioned in October. The ship operated in the Pacific during the war and was a participant in the amphibious landings at Iwo Jima in February 1945 and Okinawa in April. After Japan's surrender in August, Yancey was in Tokyo Bay during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September. The ship made voyages delivering troops for the occupation of Japan before returning to the United States in January 1946. After spending most of the next year on the east coast, Yancey was ordered back into the Pacific in November, and took part in Operation Highjump, a Navy expedition to Antarctica in January 1947 Yancey Glacier was named in the ship's honor. After spending most of the next decade in duties in the Western Pacific, Yancey was decommissioned in March 1958 and placed in reserve at Olympia, Washington. Yancey was reactivated in the aftermath of the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and recommissioned in November. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis she sailed in support of the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and during the April 1965 U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic she carried almost a quarter of all of the evacuees from Santo Domingo. In January 1970, Yancey was blown by a storm into the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel which closed the structure for several weeks. The ship was decommissioned for the final time in January 1971, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1977. After being stripped of salvageable materials, the ship was sunk as an artificial reef off the North Carolina coast in 1990. The ship is intact and rests on her starboard side at a depth of 160 feet 49 m . Yancey was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract MC hull 1193 on 22 May 1944 by the Moore Dry Dock Company at Oakland, California. The ship was launched on 8 July 1944 and was sponsored by Miss Beverly Bartlett. As built, Yancey was just over 459 feet 140 m long and 63 feet 19 m abeam. When fully loaded she had a displacement of 13,910 long tons 14,130 t and drew a little more than 26 feet 7.9 m . She was powered by a single steam turbine capable of generating 6,000 shaft horsepower 4,500 kW , and attained a top speed of 16.5 knots 30.6 km h during her trials. Yancey was equipped to carry eight LCMs Landing Craft Mechanized , which were designed to land vehicles in amphibious landings one LCP L Landing Craft, Personnel Large and fifteen LCVPs Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel , or Higgins boats. Yancey was outfitted with primarily defensive weapons one 5 in 130 mm 38 caliber dual purpose gun mount, four twin 40 millimeter 1.6 in anti aircraft AA gun mounts and sixteen 20 millimeter 0.79 in AA gun mounts. The ship was commissioned as USS Yancey AKA 93 on 11 October 1944 under the command of Commander Edward R. Rice, USNR. After fitting out at San Francisco, California, Yancey received her boat group of 26 landing craft and conducted a shakedown cruise out of San Pedro, California. After post shakedown alterations and repairs at San Diego, California, she sailed for San Francisco to load cargo from 18 to 24 November. Yancey sailed for Pearl Harbor the next day, and was assigned to Transport Division TransDiv 47, Transport Squadron TransRon 16 upon her arrival on 2 December. After remaining at Pearl Harbor until 27 January 1945, Yancey departed for the Marianas with elements and cargo of the 5th Marine Division as part of Task Group TG 51.12 in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima. After stops for fuel and supplies at Eniwetok and invasion rehearsals at Tinian, the ship arrived off Iwo Jima at 06 24 on 19 February, D day for the initial landing. During almost continuous operations for the first four days of the battle, Yancey only lost two landing craft LCVPs one to enemy mortar fire, and another to heavy surf. Yancey received minor damage when she collided with Pensacola while transferring 8 inch 200 mm ammunition to the heavy cruiser. On 29 February, after the tactical situation ashore had improved sufficiently, Yancey anchored off Red beach to unload her general cargo. During this time the ship was hit by one long range mortar shell, but suffered no casualties among her crew. Slowed by nightly air raids, and high surf that required cargo to be offloaded to LSTs, LSMs, and LCTs, Yancey completed her unloading on 2 March. The cargo ship sailed with three other transports and a pair of screening destroyers to Saipan and then to Espiritu Santo, where she rejoined her TransRon 16 squadron mates in embarking the 27th Infantry Division. Yancey sailed on 25 March as a part of TG 51.3, the designated mobile reserve for the invasion of Okinawa. As the group headed for a planned stop in the Carolines, Yancey took a disabled LSM under tow and delivered the vessel to Ulithi. TransDiv 47 was detached from TG 51.3 and arrived off Kerama Retto on 9 April, eight days after the battle had commenced. After receiving her orders, Yancey anchored off the Hagushi beaches on the 12th. During her four days of unloading, the crew was hampered by Japanese air raids and delayedaccording to the ship's commanderover 15 hours because of the attacks. Yancey's number four 40 millimetres 1.6 in mount claimed a sure assist on a Nakajima Ki 43 Oscar fighter that crashed 3,000 yards 2,700 m from the ship. Despite delays caused by the air attacks, Yancey was the first attack cargo ship of her group to finish unloading, and sailed independently for the Marianas on the 16th. During her stay off the Okinawa beaches, the ship lost none of her boats and suffered three casualties two men were wounded by shrapnel, and another broke an arm. After a short rest and recreation stop at Guam, Yancey rejoined her squadron at Ultihi and underwent boiler repairs and intensive antiaircraft training her crew won numerous five case beer prizes for shooting down target sleeves. Getting underway again on 8 May, Yancey spent the next two months shuttling men and materiel from rear area bases, calling at Manus in the Admiralty Islands Finschhafen, New Guinea Tulagi Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea and finally Guiuan, on the island of Samar, in the Philippines. She rejoined TransDiv 47, TransRon 16, at San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, on 16 July and sailed with the rest of the division to Iloilo, on the island of Panay, to conduct amphibious training exercises with the United States Army's 43rd Infantry Division. Yancey was in the Philippines when word of the Japanese surrender came in on 15 August. TransDiv 47 took on provisions at Iloilo after training exercises for the planned invasion of Japan were cancelled after arriving at Batangas, Luzon, Philippines, she embarked elements of the 1st Cavalry Division slated for the occupation of Japan. After completing the loading process on 23 August, Yancey weighed anchor on the 25th as a member of Task Force TF 33. However, the ships had to turn back because of a tropical storm in the vicinity. The typhoon delayed the task force for only a day, as the ships weathered the fringes of the storm at Subic Bay before again getting underway soon thereafter. Yancey entered Tokyo Bay on the morning of 2 September, the day Japan signed the formal articles of surrender on the deck of the battleship Missouri anchored there. Shortly after the conclusion of those ceremonies, the attack cargo ship headed into Yokohama harbor, the third ship in her squadron to enter that port and the first to start unloading. The ship completed her unloading in 19 hours and then proceeded to an anchorage off Yokohama. During her World War II service, Yancey was awarded two battle stars. Yancey's squadron departed on 4 September 1945 and steamed via Leyte Gulf to Zamboanga. There, they commenced loading elements of the Army's 41st Infantry Division from 16 to 18 September. Yancey and her sisters shifted soon thereafter to Bugo, Mindanao, where she picked up Army LCMs. After TG 54.28 had assembled in Leyte Gulf on 21 September, the groupwhich included Yanceysailed for Japan's Inland Sea. Due to minesweeping difficulties, however, the landings scheduled for the KureHiroshima area were postponed and the task group sailed instead for Buckner Bay, Okinawa. On 28 September, the ship put to sea to evade another typhoon. On 1 October, she returned and anchored in Buckner Bay. Two days later, Yancey again headed for Japanese waters and entered Bungo Suido on the 5th, beginning the long, difficult passage up the Inland Sea along the channel swept through the minefields. The next morningafter spending the night anchored in the cleared channelYancey headed for Hiro Wan, where the landings were made. The ship completed her unloading in 48 hours. On 9 October, she was detached from TransRon 16 and reported to CinCPac for assignment. The following day, Yancey rode out a third typhoon with 130 fathoms 240 m of chain on deck, a second anchor ready to go, and steam at the throttle. The attack cargo ship, remaining behind when the rest of her squadron was sent back to the United States on 11 October, headed instead to Haiphong, French Indochina to embark Chinese troops. After an 11 day delay, 1,027 officers and men of the 471st Regiment, 62nd Chinese Armyand one interpreterboarded the American vessel for passage to Takao, Formosa. After arrival, the Chinese troops had all been offloaded by 17 00 on 17 November. After sailing to Manila, Yancey received orders to proceed to the United States on 25 November, one year to the day she had sailed from San Francisco. Yancey took on a capacity load of Army and Navy men returning to the United States for discharge and departed Manila harbor on 27 November. During the voyage, she flew a 310 foot 94 m homeward bound pennant adorned with 27 stars. After a stop at Pearl Harbor for boiler repairs and to offload her Army passengers, Yancey sailed for Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, reaching there on the last day of the year she was the last ship to transit the Panama Canal in 1945. On 6 January 1946, Yancey cleared Cristobal, Canal Zone, bound for Louisiana. After a brief stop at New Orleans, the attack cargo ship proceeded on, via Jacksonville, Florida, to Norfolk, where she arrived on 29 January. Less than a month later, on 27 February, Yancey sailed farther north and reached the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the following day. Over the next few months, Yancey underwent a regular overhaul there and then operated off the eastern seaboard and into the western Atlantic. During that time, she called at Bayonne, New Jersey Bermuda San Juan, Puerto Rico Guantanamo Bay, Cuba Balboa, Canal Zone Jacksonville, Florida and made return calls at Norfolk, Bayonne, and Bermuda. In addition, the ship visited the New York Naval Shipyard and Davisville, Rhode Island, before being assigned tentatively to TF 68 effective on 9 November. In compliance with her new orders, Yancey proceeded back to the west coast, sailing via Cristobal and the Panama Canal. After arriving at San Pedro, California, Yancey reported for duty with TF 68 and was reassigned to the Pacific Fleets Service Force and homeported at San Francisco, on 11 November. The next day, she shifted to Port Hueneme, California, where she began loading cargo for Operation Highjump, the U.S. Navy expedition to Antarctica. Departing Port Hueneme on 2 December, Yancey pressed southward, headed for Antarctica, and spent Christmas at sea. Two days later, she saw her first icebergsvisible evidence that she was entering the polar latitudes. She sighted the northern limit of the Antarctic pack ice on the 28th and spent the next two days investigating ice conditions. She fueled from USS Canisteo 10 nautical miles 19 km south of Scott Island, Antarctica, purportedly becoming the first ship to conduct an underway refueling below the Antarctic Circle. After threading her way through the pack ice over the ensuing weeks, Yancey finally arrived at Bay of Whales, Antarctica, mooring at the shelf ice on 18 January 1947. Subsequently departing that port on 6 February for the area to the north of the ice floes, the attack cargo ship entered the pack ice on the 9th. Over the next three days, she pressed through the floes that extended for a width of almost 275 nautical miles 509 km . On 13 February, Yancey joined TU 68.1.2 which also included the Coast Guard icebreaker, Northwind, towing the attack cargo ship Merrick. Within a week, the ships were riding out a fierce storm that justifiedat least to Yancey sailorsthe Antarctic's title as The World's Stormiest Sea . Yancey reached Port Chalmers, New Zealand, on 22 February and departed that port on 5 March, bound for Samoa. Subsequently departing Pago Pago on 27 March bound for Hawaii with YTL 153 in tow, the attack cargo ship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 14 April. She soon got underway for the west coast of the United States and reached Port Hueneme on 2 May 1947. There, Yancey disembarked a unit of a construction battalion Seabees and discharged TF 68 cargo. Her duty with TF 68 thus completed on 15 May, Yancey reported for duty with Service Division ServDiv 12. Shortly thereafter, Yancey shifted to San Pedro before heading to Terminal Island, California, for restricted availability on 20 May. After that period of repairs and alterations, Yancey returned to Port Hueneme to load cargo earmarked for shipment to Pearl Harbor and Guam. Over the next decade, Yancey operated between west coast ports and advanced bases in the Western Pacific WestPac , including ports in Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. During that period, she also supported United Nations UN actions in Korea, operating in support of the initial attempts to fight the North Korean advance in the first UN counteroffensives in early 1951 and in the final phases of activity that preceded the armistice in the summer of 1953. Yancey was awarded three battle stars for her Korean War service. In December 1957, after having served continuously since 1944, Yancey was deactivated at San Francisco. She was placed out of commission in March 1958, and entered the Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington, on 11 October 1960. In the aftermath of the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Yancey was reactivated as part of President John F. Kennedy's bid to build up the U.S. Navy. On 17 November 1961, Yancey was recommissioned at Portland, Oregon, with Captain Gordon R. Keating in command. The ship departed from San Diego on 12 January 1962 and reached Norfolk, her new assigned home port, on 2 February, there becoming the newest member of Amphibious Squadron PhibRon 12. Over the next months, Yancey took part in a variety of exercises and maneuvers. Yancey participated in Operation Phiblex in the spring of 1962, operating off Roosevelt Roads and Vieques, Puerto Rico. She later paid a port call at Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, before she returned to Roosevelt Roads and reloaded equipment and embarked Marines slated to return to Morehead City, North Carolina. Subsequently returning to Norfolk on 2 May, Yancey touched briefly at Charleston, South Carolina, to take on additional landing craft before returning to the Tidewater region to spend the remainder of May. Subsequently visiting Boston, and Rockland, Maine, Yancey participated in amphibious boat exercises at Provincetown, Massachusetts, before she got underway on 24 July for Davisville, Rhode Island. There, she loaded a Seabee unit and their equipment and headed eastward, bound for Rota, Spain. Offloading one Seabee unit and onloading another, Yancey then paused briefly at Gibraltar before touching at Lisbon on the return leg of her voyage to the United States. Disembarking the seabees and unloading their equipment at Davisville, Yancey headed back to Norfolk, reaching her homeport on 18 August 1962. On 17 October, Yancey again sailed from Norfolk and proceeded to Morehead City, to load marines and equipment for Operation PhiBrigLex Amphibious Brigade Exercises slated for Vieques, Puerto Rico. Upon arrival, the attack cargo ship loaded immediately and set out to join the rest of the ships in the squadron. She soon was fighting her way through Hurricane Ella which caused her to alter her course to avoid the most severe part of the storm. On 23 October 1962, President Kennedy ordered a naval quarantine of Cuba in response to the presence of Soviet missiles on the soil of that island nation. Yancey sortied in support of the American operations in the Caribbean, and remained on station until the missiles were removed and tensions were relaxed. Over the next few years, Yancey made regular deployments to the Mediterranean to take part in joint exercises with NATO forces. In April 1965, Yancey was ordered to the Dominican Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' intervention in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order and several large families. Yancey's officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey in honor of the ship. After debarking her passengers at San Juan on 1 May, the ship took on supplies needed by the American ground forces in Santo Domingo gasoline, oil, and ammunition. She docked in Santo Domingo on 2 May and exchanged her cargo for 450 more evacuees to be taken to San Juan. In all, Yancey carried almost a quarter of those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role of training and cruising off the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA 93. Toward the end of her career, Yancey made headlines. Yancey was at anchor near one stretch of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel near Norfolk on 21 January 1970. Driven by the winds in a snowy gale that gusted up to 50 miles per hour 80 km h , Yancey dragged her anchors and hit the bridge, knocking it out of service for several weeks. The Navy started a free shuttle service for commuters that normally used the route, using helicopters and LCUs. Fortunately, there were no vehicles on the bridge at the time of the collision, and no one was injured. Sources do not report on any damage to Yancey from the incident, but any damages suffered must have been easily repaired, because the ship deployed to the Mediterranean a few months later. After a return to the United States in mid 1970, Yancey entered inactive status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she was withdrawn to be stripped of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was withdrawn for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef. In 1990, the former Yancey was sunk as an artificial reef off Morehead City, North Carolina, and rests on her starboard side at a depth of 160 feet 49 m .

"William Lowndes Yancey August 10, 1814 July 27, 1863 was a journalist, politician, orator, diplomat and an American leader of the Southern secession movement. A member of the group known as the Fire Eaters, Yancey was one of the most effective agitators for secession and rhetorical defenders of slavery. An early critic of John C. Calhoun and nullification, by the late 1830s Yancey began to identify with Calhoun and the struggle against the forces of the anti slavery movement. In 1849, Yancey was a firm supporter of Calhoun's Southern Address and an adamant opponent of the Compromise of 1850. Throughout the 1850s, Yancey, sometimes referred to as the Orator of Secession , demonstrated the ability to hold large audiences under his spell for hours at a time. At the 1860 Democratic National Convention, Yancey, a leading opponent of Stephen A. Douglas and the concept of popular sovereignty, was instrumental in splitting the party into Northern and Southern factions. At the 1860 convention, he used the phrase squatter sovereignty in a speech he gave to describe popular sovereignty. During the American Civil War, Yancey was appointed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to head a diplomatic delegation to Europe in the attempt to secure formal recognition of Southern independence. In these efforts, Yancey was unsuccessful and frustrated. Upon his return to America in 1862, Yancey was elected to the Confederate States Senate, where he was a frequent critic of the Davis Administration. Suffering from ill health for much of his life, Yancey died during the Civil War, in July 1863 at the age of 48. Yancey's mother, Caroline Bird, lived on the family home nicknamed the Aviary located near the falls of the Ogeechee River in Warren County, Georgia. On December 8, 1808, she married Benjamin Cudworth Yancey, a lawyer in South Carolina who had served on the USS Constellation during the Quasi War with France. William Lowndes Yancey was born on August 10, 1814, at a plantation, known as the Aviary , near the western border of Warren County, Georgia. Three years later, on October 26, 1817, his father died of yellow fever. Yancey's widowed mother married the Reverend Nathan Sydney Smith Beman on April 23, 1821. Beman had temporarily relocated to South Carolina to operate Mt. Zion Academy, where William was a student. In the spring of 1823, the entire family moved when Reverend Beman took a position at the First Presbyterian Church in Troy, New York. Beman worked with Reverend Charles G. Finney in the New School movement and in the 1830s became involved with abolitionism through contacts with Theodore Dwight Ward and Lyman Beecher. Beman's marriage was marred by domestic unrest and spousal abuse that led to serious considerations of divorce and finally a permanent separation in 1835. This atmosphere affected the children and caused William to reject many of his step father's teachings. Yancey's biographer, historian Eric H. Walther, speculates the character of Yancey's later career was a result of low self esteem and a search for public adulation and approval that went back to his childhood experiences with Reverend Beman. In the fall of 1830, Yancey was enrolled at Williams College in northwestern Massachusetts. The 16 year old Yancey was admitted as a sophomore based on the required entrance examinations. At Williams, he participated in the debating society and for a short time was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps as a politician by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay at Williams academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, six weeks before graduation. Yancey returned to the South, relocating to Greenville, South Carolina. He originally lived on his uncle's plantation, where he served as a bookkeeper. The uncle, Robert Cunningham, was a strong unionist, as were most of Yancey's family, including his birth father. On July 4, 1834, at a Fourth of July celebration, Yancey made a stirring nationalistic address in which he openly attacked the radicals of the state who were still talking secession from the repercussions of the Nullification Crisis Listen, not then, my countrymen, to the voice which whispers for as yet, it does not raise itself above a whisper that Americans, who have been knit together by so many cords of affection, can no longer be mutual worshippers at the Shrine of Freedomno longer can exist together, citizens of the same Republic ... As a result of Yancey's political activities, he was appointed editor of the Greenville South Carolina Mountaineer in November 1834. As editor, he attacked both nullification and the chief architect of nullification, John C. Calhoun. Yancey compared Calhoun to Aaron Burr and referred to them as two fallen arch angelswho have made efforts to tear down the battlements and safeguards of our country, that they might rule, the Demons of the Storm. Yancey resigned from the newspaper on May 14, 1835. On August 13, married Sarah Caroline Earl. As his dowry, Yancey received 35 slaves and a quick entry into the planter class. In the winter of 18361837, Yancey removed to her plantation in Alabama, near Cahaba Dallas County . It was an inopportune time to relocate. As a result of the Panic of 1837, Yancey's financial position was seriously damaged by cotton prices that fell from fifteen cents a pound in 1835 to as low as five cents a pound in 1837. In early 1838, Yancey took over the Cahaba Southern Democrat, and his first editorial was a strong defense of slavery. From his current economic perspective, Yancey began to identify the anti slavery movement negatively with issues such as the establishment of a national bank, internal improvements, and expanding federal power. As the former nationalist moved to a states' rights position, Yancey also changed his attitude toward Calhounapplauding Calhoun's role in the Gag rule Debates. Yancey also began to attack Henry Clay for his support of the American Colonization Society, which Yancey equated with attacks on Southern slavery. Yancey, like most members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a personal code of honor. In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. Yancey was confronted by another relative and his wife's uncle , Dr. Robinson Earle. Conversation turned to violence, and the always armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. Yancey was tried and sentenced to a year in jail for manslaughter. An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, Reared with the spirit of a man in my bosomand taught to preserve inviolate my honormy character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated. Yancey returned to his paper in March 1839, but sold it a couple of months later when he moved to Wetumpka in Elmore County, Alabama. While his intent was to resume his life as a planter, Yancey suffered a huge financial reversal when his slaves were poisoned as a result of a feud between Yancey's overseer and a neighboring overseer. Two of the enslaved were killed, and most of the others were incapacitated for months. Unable to afford replacements and burdened with other debts from his newspaper, Yancey was forced to sell most of the people as they recovered. Yancey did open in Wetumpka the Argus and Commercial Advertiser. Yancey was increasingly interested in politics as his personal politics moved towards the most radical wing of the Southern Democratic Party. Influenced most by Dixon Hall Lewis, Yancey fell into a social and political circle that included political leaders of the state such as Thomas Mays, J. L. M. Curry, John A. Campbell, and John Gill Shorter. In April 1840, Yancey started a weekly campaign newsletter that supported Democrat Martin Van Buren over Whig William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election while emphasizing that slavery should now be the most important political and economic concern of the South. While still not a secessionist, Yancey was also no longer an unconditional unionist. He was elected in 1841 to the Alabama House of Representatives, in which he served for one year. In March 1842, Yancey sold his newspaper because of increasing debt throughout his career as an editor he faced the problem of many fellow editorsobtaining and collecting on subscriptions , and he opened a law practice instead. In 1843, he ran for the Alabama Senate and was elected by a vote of 1,115 to 1,025. His special concern in this election was the effort being made by Whigs to determine apportionment in the state legislature based on the federal ratio of each slave counting as three fifths of a person. Currently only whites were counted and the change would benefit the Whigs who generally were the largest slaveholders. This division between large slaveholders and yeomen Alabamians would continue through the Alabama secession convention in 1861. In 1844, Yancey was elected to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy winning with a 2,197 to 2,137 vote and re elected in 1845 receiving over 4,000 votes as the Whigs did not even field a candidate . In Congress, his political ability and unusual oratorical gifts at once gained recognition. Yancey delivered his first speech on January 6, 1845, when he was selected by the Democrats to respond to a speech by Thomas Clingman, a Whig from North Carolina, who had opposed Texas annexation. Clingman was offended by the tone of Yancey's speech and afterwards Yancey refused to clarify that he had not intended to impugn Clingman's honor. Clingman challenged Yancey to a duel, and he accepted. The exchange of pistol fire occurred in nearby Beltsville, Maryland neither combatant was injured. In Congress, Yancey was an effective spokesman in opposing internal improvements and tariffs and supporting states' rights and the start of the MexicanAmerican War. More and more, he subscribed to conspiracy theories regarding Northern intentions while helping to provide ammunition for those Northerners who were starting to believe in a slaveholders' conspiracy. In 1846, however, he resigned his seat, partly for financial reasons, and partly because of his disgust with the Northern Democrats, whom he accused of sacrificing their principles for economic interests. Within a few months of his resignation, Yancey moved to Montgomery, where he purchased a 20 acre 81,000 m2 dairy farm while establishing a law partnership with John A. Elmore. No longer a planter, Yancey still remained a slaveholder, owning 11 slaves in 1850, 14 by 1852, and 24 between 1858 and 1860. While he had suggested with his resignation that his active role in politics might be over, perhaps forever , Yancey found this to be impossible. Yancey recognized the significance of the Wilmot Proviso to the South and in 1847, as the first talk of slaveholder Zachary Taylor as a presidential candidate surfaced, Yancey saw him as a possibility for bringing together a Southern political movement that would cross party lines. Yancey made it clear that his support for Taylor was conditional upon Taylor denouncing the Wilmot Proviso. However, Taylor announced that he would seek the Whig nomination, and in December 1847 Lewis Cass of Michigan, the leading Democratic candidate, endorsed the policy of Popular sovereignty. With no available candidate sufficiently opposed to the Proviso, in 1848 Yancey secured the adoption by the state Democratic convention of the Alabama Platform, which was endorsed by the legislatures of Alabama and Georgia and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia. The platform declared When the national convention was held in Baltimore, Cass was nominated on the fourth ballot. Yancey's proposal that the convention adopt the main points of the Alabama Platform was rejected by a 21636 vote. Yancey and one other Alabama delegate left the convention in protest, and Yancey's efforts to stir up a third party movement in the state failed. The opening salvo in a new level of sectional conflict occurred on December 13, 1848, when Whig John G. Palfrey of Massachusetts introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. Throughout 1849 in the South the rhetoric of resistance to the North escalated and spread . Calhoun delivered his famous Southern Address , but only 48 out of 121 Congressmen signed off on it. Yancey persuaded a June 1849 state Democratic Party meeting to endorse Calhoun's address and was instrumental in calling for the Nashville Convention scheduled for June 1850. Yancey was opposed to both the Compromise of 1850 and the disappointing results of the Nashville Convention. The latter, rather than making a strong stand for secession as Yancey had hoped, simply advocated extending the Missouri Compromise Line to the Pacific Coast. Yancey helped create Southern Rights Associations a concept that originated in South Carolina in Alabama to pursue a secessionist agenda. A convention held in February 1851 of these Alabama associations produced Yancey's radical Address to the People of Alabama . The address began The legacy of the old party organization had been to lead their members to avoid any decisive action on the great slavery question, and to wink and acquiesce in aggressions on the South rather than endanger party success by opposition to them. The address hit all of the main points that would ultimately resurface in the secession during the winter of 18601861, especially the treatment of Southerners ...as inferiors in the Unionas degraded by your contact with slaves, and as unworthy of an association with the Northern man in the great work of extending the institution of slavery over the vast plains of the West. Despite the efforts of Yancey, the popularity of the Compromise of 1850, the failure of the Nashville Convention, and the acceptance of the more moderate Georgia Platform by much of the South, led to unionist victories in Alabama and most of the South. Yancey's third party support for George Troup of Georgia on a Southern rights platform drew only 2,000 votes. Yancey continued to support the most radical Southern positions and is generally included as one of a group of southerners referred to as Fire Eaters. Historian Emory Thomas notes that Yancey, along with Edmund Ruffin and Robert Barnwell Rhett, remained in the secessionist forefront longest and loudest. Thomas characterized the whole fire eater cause as reactionary in purpose the preservation of the South as it then existed , but revolutionary in means the rejection of the existing political order . When the conflicts in Kansas Territory known as Bleeding Kansas erupted in 18551856, Yancey spoke publicly in support of Jefferson Buford's efforts to raise 300 men to go to Kansas and fight for Southern interests. In 1856, Yancey was head of the platform committee for the state Democratic and AntiKnow Nothing Convention, and he succeeded in having the convention readopt the Alabama Platform. In June 1856, he participated in a rally condemning Charles Sumner while praising his assailant Preston Brooks, who nearly bludgeoned Sumner to death in the United States Senate Chamber. In June 1857, Yancey spoke at a rally opposing Robert J. Walker's actions as territorial governor of Kansas. In July 1856 he spoke at the University of Alabama's graduation on the distinctive characteristics of the Northern and Southern people of the Union. In January 1858, he participated in a rally supporting William Walker, the famous Nicaragua filibuster, calling the Central American enterprise as the cause of the South. Throughout the mid 1850s, he also lectured on behalf of the Mount Vernon Ladies Association of the Union, an organization that eventually purchased and restored Mount Vernon from John A. Washington in 1858. Yancey helped to raise 75,000 for this project. Editor and fellow fire eater James DeBow was a leader in establishing the Southern Commercial Conventions in the 1850s. At the 1857 meeting in Knoxville, DeBow had called for a reopening of the international slave trade. At the May 1858 convention in Montgomery, responding to a speech by Virginian Roger A. Pryor opposing the slave trade, Yancey, in an address that spanned several days, made the following points If slavery is right per se, if it is right to raise slaves for sale, does it not appear that it is right to import them Let us then wipe from our statute book this mark of Cain which our enemies have placed there. We want negroes cheap, and we want a sufficiency of them, so as to supply the cotton demand of the whole world. Yancey supported a plan originated by Edmund Ruffin for the creation of a League of United Southerners as an alternative to the national political parties. In a June 16, 1858 letter to his friend James S. Slaughter that was publicly circulated Horace Greeley referred to it as The Scarlet Letter , Yancey wrote No National Party can save us no Sectional Party can do it. But if we could do as our fathers did, organize Committees of Safety all over the cotton states and it is only in them that we can hope of any effective movement we shall fire the Southern heartinstruct the Southern mindgive courage to each other, and at the proper moment, by one organized, concerted action, we can precipitate the cotton states into a revolution. Yancey was ill for much of the remainder of 1858 and early 1859. For the 1859 Southern Commercial Convention in Vicksburg, which passed the resolution to repeal all state and federal regulations banning the slave trade, Yancey could only contribute editorials, although by July 1859 he was able to speak publicly in Columbia, South Carolina, in favor of repealing the restrictions. When the Alabama Democratic Party organized in the winter of 18591860 for the upcoming national convention, they chose Yancey to lead them on the basis of the Alabama Platform. Both Stephen A. Douglas and popular sovereignty were the immediate targets, but by then Yancey also recognized that secession would be necessary if a Black Republican were to gain the White House. After twelve years' absence from the national conventions of the Democratic Party, Yancey attended the Charleston convention in April 1860. The Douglas faction refused to accept a platform, modeled after Yancey's Alabama Platform of 1848, committed to protecting slavery in the territories. When the platform committee presented such a proposal to the convention, it was voted down on the floor by a 165138 vote. Yancey and the Alabama delegation left the hall and were followed by the delegates of Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, and two of the three delegates from Delaware. On the next day, the Georgia delegation and a majority of the Arkansas delegation withdrew. As Eric Walther states, Through his years of preparation and despite some brief wavering, William L. Yancey had finally destroyed the Democratic Party. Failing to nominate a candidate, the convention adjourned and reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, 1860. In a last gasp effort to obtain party unity, Douglas supporter George N. Sanders made an unauthorized offer to Yancey to run as vice president. Yancey turned this down, and the entire Yancey delegation from Alabama was refused credentials in favor of a proDouglas slate headed by John Forsyth. With the South Carolina delegation also being denied credentials, the Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee delegations left the convention. The Southern representatives reconvened in Baltimore on June 23 and adopted the Yancey platform from the Charleston convention and nominated John C. Breckinridge for president. In a speech before the convention, Yancey characterized the Douglas supporters as ostrich liketheir head was in the sand of squatter sovereignty, and they did not know their great, ugly, ragged abolition body was exposed . Yancey, who had already made thirty public addresses in 1860, delivered twenty more during the campaign. If he had not been before, he was certainly now a national figurea figure making it clear that secession would follow anything other than a Breckinridge election. Yancey's speaking tour in favor of Breckinridge was not confined to the South. In Wilmington, Delaware, Yancey stated, We stand upon the dark platform of southern slavery, and all we ask is to be allowed to keep it to ourselves. Let us do that, and we will not let the negro insult you by coming here and marrying your daughters. On October 10, 1860, at Cooper Institute Hall in New York Yancey advised Northerners interested in preserving the Union to Enlarge your jails and penitentiaries, re enforce and strengthen your police force, and keep the irrepressible conflict fellows from stealing our negroes... Yancey cited southern fears that with abolitionists in power, Emissaries will percolate between master slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with strychnine to put in our wells. He further warned the crowd that Republican agitation would make Southern whites the enemies of that race until we drench our fields with the blood of the unfortunate people. At Faneuil Hall in Boston, Yancey defended the practices of slavery You are allowed to whip your children we are allowed to whip our negroes . There is no cruelty in the practice. ... Our negroes are but children. ... The negro that will not work is made to work. Society tolerates no drones. From Boston, Yancey's tour included stops in Albany, Syracuse, Florence Kentucky , Louisville, Nashville, and New Orleans, finally returning to Montgomery on November 5. When news of Lincoln's election reached the city, Yancey rhetorically asked a public assemblage protesting the results, Shall we remain and all be slaves Shall we wait to bear our share of the common dishonor God forbid On February 24, 1860, the Alabama legislature passed a joint resolution requiring the governor to call for the election of delegates to a state convention if a Republican was elected president. After first waiting for the official electoral votes to be counted, Governor Andrew Moore called for the election of delegates to take place on December 24 with the convention to meet on January 7, 1861. When the convention convened, Yancey was the guiding spirit. The delegates were split between those insisting on immediate secession versus those who would secede only in cooperation with other Southern states. A frustrated Yancey lashed out at those cooperationists The misguided, deluded, wicked men in our midst, if any such there be, who shall oppose it , will be in alignment with the abolition power of the Federal government, and as our safety demands, must be looked upon and dealt with as public enemies. Eventually, the ordinance of secession was passed over cooperationists objections by a vote of 6139. When the newly established Confederate States of America met later that month in Montgomery to establish their formal union, Yancey was not a delegate, but he delivered the address of welcome to Jefferson Davis, selected as provisional President, on his arrival at Montgomery. While many of the fire eaters were opposed to the selection of a relative moderate like Davis, Yancey accepted him as a good choice. In his speech, Yancey indicated that in the selection of Davis, The man and the hour have met. We now hope that prosperity, honor, and victory await his administration. Many historians agree with Emory Thomas who wrote, When Yancey and Davis met in Montgomery the helm of the revolution changed hands. Yancey and the radicals had stirred the waters Davis and the moderates would sail the ship. Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Yancey met on February 18, 1861, as Davis was starting to put together the executive branch of the government. Yancey turned down a cabinet position, but indicated he would be interested in a diplomatic post. Don Doyle argues that Davis displayed tone deafness in appointing Yancey, who was ignorant of the world and himself realized that he was wholly unsuited by experience and personality for diplomacy. However, Davis feared that Yancey would be a political opponent, and wanted him out of the country. On March 16, Yancey was formally appointed as the head of the diplomatic mission to England and France. Ambrose Dudley Mann and Pierre Adolphe Rost were also part of the mission only Mann had any diplomatic experience. The delegation assembled in London at the end of April. Confederate Secretary of State Toombs' official instructions to Yancey were to convince Europe of the righteousness and legality of southern secession, the viability of the militarily strong Confederacy, the value of cotton and virtually duty free trade, and the South's willingness to observe all treaty agreements in effect between Britain and the United States except for the portion of the Webster Ashburton Treaty requiring aid in combating the African slave trade. Above all, Yancey was to strive for diplomatic recognition. Hubbard argues that President Davis could not have selected three less qualified Southern leaders . In contrast to Walther's favorable characterizations of Yancey's conduct, Hubbard stated that Yancey's conduct in England was consistently impulsive, arrogant, unreasonably demanding . Arriving in Britain just a few days ahead of the news about the attack on Fort Sumter, Yancey and his delegation met informally with British foreign secretary Lord John Russell on May 3 and May 9. Yancey emphasized the points from his instructions and denied, upon being questioned by Russell, that there was any intent to reopen the slave trade. Russell was non committal, and on May 12, Queen Victoria announced British neutrality combined with recognition that a state of belligerency existed. After news arrived of the Confederate victory at Bull Run, Yancey attempted to arrange another meeting with Russell, but he was forced to present his arguments in writing. Doyle argues that Yancey blundered badly by extolling the benefits of slavery to the world in general and Britain in particular. In an August 24 response directed to the representatives of the so styled Confederate States of America , Russell merely reiterated the previous determination to remain neutral. Critics maintain that the Yancey mission failed to adequately exploit openings presented by Union Secretary of State William Seward's antagonist attitude towards Great Britain or to address British concerns concerning the effect of the war on Great Britain. In late August, with little else to do, Yancey submitted his resignation but, due to the events of the Trent Affair, Yancey did not leave until his replacements, James M. Mason and John Slidell selected by President Davis in July before he was aware of Yancey's intent , arrived in January 1862. Yancey did make one further attempt to meet with Russell in the wake of the Trent affair, but Russell replied to the delegation that we must decline to enter into any official communication with them. While Yancey was originally optimistic about his mission, his observations in conversations and in the British papers forced him to conclude that the slavery issue was the primary obstacle to formal diplomatic recognition. He told his brother Anti slavery sentiment is universal. Uncle Tom's Cabin has been read and believed....I ought never to have come here. This kind of thing does not suit me. I do not understand these people or their ways well enough. While still in England, Yancey was elected to the Confederate Senate. His return home, because of the Union blockade, found him landing at the Sabine Pass near the Texas and Louisiana border. On his way to Richmond, he stopped in New Orleans where he made a public speech lamenting the fact that Europe looked down on the Confederacy over the issue of slavery, stating, We cannot look for any sympathy or help from abroad. We must rely on ourselves alone. From March 28, 1862 until May 1, 1863, Yancey served in three sessions of the Confederate Congress. While there, he reluctantly supported the Confederate Conscription Act of April 16, 1862, but was instrumental in allowing many state exemptions to the draft as well as the unpopular exemption for one overseer for every twenty slaves, an exemption that applied to about 30,000 men. He unsuccessfully argued against the excessive use of secret, unrecorded sessions of Congress and generally pursued a states' rights position in regard to the exercise of national war powers in general and impressment of supplies and slaves by the federal Confederate government in particular. On military matters, Yancey wanted details provided to Congress on reports of execution without trials of Confederate soldiers by General Braxton Bragg, questioned the reasons Virginia had twenty nine brigadier generals while Alabama only had four, authored a resolution condemning drunkenness within the army, and joined in demands that Davis account for complaints on the military administration of the Trans Mississippi District. Yancey gradually ran afoul of President Davis on matters of policy, although he was not one of Davis's most extreme critics. Their differences accelerated in a series of letters exchanged after May 1863, and no final resolution was reached. In Congress, Yancey and Benjamin Hill of Georgia, who had previously clashed in 1856, had their differences over a bill intended to create the Confederate Supreme Court erupt into physical violence. Hill hit Yancey in the head with a glass inkstand, knocking Yancey over a desk, and onto the floor of the Senate. The physical attack on Yancey by Hill within the Confederate Congress was kept secret for months, and in the ensuing investigation it was Yancey, not Hill, who was censured. Yancey returned to Alabama in May 1863, before Congress had adjourned. By the end of June, Yancey was extremely ill from his injures received during the attack by Hill in the Confederate Congress, but he still continued his correspondence with President Davis and others. Finally on July 27, 1863, two weeks before his forty ninth birthday, Yancey died of kidney disease. Yancey's funeral on July 29, 1863, brought the city of Montgomery to a standstill, and he was buried at Oakwood cemetery on Goat Hill near the original Confederate Capitol. The William Lowndes Yancey Law Office in Montgomery, Alabama, was designated a National Historic Landmark of the United States in 1973. Due to unauthorized interior renovations, it was later de designated, but it remains listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Lowndes%20Yancey

Yang earlier in the series got engaged to Preston Burke Isaiah Washington , in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced Owen Hunt Kevin McKidd . Oh originally auditioned for the role of Miranda Bailey, although Chandra Wilson was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considering her friendship with Meredith to be the secret core of Grey's . Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive, and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, E Online reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member. Cristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from Smith College and a fellow surgical intern to Meredith Grey Ellen Pompeo , Izzie Stevens Katherine Heigl , George O'Malley T.R. Knight , and Alex Karev Justin Chambers the five of them working under Miranda Bailey Chandra Wilson . An atheistic competitive intern of Korean American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also has dyslexia, and was raised in Beverly Hills, California by her mother and supportive Jewish stepfather. She has a B.A. from Smith College, an MD from Stanford University and a Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley, making her a double doctor . While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat robot , Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's person , sharing the same dark and twisty sense of humor. During her internship, Cristina has an on off relationship with the chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke Isaiah Washington that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an ectopic pregnancy and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst fallopian tube while in the O.R. Burke and Yang resume their relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. Burke gets shot after a shooting at the hospital and needs surgery. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by forming a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to Richard Webber James Pickens Jr. , the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he views as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. When the wedding day comes, Yang has a moment of panic before she is about to walk down the aisle but Burke leaves her because he wasnt sure if she was ready to commit. Burke then disappears and isnt seen again until later in the series. Yang then proceeds to go on her honeymoon to Hawaii with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital. Burke is replaced by Erica Hahn Brooke Smith , who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, Callie Torres Sara Ramirez moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio due to a dispute with Torres . Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals and Burke wins the Harper Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is unbearable and that she has turned into a ghost. Yang meets Owen Hunt Kevin McKidd , an army trauma surgeon when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle outside the hospital. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. Owen Hunt is later honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of trauma surgery and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with Derek Shepherd Patrick Dempsey , despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in Iraq and PTSD which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and even attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life threatening cancer, Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism. Hunt hires ex colleague from the Army, Teddy Altman Kim Raver , to become the chief of cardiothoracic surgery as a gift for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is deeply hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. After being shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widower who commits mass murder at the hospital, Cristina operates on Derek at gunpoint, thus saving his life. The shooter injures Hunt as well when he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Hunt and Yang impulsively decide to get married. Yang suffers from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone, making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's. Due to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally, and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton Scott Foley , Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on. Yang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counseling. Hunt has a one night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins Jessica Capshaw , Mark Sloan Eric Dane , and Lexie Grey Chyler Leigh are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, has brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas William Daniels . She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker Steven Culp who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle. Cristina is re hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive 15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres Sara Ramirez , and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't. After breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgment. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina kisses Shane. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful, and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3 D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family. Cristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper Avery Foundation that co owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by Preston Burke who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids. Cristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board. At the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her co workers she has come to know and love including Owen and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland. On the creation of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained a little bit of personality . Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with. Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding Thank God I did not get that part , explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say. The character of Yang was not originally supposed to be of Asian descent. Oh said her character was a pert little blonde and the thing is the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big difference. In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for Grey's Anatomy, Oh said The American Broadcasting Company ABC characterized Yang as competitive , ambitious , and intelligent , while also noting her weaknesses bossy , aggressive , and tactless . Oh said of her character I've always tried to play Cristina with a tremendous amount of focus and ambitionwhich is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are at the very top of their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive. James Pickens Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring. Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the portmanteau Burktina , citing Losing My Religion as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the second season to its end. Rhimes commented, her struggle to suppress all of her humanity in pursuit of perfection. And in my mind, what we realize is that she is not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can't hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable. Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as sisterhood , and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as her person . This led to the two being dubbed the twisted sisters . At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a honeymoon together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. New York magazine wrote of the character There's probably no woman on TV right now more single mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established that she would have an abortion in this circumstance. Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because that was so much more interesting, story wise . As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have would have been hideous. made sense for the character. Discussing his onscreen relationship with Yang, McKidd said It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet. On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting. Oh said of Yang's expressions of emotions during season eight You see her express her emotions with only two people her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you have to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season. Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon. The character was well received by the critics at the time of its inception and as the series went on the reviews became increasingly positive and Cristina went on the become an iconic character not just for Grey's but for television itself. Kelli Catana of The Huffington Post named Yang the best damn character of the series. Yang appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters, with the website commenting that she is an engaging yet comedic factor for the prime time soap Grey's Anatomy. Philadelphia Magazine included Yang in its list of the 10 Best Doctors on Television . However, the same periodical listed her as one of The 12 Most Annoying Women on TV . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considers her friendship with Meredith to be the secret core of Grey's and perhaps creator Shonda Rhimes' greatest contribution to prime time. The Huffington Post's writer Kelli Catana agreed, saying the Meredith Yang relationship is probably the most true friendship on network television. Their friendship was listed in AOL TV's Top 20 TV's Best BFFs and in Entertainment Weekly's 30 Best TV Bromances Gal Pals . Yahoo Voices also put Yang on their list of The Most Loyal TV Best Friends of All Time . Television Without Pity writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is the only one of these five that regularly acts like an actual doctor . Yang's relationship with Burke was positively received it was considered as one of the most interesting relationships on the show . Similarly, The Orange County Register wrote that their romance became one of the most touching and funny attractions of Grey's Anatomy. Christopher Monfette of IGN was critical of their wedding planning in the third season, saying The will they's and won't they's fly and fall like hobbled pigeons until the season finale when the show solves both its personal and professional problems in the most obvious and least compelling of ways. UGO.com placed their break up on its list of the most horrible TV breakups. In 2009, Monfette said of Yang's relationship with Owen Hunt's interactions with Cristina were perfectly balanced for optimum drama, never together and never apart for so long that the back and forth became frustrating. Viewers could clearly see a softening of the typically hard edged Cristina, a pleasant change for what had become something of a one note character. Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly also praised the pairing, especially in Elevator Love Letter , saying As good as they've been at amping up the romance crackling between Owen and Cristina, Kevin McKidd and Sandra Oh brought the Emmy consideration tonight from scene 1. She also added I loved seeing Cristina at least try to stand by her man. Of Yang and Owen's wedding, Armstrong said Glad we made a clean disposal of the Teddy Owen Cristina love triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, I heard there's a guy, and she said she was happy for him. She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an A . Later, she praised their marriage, saying I am absolutely loving the stronger than ever lady bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now Just growing up Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I can't get enough. New York Magazine praised the abortion storyline, saying that the show was brave enough to do what almost no other series will show this one particular, totally legal medical procedure on TV and that the abortion was the only plausible resolution for Yang's pregnancy. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair It alternately seems silly and not silly, when you really think about it. Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Yang's storylines in the eighth season, saying Their stories are effectively tied into that of a patient whose ability to move forward is complicated by a complex response to a hideous past. HitFix writer Liane Bonin Starr applauded Yang's brief departure from Seattle Grace to Mayo Clinic in the ninth season, which was interesting as it showed us a new side of herand after so many seasons, that was some welcome insight. The relation between Meredith and Cristina has been acclaimed and been a highlight of the show. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the friendship to be the secret core of Grey's . Aisha Harris of Slate called their relation The Best Female Friendship on TV adding that With those two characters, showrunner Shonda Rhimes and her team of writers created one of the most nuanced and realistic portrayals of female friendship on television. Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly called Cristina and Meredith the best female friends on TV because they don't try to be . There's nothing fake about them, which is a rarity in how female friends are portrayed on television. She further went on to call them 'soulmates', And even though they'd never dare get sappy enough to say it, they're soul mates. Margaret Lyons of Vulture magazine called the friendship dream BFF relationship. and the primary focus of the show, One of the series' calling cards has been its depiction of female friendship and particularly the primacy that friendship enjoyed over romantic relationships. E at the time of Sandra Oh's exit wrote, In Grey's Anatomy's 10 year history, the doctor duo has been through a lot together weddings, deaths, plane crashes, bomb threats, shooting, you name it, they've lived and danced through it. and added, And with the three words, You're my person. Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey solidified their status as the small screen's best best friends ever. Oh has received numerous awards and nominations for her portrayal of Yang. In 2005, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, which she was nominated for every year until 2009. Also in 2005, she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 10th Satellite Awards.

"Yang Shoujing Chinese pinyin Yang Shoujing WadeGiles Yang Shou ching 1839 9 January 1915 was a late Qing dynasty historical geographer, calligrapher, antiquarian, bibliophile, and diplomat. He is best known for the historical atlas Lidai yudi tu, commonly called the Yangtu Yang's atlas , the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. He devoted most of his life to the annotation of the 6th century geographic work Shui jing zhu, which was completed by his disciple Xiong Huizhen and published as the Shui jing zhu shu. As a Qing diplomat posted in Japan, Yang purchased tens of thousands of ancient Chinese books from Japanese libraries and archives, many of which had become rare or lost in China. After his death, the government of the Republic of China purchased his collection and preserved most of the books in the National Palace Museum. Yang was an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School and became highly influential in Japan. The introduction of his art was said to have offered virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style to Japan and revolutionized Japanese calligraphy. Yang's former residence and tomb in Yidu, Hubei are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China. Yang was born in 1839, during the Qing dynasty, in Lucheng Town, Yidu County, Hubei Province. His courtesy name was Xingwu . After passing the provincial examination and earning the juren degree in 1862 first year of the Tongzhi reign , he lived for ten years in Beijing trying to pass the imperial examination for the highest jinshi degree, without success. Although he failed the examinations, he became friends with the prominent officials Pan Zuyin and Zhang Zhidong, who shared his passion for antiques. He attended Pan's lavish parties and shopped for antiques in Beijing's Liulichang with Zhang. From a young age Yang was interested in geography, and spent much of his life annotating Li Daoyuan's 6th century work Commentary on the Water Classic Shui Jing Zhu . His knowledge in geography earned him a diplomatic post to Japan, despite his repeated examination failure. In Tokyo he worked under the career diplomat Li Shuchang, an abrasive superior who nevertheless appreciated Yang's knowledge in antiques. As Japan was quickly westernizing during the Meiji Restoration, traditional Chinese publications fell out of fashion and were sold cheaply. Working with Li as well as Japanese antiquarians, Yang purchased tens of thousands of old Chinese books preserved in Japanese collections, many of which had become rare or even lost in China. They were later published as Guyi congshu . After Yang's death, the Republic of China government purchased his collection and preserved most of his books in the National Palace Museum. Yang was posted in Japan from 1880 to 1884. After returning to China, he taught at the Lianghu Academy in Wuchang and then became dean of the Qincheng School , later renamed as Cungu School . In 1909 he served as an advisory official of the Ministry of Rites. He died in Beijing on 9 January 1915, and was buried in his hometown Yidu. Yang devoted most of his lifetime to the annotation of the Commentary on the Water Classic Shui jing zhu . He wrote 40 volumes of annotation but died before completing the work. His disciple Xiong Huizhen carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes of annotation. It was published in the 1950s as the Shui jing zhu shu . The influential historian Gu Jiegang remarked that the work brought to a point of culmination the textual research of The Classic of Waterways of the previous three centuries. He greatly admired the authors' single minded devotion to the task, and Xiong's devotion to his master. Another of Yang's important works is the Lidai yudi tu , his historical atlas of China which is often simply called the Yangtu Yang's atlas . Yang began the work in 1866 with the assistance of Deng Yongxiu, and was joined by Rao Dunzhi in the late 1870s. They plotted historical geographical data on a Qing dynasty map, but left out non Han Chinese kingdoms such as Nanzhao and Dali. Published between 1906 and 1911, it was the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. Based on Yang's atlas, historian Tan Qixiang compiled The Historical Atlas of China, which was published in the 1980s and is considered the most authoritative atlas of Chinese history ever published. With the encouragement of Pan Zuyin, Yang became an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School of Chinese calligraphy. When he went to Japan, he introduced the style to Japanese calligraphers, offering them virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style and revolutionizing Japanese calligraphy. He was considered a talented artist by famous Japanese calligraphers such as Miyajima Seiichiro, Kusakabe Meikaku, Iwaya Osamu, and Matsuda Sekka. Iwaya Osamu and others bought hundreds of sheets of Yang's works. Yang wrote many essays on the Stele School of calligraphy, which were published by Japanese scholars in two volumes, Ping bei ji , Record of stelae criticism and Ping tie ji , Record of model letters criticism . In September 1986, the government of Yidu city repaired Yang Shoujing's tomb and former residence, which was turned into the Yang Shoujing Museum. His residence and tomb are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China designation 6 995 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%20Shoujing
"Yangwei Chinese pinyin Yangwei WadeGiles Yang wei literally 'Show of Force' was a cruiser built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was built by Charles Mitchell Company in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, from a design by Sir George Wightwick Rendel which had already been used on the Chilean Navy vessel Arturo Prat later the Imperial Japanese Navy's Tsukushi . Two ships were ordered by the Chinese, the Yangwei and the Chaoyong. Both would serve together throughout their careers, assigned to the Beiyang Fleet and based in Taku during the summer, and Chemulpo, Korea, in the winter. Yangwei did not see any action during the Sino French War, but in the First Sino Japanese War, she was in the Chinese line at the Battle of Yalu River on 17 September 1894. She was set alight by combined fire from the Japanese fleet, and drifted south out of the battle until running aground on a reef. She was subsequently destroyed by a spar torpedo from a boat of the Japanese cruiser Chiyoda. The design for Yangwei was advertised by its designer, British naval architect Sir George Wightwick Rendel, as an example of a low cost cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships. Yangwei's basic design was initially used on the Chilean Navy vessel Arturo Prat, which preceded it in construction, although several changes were made, including increasing the number of steam boilers from four to six. Both Yangwei and her sister ship, the Chaoyong shared the same design, and were built by British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell on the River Tyne near Newcastle Upon Tyne. Mitchell had worked alongside Rendel, and was building Arturo Prat. Yangwei measured 220 feet 67 m long overall, with a beam of 32 ft 9.8 m and an average draft of 15.5 ft 4.7 m . The ships were manned by 140 crew. The most significant difference between the two ships was the power output of their reciprocating engines while Yangwei had an output of 2,580 indicated horsepower 1,920 kilowatts , Chaoyong's engine supplied 2,677 ihp 1,996 kW . This meant that while Yangwei could achieve a speed of 16 knots 30 km h 18 mph , the Chaoyong could go faster at 16.8 kn 31.1 km h 19.3 mph . They both were constructed out of 0.75 inches 1.9 cm steel with waterproof bulkhead 3.5 ft 1.1 m below the waterline, a single smokestack, and twin masts, which could also be used for sails. The prow was reinforced for ramming. They had a number of technical innovations, including hydraulic steering systems and electrical incandescent light fixtures. The main armaments were breech loading Armstrong Whitworth 254 mm 10.0 in cannons, one on the bow and one on the stern, mounted in stationary gun shields. These shields were added for weather proofing reasons, but restricted the angle of fire that could be taken, as well as the elevation they could fire at. Yangwei also had four 5.1 inches 130 mm inch guns, two to each side , two 57 mm 2.2 in long guns, four 11 mm 0.43 in Gatling guns, four 37 mm 1.5 in Hotchkiss guns, two 4 barrelled Nordenfeldt guns, as well as two torpedo tubes. Both ships were equipped with two pinnaces, which were each armed with spar torpedoes. Chinese diplomat Li Hongzhang was made aware of Rendel's designs, and following the start of the construction on Arturo Prat, an order was placed on behalf of the Imperial Chinese Navy for two ships of the same type. Yangwei was laid down on 15 January 1880, and launched on 29 January 1881. Yangwei was subsequently worked up, and was announced as completed on 14 July that year. They were completed ahead of Arturo Prat, who instead would enter service as the Imperial Japanese Navy's Tsukushi after Chile cancelled the order following the end of the War of the Pacific. Each of the Chinese vessels were equipped with Chinese crews, with Western captains and instructors in place. They sailed out of the Tyne River on 9 August, and stopped in Plymouth Sound two days later where Admiral Ding Ruchang joined them to take command of the ships for the journey to China. Following their arrival on 20 October in Hong Kong, they toured Canton now Guangzhou and Shanghai, before travelling to the Taku Forts. Chaoyong was boarded by Hongzhang, and the two cruisers took the diplomat to inspect the dredging of the port at Taku now the Port of Tianjin . Both ships were assigned to the Beiyang Fleet in the north, and Ruchang was placed in command. On 23 June 1884, Yangwei was present alongside Chaoyong, as well as the corvette Yangwu and the sloop Kangji, when the Chinese vessels met their French Navy counterparts. The French ships dwarfed their Chinese counterparts, and following a discussion between the leaders of each fleet, the French put on a firing demonstration. Afterwards, the Chinese fleet broke up with Yang Wu headed to Foochow now Fuzhou , and the two cruisers sailed back to Taku. The Sino French War broke out shortly afterwards, although Yangwei saw no action, there was speculation that the two cruisers might be sent to break the French blockade of Formosa. She and Chaoyong were sent south to Shanghai in November, but were then brought back north after concerns were raised about growing Japanese influences in Korea. Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei continued to operate together. They operated out of Taku, but since the water froze over during winter, they would spend that part of the year in the Korean port of Chemulpo now Incheon . During the First Sino Japanese War in 1894, Yangwei remained with the fleet and was supporting troop transports when they made contact with a Japanese fleet on the morning of 17 September. As the Japanese fleet moved in, the Chinese fleet moved away from anchor and attempted for form up in a line. However, the manoeuvre was botched and Yangwei was one of four ships which ended up behind the others. This was due to a lack of maintenance over the years with their equipment out of date they could barely make 10 kn 19 km h 12 mph . Orders had been given for the ships to operate in pairs, with Yangwei and Chaoyong teamed together. This battle plan was alien to the premise of their design, inherent in the lack of armour for ships about to fight in the line of battle. At a distance of 3,000 yd 2,700 m , the Japanese fleet targeted the Chaoyong and Yangwei. Within a few minutes, fires broke out on both ships, which quickly engulfed the central superstructures with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei fought no more, and eventually beached on a reef several miles south with the loss of the majority of her crew. The morning following the battle, she was destroyed by a spar torpedo from a boat of the Japanese cruiser Chiyoda. The Japanese fleet had kept their distance, only sending in their smaller boats to investigate, fearing a counterattack by the Chinese using torpedoes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%20cruiser%20Yangwei
"Yangwu Chinese pinyin Yangwu WadeGiles Yang wu or Yang Woo was a wooden corvette built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was built in 1872 at the Foochow Arsenal, and was the largest ship built there from the shipbuilding programme of 186875. During her early career, she was used as a training ship and under the command of English captains. She later saw action in the Battle of Fuzhou in 1884, the opening action of the Sino French War, where she acted as the flagship of the Fujian Fleet. Shortly after the start of the battle, she was damaged by a spar torpedo, causing a large explosion and the loss of the majority of her crew she was sunk shortly afterwards by enemy fire. Yangwu was a unique showpiece at the Foochow Arsenal. She was 190 feet 2 inches 57.96 m long overall, had a beam of 36 feet 11 m and an average draft of 16 feet 65 inches 6.53 m . She displaced 1,393 long tons 1,415 t . The propulsion system consisted of a 250 horsepower 190 kW steam engine, built by John Inglis and Company, equipped with four boilers and a retractable funnel. Her engines produced a cruising speed of 13 knots 24 km h 15 mph . Yangwu was armed with a battery of four 5 inch 130 mm 70 pounder guns on each side, and two further mounted as chase guns at the bow and stern. These were each built by the British firm Armstrong's. A further 6.5 inch 170 mm 150 pounder at amidships and two 24 pounder long guns rounded out her armament. She was equipped with two gunpowder magazines, located at fore and aft. Yangwu was a wooden corvette, built at the Foochow Navy Yard and launched on April 23, 1872. She was the seventh vessel built as part of a larger shipbuilding program at the Foochow Arsenal, and cost 254,000 taels 353,000 silver dollars for her construction. She was the largest warship built between 186875 out of the 19 vessels planned. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from Western nations, who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations. Chinese officials would later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for purposely providing them with out of date equipment and designs. After being launched in 1872, she served as a training vessel from 1875 in the South China Sea, making at least one journey to Japan. Yangwu was equipped with a classroom for the training of Chinese midshipmen and officers. At the time of a report in the Shanghai Courier in June 1876, there were 30 such sailors under tuition. She had been recently commanded by the Captain Tracey, an Englishman, but he had been recalled to the Royal Navy and promoted to Post captain. He was replaced with his fellow countryman, Captain Luxmore. There were two further English members of the crew, both officers, while the rest were Chinese. During the summer of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, and later in the year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu Si hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an accident occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay. On June 23, 1884, as tensions were rising between the French Empire and Imperial China, Yangwu was part of the Chinese fleet at Chefoo now known as Yantai which met with a French squadron comprising two cruisers and a sloop. During the course of the meeting, the French demonstrated the firepower of their cruisers, which were nearly two and a half times the size of Yangwu, which in turn was the largest of the Chinese vessels. During the demonstration, the French showed they could hit targets more than 4,000 metres 4,400 yd away. Afterwards, Yangwu headed to the naval yard at Foochow now Fuzhou , while the remaining Chinese ships steamed to the port of Tianjin. On August 9, 1884, French naval forces attacked and captured Keelung on the island of Formosa in response to Chinese involvement in the Tonkin Campaign and specifically the Bac Le ambush. Shortly afterwards, the French Navys Far East Squadron under Rear Admiral Amedee Courbet, comprising the cruisers Duguay Trouin, Villars, and d'Estaing along with a number of smaller vessels, was sent up the Min River to attack the arsenal at Foochow. As they travelled upriver, the Chinese declared war on the French, officially marking the start of the Sino French War. Yangwu led the Fujian Fleet protecting Foochow under the command of Captain Chang Cheng, which otherwise comprised three sloops in addition to a variety of gunboats, transports, launches and war junks. The Royal Navy and United States Navy vessels in the port made certain to anchor a distance away from where the engagement was expected to take place. The vessels faced off for several days before the French forces made their attack, as they were awaiting reinforcement by the ironclad Triomphante. They planned to attack just before 2pm on August 23, with two torpedo boats tasked with engaging Yangwu and the gunboat Fusheng on the first signal. Just prior to 2pm on August 23, the attack began after a broadside from the gunboat Zhenwei at the French gunboat Lynx. This was the signal for the small boats to move forward, and some 27 seconds later a massive explosion erupted from Yangwu. Boat No. 46 had impacted with her spar torpedo just below the waterline amidships. The detonation was so large that only fifteen of the crew survived and it was claimed that bodies launched into the air were found on the rooftops of houses over 1 mile 1.6 km away, although this was later considered to be an outlandish claim. The number of survivors was likewise questioned by eyewitnesses on board the screw sloop USS Enterprise, as the official report claimed that the senior officers survived whereas the witnesses suggested that the only possible survivors would have been those who threw themselves into the river prior to the explosion. A report appeared following the battle of an interview with Mr. Yung, who claimed to have survived the Yangwu explosion having been stationed at the stern of the vessel. He explained that the ship had returned fire to the French cruiser Volta before being hit by the spar torpedo, and orders were given to continue firing after the explosion. Fire from Hotchkiss guns on French vessels made this difficult. But, despite this Yangwu disabled the other torpedo boat. The Captain handed Yung a flotation device and decided that the junior crew member should jump first, with the Captain following. As he swam away, Yung saw the Captain helping an engineer who had suffered severe burns but shortly afterwards the fore gunpowder magazine detonated, destroying the rest of the ship. The wreck of Yangwu drifted as the French fired on her as she caught fire and sank. The victory of the French forces at Foochow was decisive, with losses estimated either at six or 12 personnel with 27 missing. The Chinese losses were far greater, at 521 killed, 150 wounded and a large number missing after the battle. The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships headed back down the river, destroying any forts they encountered on the way.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%20corvette%20Yangwu
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the fourth album by Chicago based rock band Wilco. The album was completed in 2001, but Reprise Records, a Warner Music Group label, refused to release it. Wilco acquired the rights to the album when they subsequently left the label. On September 18, 2001, Wilco streamed the entire album for free on their website. Wilco signed with Nonesuch Records another Warner label in November of that year, and the album was officially released on April 23, 2002. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was acclaimed by music critics, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. It is also Wilco's best selling work, having reached number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart. It is the band's first album with drummer Glenn Kotche, and last with multi instrumentalist and songwriter Jay Bennett. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it 493 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Wilco was touring to promote Mermaid Avenue Vol. II in May 2000 when Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at the Noise Pop festival in Chicago. The festival promoter offered to pair Tweedy with a collaborator of his choosing, and Tweedy decided to perform with Jim O'Rourke. Tweedy frequently played O'Rourke's album Bad Timing in his car while he traveled during the previous winter. O'Rourke was an accomplished producer as well as a musician, and had produced over 200 albums by the time that Tweedy requested the collaboration. O'Rourke offered the services of drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio performed at Double Door for the festival on May 14, 2000. Tweedy enjoyed the performance so much that he suggested that the trio record an album together. They chose the name Loose Fur, and recorded six songs during the following summer. By the end of the year, Wilco had recorded enough demo tracks to release a fourth studio album the working title was Here Comes Everybody , but the band was unhappy with some of the takes of the songs. This was attributed to the inflexibility of Ken Coomer's drumming. According to American Songwriter Magazine, Virtually every attempt the singer made to steer Coomer toward the percussive sound he had envisioned for the record sparked a fight. The band decided to bring Glenn Kotche into the studio to record with the band. Wilco officially replaced Coomer with Kotche in January 2001, a decision originally proposed by Tweedy and almost immediately approved by the rest of the band. Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett recorded the entire album with Chris Brickley, and agreed with Tweedy that O'Rourke would be a good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt by Bennett and Brickley to mix a few of the songs at CRC and after hearing O'Rourke's audition mix . One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart A Film About Wilco, was over the ten second transition between Ashes of American Flags and Heavy Metal Drummer . Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issuesa tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co wrote the material. In order to achieve the band's musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O'Rourke into the studio to mix I Am Trying to Break Your Heart sample helpinfo , and the results impressed the band members. O'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album. The cover of the album is a picture of Marina City in the band's adopted hometown of Chicago. The album was named after a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that Tweedy had heard on the Irdial box set The Conet Project Recordings of Shortwave Numbers Stations. On the fourth track of the album, a woman repeats the words Yankee Hotel Foxtrot numerous times a clip from this Numbers Station transmission was placed in the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot song Poor Places . Irdial sued Wilco for copyright infringement, and a settlement was reached out of court. After the album's completion, Tweedy decided to remove Bennett from the band. The album was completed in 2001, and Tweedy believed it to be ready for release. Los Angeles photographer Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about producing a documentary film about the creation of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for I Am Trying to Break Your Heart named after the opening song of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot beginning on the day that Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews. In 2001, AOL merged with Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's market share of the music industry had dropped almost five percent from the mid 1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A R representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, was able to negotiate a buy out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep the rights to the album if they paid Reprise 50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described what had happened. Wilco had planned on releasing Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy did not want a change in record labels to significantly delay the release of the album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album. Both independent and major record labels bid for the right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he wanted to be able to put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was commercially released by Nonesuch Records on April 23, 2002. The album sold 55,573 copies during its first week of release, peaking on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 13. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 590,000 units. The More Like the Moon EP also called Bridge and Australian EP was originally released as a bonus disc to the Australian version of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The EP comprised six songs that were recorded but not released during the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sessions including a re working of Kamera . On the one year anniversary of the release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco uploaded the EP onto their official website, and offered it for free to anyone who purchased the album. The band would later allow anyone to download the EP for free off the website, regardless of whether they had purchased the full length album. The album received widespread acclaim upon release, including positive reviews from media outlets such as Rolling Stone and BBC Music. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz Jop critics poll. Brent Sirota of Pitchfork gave the album a perfect 10 rating, noting that the album was simply a masterpiece. David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised its resemblance to psychedelia while Allmusic writer Zac Johnson lauded its musical complexity . There are more favorable reviews E Online gave the album an A and said that its rich, exotic flavor gets more intense the longer you chew on it. Stylus Magazine called it a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start. Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it a fierce record . Almost Cool gave it a score of 8.75 out of ten and said, I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group or a little of both , but this disc is so multi layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen. Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it a more adventurous and rewarding release . The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that After a while a familiarity period if you will it becomes clear that these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant. Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it The most worth the wait long awaited album in the world ... ever Could be ... Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, The most common description of this much discussed album over the past few months is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that. Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo fi. Q likewise gave it four stars and called it battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts and that it at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating. Yahoo Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke. Shortly after its online release, Peter Buck of R.E.M. acclaimed the album as their best yet. Trouser Press was one of the few major media outlets that did not give the album a good review, instead giving it an average review and stating that more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded material more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album. Robert Christgau gave the album a one star honorable mention rating, describing the music as purty but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general to be boring. Though Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was recorded before the September 11, 2001 attacks, critics perceived references in the album to the attacks. For example, Jeff Gordinier of Entertainment Weekly compared the two towers of Marina City to the World Trade Center towers. Also containing similar themes are the songs War on War and Ashes of American Flags which contains the line I would like to salute the ashes of American flags. The song Jesus, Etc. also contains these lyrics Tall buildings shake, Voices escape singing sad sad songs ... Voices whine, Skyscrapers are scraping together, your voice is smoking. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot topped the Pazz and Jop critics' poll for 2002. In 2008, Rolling Stone critic Tom Moon listed Yankee Hotel Foxtrot among the 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot found a place on many lists of the greatest albums of the 2000s. Rolling Stone ranked the album at number three on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade. Pitchfork put the album at number four on the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. The alternative music website also named Poor Places and Jesus, Etc. as the 147th and 61st best songs of the decade, respectively. Paste named the album the second best album of the decade. In 2006, readers of Q Magazine voted it the 100th Greatest Album Ever . All lyrics are written by Jeff Tweedy all music is composed by Tweedy with Jay Bennett, except tracks 1, 7 and 11 by Tweedy.

"The YankeesRed Sox rivalry is a Major League Baseball MLB rivalry between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. The two teams have competed in MLB's American League AL for over 100 seasons and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in American sports. In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86 year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the Curse of the Bambino , which was one of the most well known aspects of the rivalry. The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States. Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had featured one or both of the AL East rivals since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series ALCS three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003 while the Red Sox won in 2004. The two teams have also met once in the AL Division Series ALDS , in 2018, with Boston winning 3 1, a series which included a 16 1 Red Sox win in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, the most lopsided postseason loss for the Yankees in their history. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 when the Red Sox, then known as the Americans, won and 1949 when the Yankees won . The Yankees and the Red Sox finished tied for first in 1978 subsequently, the Yankees won a high profile tie breaker game for the division title. The first place tie came after the Red Sox had a 14 game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 ALCS, the Yankees ultimately lost a best of 7 series after leading 30. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 03 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series, ending the 86 year old curse. This match up is regarded by some sports journalists as the greatest rivalry in sports. Games between the two teams often generate considerable interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. National carriers of Major League Baseball coverage, including Fox FS1, ESPN, and MLB Network carry most of the games in the rivalry across the nation, regardless of team standings or playoff implications. YankeesRed Sox games are some of the most watched MLB games each season. Outside of baseball, the rivalry has led to violence between fans, along with attention from politicians and other athletes. Since before the start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared a rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and economic power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston. In the 19th century, however, New York's economic power outpaced Boston's, fueled by possession of the terminus of the Erie Canal, which spurred massive growth in the manufacturing, shipping, insurance and financial services businesses. Another factor was its more rapid population expansion in comparison to that of Boston, driven by the growth of these industries, by New York's popularity as an immigration port of entry, and enhanced by a larger population base, even prior to the construction of the Canal on the eve of the Revolution, New York, with 30,000 people, had nearly twice the population of Boston, with about 16,000. By the start of the 20th century the original dynamic, centered on Boston, had completely shifted as New York, particularly Wall Street, became the focus of American capitalism. The cities even played two different versions of early baseball. The Massachusetts Game, as it was called, was played on a field with four bases and with home plate in the middle whereas, the New York Game, popularized by the New York Knickerbocker Club, was played on a diamond with three bases. The New York Game spread throughout the nation after the American Civil War and became the foundation for the modern game of basesball. The Red Sox were one of the most successful teams in baseball from 1901 to 1918. They won the inaugural World Series in 1903 as the Boston Americans the team changed its name to Red Sox in 1908 and four more between 1912 and 1918. In 1901, the Yankees, then known as the Baltimore Orioles, played in Maryland for two seasons before moving north. The two teams had their first meeting in Baltimore on April 26, 1901, the inaugural year of the American League. On May 7, 1903, both teams played for the first time after the franchise moved to New York and became the Highlanders, in reference to playing games in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The game was marked by a fight when Boston pitcher George Winter was knocked down. Boston would eventually go on to win the pennant and the inaugural 1903 World Series. The 1904 season featured the teams facing each other on opening day. Later in the season, the Highlanders, led by pitcher Jack Chesbro in his record setting 41 game winning season, met the Boston Americans in the season's final game to decide the American League pennant winner. Chesbro threw a wild pitch in the top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base, and Boston won the game, and the pennant. The New York Giants, who had already clinched the National League pennant, refused to play in the 1904 World Series because of a perception of the Junior Circuit as being inferior and because of alleged animosity between American League founder and first president, Ban Johnson, and the hierarchy of the Giants, owner John T. Brush and his team's Hall of Fame coach, player manager John McGraw thus, there was no World Series that year. Not until 2004 would the Red Sox again defeat the Yankees in a title deciding game. On April 11, 1912, the Highlanders debuted their pinstripes in a game against Boston, by then known as the Red Sox. Nine days later, Boston opened Fenway Park with a game against the Highlanders, who had left their home field of Hilltop Park to play in the newly rebuilt Polo Grounds soon thereafter, in 1913, the team dropped the nickname Highlanders in favor of Yankees. Six years later, the Chicago Cubs scored two runs off of Babe Ruth in game 4 of the Series, snapping his then record World Series scoreless inning streak at 29 23 innings. The Red Sox won the game, 32, and went on to capture their fifth Series title, their third in four years, and fourth in seven years. The Yankees would however receive one notable moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917, Yankees pitcher George Mogridge threw a no hitter at Fenway Park, the first in the ballpark's history and first in Yankees history. In 1916, Harry Frazee purchased the Red Sox, on credit, for 500,000. Despite Ruth's success with the Red Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out in lieu of a larger contract and become a distraction. After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, often said to be No, No Nanette the success of that 1925 play is actually what paid off the loan . However, Ruth was sold to the Yankees in 1919, and No, No Nanette was produced by Frazee in 1925. Frazee received 125,000 and a loan of 300,000 secured on Fenway Park for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty. Ruth's arrival in New York simultaneously launched the Yankees dynasty while ravaging the Red Sox. While the Red Sox' five World Series titles were a record at the time, 1918 would be the team's last championship for 86 years. Meanwhile, Ruth's home run hitting prowess anchored the Yankees line up, which became known as Murderers' Row in the late 1920s. The Yankees reached the World Series seven times during Ruth's New York years, winning four. This abrupt reversal of fortunes for the Red Sox marked the beginning of the supposed Curse of the Bambino. But it was not the Ruth deal alone that reversed the fortunes of both clubs. Frazee also sold many other players to the Yankees. Robert W. Creamer reported that loan was made and relations between the two clubs continued to be cordial, with Frazee sending player after player to the Yankees over the next few seasons for more and more cash. This was no accident. Frazee and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert were friends, and American League president Ban Johnson's attempts to drive Frazee out of the game had caused the five teams loyal to Johnson to make no deals with the Red Sox as long as Frazee owned the club, leaving only the Yankees and White Sox as trading partners. When the White Sox' reputation was destroyed in the Black Sox Scandal, Frazee's only option for trades was to deal with the Yankees. The Red Sox soon became a baseball disaster area, finishing dead last nine times in eleven seasons. Among others, Wally Schang, Everett Scott, Carl Mays, Waite Hoyt, Joe Bush and Sam Jones went from the Sox to the Yankees in the next one to three years, along with Ed Barrow, the former Red Sox manager who became the Yankees' general manager and empire builder for the first quarter century of the Yankees' dynasty. Scott, a former Red Sox team captain, actually took the reins as Yankee captain from Ruth when he arrived and in doing so became the only player in history to be named captain for both teams. From 1920 through 2003, the Yankees won 26 World Series championships and 39 pennants, compared to only four pennants for the Red Sox. In every year that the Red Sox won the pennant1946, 1967, 1975 and 1986they lost the World Series 43, leaving them with no World Series titles. During this time, the Red Sox finished second in the standings to the Yankees on twelve occasionsin 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, 1949, 1977, 1978, and every year from 1998 to 2003. During the 84 year period, the Yankees finished with a better regular season record than the Red Sox 66 times, leading one sportswriter to quip that the Yankees' rivalry with the Red Sox was much like the rivalry between a hammer and a nail. The Yankees finished second in the standings to the Red Sox twice, in 1986 and 1995. Just two years after Ruth's sale, he went on to have a record setting season, one of the greatest in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to win their first pennant and face their cross town rival. Ruth got hurt during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series 53 to the Giants in the last ever best of nine Series. Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds, as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season. The Yankees moved across the Harlem River to the Bronx into Yankee Stadium. On April 18, 1923, the Yankees opened their new home against the Red Sox. Over 74,200 people watched the Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 41, in the first game played at the stadium. Babe Ruth hit the new stadium's first home run, christening the stadium as The House that Ruth Built. Ruth would finish the year with a .393 batting average and the Yankees won their first World Series that year. Of the 24 players on the Yankees, 11 previously played for the Red Sox. Several lesser known moments in the rivalry occurred during the 1930s. Pitcher Red Ruffing was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning six World Series. On May 30, 1938, before 83,533 spectators at Yankee Stadium, Yankees outfielder Jake Powell and Red Sox player manager Joe Cronin fought on the field and beneath the stands. Both players were fined and suspended for 10 games. The Yankees and Red Sox would finish first and second in the League respectively that year as well as the following. The Yankees went on to sweep the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series a year later. The rivalry intensified in 1941 when Ted Williams of the Red Sox batted .406, becoming the last player to bat over .400 in a season. Despite his accomplishment, Williams lost the AL MVP race to the Yankees' Joe DiMaggio, who holds the record for a hitting streak, with 56 straight games with a hit. Williams later reminisced about his rivalry with DiMaggio saying DiMaggio was the greatest all around player I ever saw. His career cannot be summed up in numbers and awards. It might sound corny, but he had a profound and lasting impact on the country. Both teams almost swapped the two players. In 1947, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail were rumored to have verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio for Williams, but MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra and the deal fell through. Joe DiMaggio's younger brother Dom would play for the Red Sox his entire career during the 1940s. The Red Sox won 15 games in a row in 1946. They were unstoppable and were in first place all but two days in the season, and would play in their first World Series game since 1918, having finished ahead of the Yankees in the American League for the first time since selling Babe Ruth. Since the Red Sox last pennant in 1918, the Yankees had won 14 pennants and 10 World Series. Boston would eventually lose the Series 43 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Former Yankees manager Joe McCarthy came out of retirement after a feud with Yankees ownership to sign with the Red Sox as their manager in 1948. Both the Yankees and the Red Sox were involved in a tight pennant race with the Cleveland Indians until the final weekend. The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant. The situation forced the first ever one game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 83 at Fenway Park and preventing the first all Boston World Series, as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series. A year later, the Red Sox entered the final series of the season at Yankee Stadium needing only one win over the Yankees to advance to the World Series. The Sox lost 53 on the last day of the season after falling 54 the previous day, resulting in the Yankees winning the AL pennant. The Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series for their 12th championship. The 1951 season opened up at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees defeated the Red Sox in public address PA announcer Bob Sheppard first game. Sheppard would go on to serve PA duties at Yankee Stadium for another 56 years. On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no hitter against the Red Sox. A year later, Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The Red Sox won 52 with Piersall sitting the game out. The Yankees won five consecutive World Series titles from 1949 to 1953, breaking their previous streak of four straight titles from 1936 to 1939. They would also go on to win 14 AL pennants in 16 years from 1949 1964. The 1961 season saw the chase of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Both Maris and Mantle would continue to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the record. On the last day of the season, Maris broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium. Former Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, Phil Rizzuto, called the shot in what was one of his first games as an announcer. The Yankees won the game 10 to win their 26th American League pennant and then to win their 19th World Series title. The next year, the Red Sox had been in the middle of a streak of eight straight losing seasons. The team was so bad, that after a 13 3 loss to the Yankees on July 26, Red Sox ace Gene Conley got off the bus and attempted to leave the country and go to Israel. Conley was denied his request because he did not have a passport. Nonetheless, Conley stayed away from the team for three days. In 1967, Red Sox pitcher Billy Rohr came within a single strike of a no hitter at Yankee Stadium. Elston Howard hit a two out, two strike single in the ninth to break the no hit bid. Rohr completed the one hitter, but ultimately finished his career with only two wins, both coming against the Yankees. Later that year, Red Sox third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam during the first game of a two game series. In the second game, Yankees pitcher Thad Tillotson threw two brushback pitches at Foy before beaning him in the batting helmet. In the next inning, Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg beaned Tillotson. Both pitchers yelled at each other, and then a brawl ensued. During the fight, Red Sox outfielder Reggie Smith picked up and body slammed Tillotson to the ground. Two months later, both teams were involved in the longest game ever played by innings at Yankee Stadium. New York recorded a 20 inning 43 victory over Boston. Earlier that year on August 3, the Yankees traded Howard to the Red Sox to help bolster their team during the pennant race. When Howard returned to Yankee Stadium in a Red Sox uniform, the Yankees fans gave him a standing ovation. Boston would be led by Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski's historic season winning the batting triple crown, leading the Red Sox to the pennant in what was a dream year for the Sox. Howard's contribution would be instrumental in the 1967 World Series, but he and Yastrzemski would lose to Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals four games to three. In 1973, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule. On April 6, opening the season at Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League history. Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant walked Blomberg in his first plate appearance of the game. Later that year at Fenway Park, with the score tied 22 in the top of the ninth, Yankees catcher Thurman Munson attempted to score from third base on a missed bunt by Gene Michael. He crashed into Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk resulting in a fight with Munson punching Fisk in the face. The rivalry intensified in the 1970s with the fans too, as just a year later in 1974 at Fenway Park, Yankees first baseman Chris Chambliss was struck in the right arm with a dart thrown from the stands after hitting an RBI ground rule double. Two years later, Yankees outfielder Lou Piniella would crash into Fisk feet first in an attempt to score in the sixth inning of a game at Yankee Stadium. The two benches cleared while Piniella and Fisk brawled at home plate. After the fight apparently died down and order appeared to be restored, Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles and center fielder Mickey Rivers began to exchange words, resulting in another fight. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder from the tilt and missed the next 51 games of the 1976 season. He would continue to pitch until 1982. The 1976 season saw the Yankees win the pennant, but lose to the Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series, just like the Red Sox had done a year prior in the 1975 World Series in which Carlton Fisk hit his famous home run off of the left field foul pole at Fenway Park. After the Yankees' loss to the Reds, owner George Steinbrenner committed to sign marquee free agent Reggie Jackson to help win a championship. The Yankees, Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles would battle each other the entire year in the division race. The Yankees would win the division for the second year in a row, while the Orioles and Red Sox finished tied for second, 2 12 games behind the Yankees. Jackson's entry onto the Yankees initially had caused a lot of friction on them. In the middle game of what would prove to be a three game series sweep by the Red Sox at Fenway Park, Yankees manager Billy Martin pulled Reggie Jackson off the field in mid inning for failing to hustle on a ball hit to the outfield. The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard from getting into a fistfight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally televised game. Eventually, emotions calmed down for the season and the Yankees came together to recapture the pennant and defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series, their first since 1962. In 1978, the Red Sox, led by Jim Rice, Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn and catcher Carlton Fisk, and managed by future Yankees coach Don Zimmer, were looking good for the World Series for the second time in the decade. They led the Yankees in the standings by 14 games in mid July, with less than three months to go in the regular season. The Yankees turned their season around just as the Red Sox started to collapse. By September 7, the Yankees had whittled down the 14 game deficit to only four games, just in time for a four game series at Fenway Park in Boston. The Yankees won all four games in the series by a combined score of 429. This series became known as the Boston Massacre . On September 16, the Yankees held a 3 12 game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games to overcome that deficit and finish in a first place tie with the Yankees. A tie breaker game was scheduled in Boston to determine who would win the AL East pennant for 1978. Boston pitted former Yankees pitcher Mike Torrez against the Yankees' Cy Young Award winner, Ron Guidry, who took a 243 record into the game. The Sox were beating Guidry 20 in the top of the seventh inning when light hitting Yankees shortstop Bucky Dent hit a two out, three run home run over Fenway Park's Green Monster to take a 32 lead. It was only his fifth home run of the season. The Yankees later led 52 and held on to win 54 when Yastrzemski popped out with runners on first and third, ending the Red Sox' season. Yankees closer Goose Gossage notched his 27th save of the season. Gossage would later comment years later about how he was spat on at Fenway Park and had beer thrown in his face. There is no rivalry in sports that rivals the YankeesRed Sox...that playoff game in '78it felt like the playoffs and World Series were exhibition games after that. The headline in The Boston Globe the next day summed it all up Destiny 5, Red Sox 4. New York went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series for their second straight championship. The 1980s is the only decade in which neither the Yankees nor the Red Sox won a World Series. Although both teams went to a World Series during that decade, the Red Sox were not serious contenders in the Yankees' playoff years 1980 and 1981 , but the Yankees seriously contended in the Red Sox' playoff years 1986 and 1988 . The Yankees lost the World Series in 1981, while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 20 in their respective World Series. For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 marked the beginning of the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankees left hander Dave Righetti threw a no hitter against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. On October 4, 1986, Righetti once again made history against the Red Sox when he saved both games of a doubleheader against them, finishing the season with 46 saves, and breaking the major league record shared by Dan Quisenberry and Bruce Sutter. The record would stand until Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White Sox in 1990, which would also be Righetti's last season with the Yankees. Righetti retained the single season record for left handers until 1993, when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs Righetti still owns the AL record for left handers. Righetti's teammate, first baseman and defending American League MVP Don Mattingly, came into the last game batting .352, second in the league to Boston's Wade Boggs. With Boggs sitting out the game, Mattingly needed to go 6 for 6 to win the batting title. Although Mattingly would hit a home run in his first at bat and a double later on, he fell short and Boggs won the batting title. Mattingly would be named most outstanding player that year by the press, but fell short to Boggs' teammate Roger Clemens in the AL MVP voting. Despite Righetti's pitching on the last day of the season, the Red Sox still won the division and marched on in the playoffs. The Red Sox faced the Yankees' cross town rivals, the New York Mets, in the World Series. The New York Times called the series a painful series . Newsday called it woeful days for Yankee fans . Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News called the series the World Series that is the Yankee nightmare . Both Newsday and The Boston Globe said there were Mets T shirts saying Steinbrenner's nightmare, referring to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. John Powers of the Globe quoted Claire Smith, who covered the Yankees for the Hartford Courant, as having said this really is the World Series of the nightmares . In Game 6 of the World Series, Boston leading the series 32 took a 53 lead in the top of the 10th inning. In the bottom half of the inning, Red Sox reliever Calvin Schiraldi retired the first two batters, putting the team within one out of winning the World Series. The Mets, however, scored three runs, tying the game on a wild pitch from Bob Stanley and winning it when Boston first baseman Bill Buckner allowed a ground ball hit by the Mets' Mookie Wilson to roll through his legs, scoring Ray Knight from second base. In Game 7, the Red Sox took an early 30 lead, only to lose 85. The collapses in the last two games prompted a series of articles by George Vecsey of The New York Times fueling speculation that the Red Sox were cursed . The 1987 season saw rivalry at the end of the season, as on September 29, Yankees' first baseman Don Mattingly set an MLB record by hitting his sixth grand slam home run of the season against the Red Sox The competitiveness of the teams continued the following year. Co captains Ron Guidry and Willie Randolph had led the Yankees to first place two weeks after the All Star break. On July 28, the Yankees fell out of first place, and the Red Sox won their second division title in three years. Boston went on to face the Oakland Athletics in the 1988 American League Championship Series, but would end up getting swept. In the early to mid 1990s, the two teams were seldom equally good. The Yankees had the worst record in the American League when the Red Sox won their division title in 1990. In 1992, both teams finished at or near the bottom of the AL East. In 1990, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote a book titled The Curse of the Bambino, criticizing the Red Sox for the sale of Babe Ruth, and publicized the curse. When the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium during a weekend in September 1990, Yankees fans started to chant 1918 to taunt the Red Sox, reminding them of the last time they won a World Series. Each time the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium afterward, demeaning chants of 1918 echoed through the stadium. Yankees fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying 1918 , CURSE OF THE BAMBINO , pictures of Babe Ruth, and wearing 1918 T shirts each time they were at the Stadium. On June 6, 1990, before a YankeesRed Sox game at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Bucky Dent as their manager, making Fenway Park the scene of his worst moment as manager, although he had his greatest moment as a player there. Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field, while players on the Yankees, including former Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone and Mattingly felt Dent was used as a scapegoat. Dan Shaughnessy criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and said he should have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore to fire Dent. He said that if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook. He also said that the firing was only special because...it's the first time a Yankees manager...was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay. The 1993 season saw long time Red Sox fan favorite Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven seasons with Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last moment reprieve. Trailing 31, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out with two outs in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a Mattingly single. The Yankees' 1980s demise and downfall continued into the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with the best record in the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 199495 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the Yankees and Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike. The strike was the harbinger of the 1995 season for the Yankees. Although the Red Sox jumped out to a fast start and finished the season in first place, the Yankees were not serious contenders for the division title. With the Yankees clinching the inaugural American League Wild Card on the last day of the season, the Yankees and Red Sox reached the post season in the same season for the first time. Before the postseason began, Mattingly contemplated about the first ever playoff series in the rivalry, saying, That would be pretty cool. It wouldn't hurt the rivalry any. There'd be a few deaths...just kidding . Both teams lost in separate ALDS series, with the Red Sox being swept by the Cleveland Indians and the Yankees losing in five games to the Seattle Mariners. For the Yankees, the loss led to another post strike fallout both Showalter and general manager Gene Michael were fired as a result of the loss. Similarly, the firing of Showalter as Yankees manager and the loss in the 1981 World Series were fallouts from the strike that year. In fact, the 1981 strike was antecedence to the Yankees' demise and downfall of the 1980s and 1990s and the strike in 1994 was part of that demise. A year after captain Don Mattingly's retirement in 1995, the Yankees won the 1996 World Series. It was their first in 18 years and the first of former Red Sox player Wade Boggs' career. Boggs celebrated the victory with a memorable moment of jumping on the horse of a NYPD officer during the celebration. The Yankees had one of the greatest seasons in baseball history in 1998. The Yankees won a then AL record 114 games and the season culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did not seriously contend for the division title. They lost their ALDS. About four months after victory, the Yankees traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, a fan favorite with the Red Sox between 1984 and 1996. Clemens was coming off two consecutive season with the Blue Jays where he had won both the pitching triple crown and the Cy Young Award in both 1997 and 1998. Once the 1999 season started, a moment of peace occurred between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankees manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him they also embraced each other at this time . Later in the game, when he came to bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season. On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second inning home run was the only hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martinez, who struck out 17 Yankeesthe most strikeouts against a Yankees team ever in a nine inning game. Martinez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, including striking out eight of the final nine batters. The teams finished first and second in their division and both made the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post season meeting in the longtime rivalry. In 1999, the Yankees and Red Sox faced each other for the first time in the ALCS. The Yankees were the defending World Series champions, while Boston had not appeared in the ALCS since 1990. The Yankees won Game 1 on a 10th inning walk off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck. Intensity built up due to this historic, first ever postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals. The Yankees would win the first two games at home with 7th inning comebacks. The lone bright spot for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Fenway Park, in what had been a much anticipated pitching match up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now with the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martinez. Martinez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven innings of work Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 131 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the World Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves. The loss to Pedro Martinez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 111. The following year at Fenway Park, the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 221, handing Boston its most lopsided home loss ever. The Yankees scored 16 total runs in the 8th and 9th innings. The Yankees lost 15 of their final 18 games that season and finished with a record of 8774, but the Red Sox failed to catch up and finished 2.5 games out of first to lose another division title to the Yankees. Despite having the lowest winning percentage of any postseason qualifier in 2000, the Yankees won their third consecutive World Series and 26th overall, in the first Subway Series since 1956, over their cross town rivals, the New York Mets, in 5 games. A year later, David Cone, one of the key players in the then most recent Yankees dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a standing ovation despite playing for the arch rivals. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th inning single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 10 Yankees win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankees pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999. On September 10, the two teams had a game against each other rained out. The next day, the country saw one of its biggest tragedies bring both sides together. Following the terrorist attacks on New York City's Twin World Trade Center Towers which ironically involved two passenger jets departing from Boston , Boston fans displayed signs saying Boston Loves New York in a rare moment of peace between the two sides of the rivalry. On September 23, the Yankees' home field hosted a memorial service titled, Prayer for America . The warm feeling of solidarity would once again be short lived as just prior to the 2003 season, Red Sox President Larry Lucchino labeled New York Yankees the Evil Empire after Cuban free agent Jose Contreras opted to sign with the Yankees instead of the Red Sox. The new ownership group had made it their personal mission to win a championship. Major League Baseball changed its scheduling format beginning in 2001, further intensifying division matchups throughout the league. The new unbalanced schedule allowed for additional games in each season between divisional rivals, replacing additional series with teams outside the division. Due to the change, the Red Sox and Yankees now played each other 18 19 times each season. The scheduling drew criticism both when it was enacted and after the fact, with some analysts even positing the unbalanced schedule hurt intra divisional play. In 2002, the Red Sox asked the Yankees for permission to interview one of George Steinbrenner's assistants, former Yankees general manager Gene Michael, for their vacant general manager position, but Steinbrenner denied their request. Boston Red Sox then hired Theo Epstein, a protege of Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, as general manager, and at 28 years old, he was the youngest general manager in baseball history. Both teams would face off in the ALCS once again in 2003. Entering the series, the Red Sox were the favorites to reach the 2003 World Series and The New York Times had endorsed a showdown between the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs, the latter of whom had not been to the World Series since 1945 and had not won a championship since 1908. Due to the unbalanced schedule, when Boston forced the ALCS to a full seven games, the seventh game set a major league record for the rivalry between the two teams it marked the first time two major league teams have played more than 25 games against each other over the course of a single season. In the top of the fourth inning of Game 3 of the ALCS at Fenway Park, Red Sox starting pitcher Pedro Martinez hit Yankees batter Karim Garcia, prompting an argument between the two players, which ended with both teams clearing the benches but no punches being thrown. In the bottom half of the inning, a pitch from Roger Clemens to Manny Ramirez was high and inside, and a brawl ensued. Ramirez swore at Clemens for the pitch. Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer, then 72 years old, and who had been the manager of the doomed 1978 Boston Red Sox, charged at Martinez the pitcher grabbed Zimmer by the head and swung him to the ground. Later, midway through the ninth inning, Garcia and Yankees pitcher Jeff Nelson fought with a Fenway Park groundskeeper, Paul Williams, in the bullpen. Two Boston Police officers issued a report saying Nelson and Garcia engaged in an unprovoked attack on Williams and summonses would be sought for the two New York Yankees for assault and battery. After reviewing the incident, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said he was very disappointed by the behavior of the participants and fined Martinez 50,000, Ramirez 25,000, Garcia 10,000, and Zimmer 5,000. In Game 7 at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 52 lead through seven innings due to an ineffective start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martinez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martinez to complete the inning. Martinez then gave up a ground rule double to Hideki Matsui, and Yankees catcher Jorge Posada blooped a double into center field that drove in two runners and tied the game. The game went into extra innings and in the bottom of the eleventh inning, leadoff hitter Aaron Boone, grandson of Ray Boone, a retired longtime scout with the Red Sox, hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield to left field, ending the game and the series, giving the Yankees their 39th American League pennant. The Long Island, New York, newspaper Newsday went to the press before the game was over, and thinking Boston would win the game, editorialized as to what was wrong with the Yankees, and why they had lost the ALCS to the Red Sox. In a postgame interview, Red Sox firstbaseman Kevin Millar described the emotions in the Red Sox locker room It was like we were all back in high school, like we'd all just gotten beat in the state playoffs, and everyone was going to graduate.... When you're a teenager and you lose the big football game, that's when you see guys cry uncontrollably. You don't see that much at this level. Two days later, the Red Sox fired Grady Little. People blamed him for the Game 7 loss, claiming he left Martinez in for too long. In an effort to build up their lineup, the Red Sox set up a potential deal that would send Texas Rangers SS and reigning AL MVP Alex Rodriguez to Boston and Manny Ramirez and other players to Texas. The deal eventually fell through after Rodriguez indicated he would not go against the MLBPA, which opposed a proposed renegotiation that would have potentially reduced Rodriguez's earnings in the later years of his contract. A freak off season basketball injury to Aaron Boone, just months removed from his historic home run, had Yankees management looking at possible options to replace him. Despite being courted by Boston for nearly three months, Rodriguez was traded to New York. That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season series against the Yankees, 109. A 13 inning comeback win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Jeter, who ran and dove into the stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove into the face of the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez after Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench clearing brawl. Though he was ejected along with Rodriguez from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 1110 come from behind victory. The Red Sox finished second to the Yankees in the AL East for the seventh straight season. Both teams would advance to the ALCS for the second straight year. After the melodrama of the 2003 ALCS, a rematch in 2004 was hotly anticipated. Yankees GM Brian Cashman said I think Boston...really are...a mirror image of us in terms of...aggressiveness and desire to win . Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina summarized the buildup This is what everyone was hoping for...it's a rematch of last year, with the best two teams in the American League . The Yankees won the first three games of the series, including a 198 rout in Game 3. No team in the history of baseball had ever won a best of seven series after being down 30. Entering the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4 at Fenway Park, Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera was attempting to close out a 43 lead. But after a leadoff walk to Kevin Millar, pinch runner Dave Roberts stole second and came around to score on an RBI single by Bill Mueller. Boston won the game in the bottom of the 12th inning on a home run by David Ortiz. Game 5 featured another extra inning Boston comeback, as the Red Sox tied the game in the 8th inning and won it in the 14th on a single hit by Ortiz that drove in Damon from second. In Game 6, Curt Schilling, who tore a tendon sheath in his right ankle during the ALDS against Anaheim, pitched seven innings of one run ball. Schilling's tendon had been sutured to his ankle to relieve the discomfort and was given local anesthetic and painkillers for the game. During the game, his sock started to absorb the blood from his freshly sutured ankle, and the bloody sock instantly became an indelible image of the dramatic series. A controversial call was made when Alex Rodriguez was called out after he intentionally slapped the ball out of Arroyo's hand while running to first base. Boston held on to win the contest, 42. They then completed their historic comeback with a blowout win in Game 7 by a score of 103. The New York Yankees blowing the 30 lead has been considered the biggest collapse in the history of baseball. The Red Sox won their first World Series championship in 86 years, completing a sweep of St. Louis in the 2004 World Series. At Yankee Stadium on April 3, 2005, the teams' first meeting since the 2004 ALCS, Yankees fans started new taunts, saying The Curse of 1918 is finally over 86 years . Let the new curse 2090 begin. They also projected the next Red Sox championship with signs saying 1918 2004 2090. A week later, the Red Sox received their World Series rings at Fenway Park before they played the Yankees. All of the Yankees went to the top step of the dugout to applaud their rivals' accomplishment. During the announcement of the lineups, Red Sox fans reciprocated by giving Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who had struggled against the Red Sox in the previous year's ALCS, a loud standing ovation, despite their booing of Alex Rodriguez. Rivera laughed and tipped his cap. In New York, the YES Network, the Yankees television network, declined to broadcast it. Instead, a fixed camera shot was focused tightly on correspondent Kimberly Jones as she described in general terms the events surrounding her afterwards, YES was criticized for the move. The Red Sox won the game 81. The Red Sox acquired starting pitcher Josh Beckett, who pitched a complete game shutout for the Florida Marlins against the Yankees to end the 2003 World Series, the end of the 2005 season. The Yankees would follow with their own off season acquisition of former Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon, a fan favorite during his four years in Boston. Damon returned to Fenway Park the following May to a mix of cheers and boos as he tipped his helmet to the fans. The Yankees completed a five game sweep of the Red Sox at Fenway Park, evoking memories of 1978's Boston Massacre . The Yankees pushed their division lead from 1 12 games up to 6 12 games over the second place Sox. Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy dubbed it the Son of Massacre. The second game of the series, which the Yankees won 1411, took four hours and 45 minutes to complete, making it the longest nine inning game in MLB history. Months after the Yankees loss in the 2006 ALDS and Torre's decision to drop a struggling Alex Rodriguez to 8th in the lineup, Rodriguez in an interview with Sports Illustrated, claimed that he had preferred to go to the Red Sox before being traded to the Yankees. The incident would be one of contention between Torre and Rodriguez as noted in Torre's book, The Yankee Years. During the third inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Ramirez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four consecutive home runs off Yankees pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three run deficit and completing a three game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park for the first time since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox where he started his career or the Houston Astros his hometown and last team he played for . Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14 game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine year reign in the division. The Red Sox went on to sweep the Colorado Rockies in the World Series. Series MVP Mike Lowell remarks, upon receiving his trophy, that the Red Sox are expected to win. Controversy erupted during the eighth inning of the final game when Alex Rodriguez's agent Scott Boras announced that Rodriguez had decided to opt out of his contract, in what was seen by many as an attempt by Boras to overshadow the series. The 2007 08 off season showed a war of words between management of both teams. Boston GM Theo Epstein called Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina a bad apple for complaining about the Yankees' 2004 trip to Japan as the Red Sox were gearing up for their own trip there. Epstein claimed that Mussina had used it as a crutch during the season. Mussina retorted back saying Yea, we used it as a crutch to win the division Later that month, Hank Steinbrenner, who had taken a bigger role with the Yankees operation from his father George, responded in a feisty manner to the popularity of Red Sox Nation in The New York Times supplemental Play Magazine 'Red Sox Nation ' What a bunch of expletive that is. That was a creation of the Red Sox and ESPN, which is filled with Red Sox fans. Go anywhere in America and you won't see Red Sox hats and jackets, you'll see Yankee hats and jackets. This is a Yankee country. We're going to put the Yankees back on top and restore the universe to order. In response, Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry inducted Hank Steinbrenner into Red Sox Nation. Steinbrenner went on to praise Henry's handling of the Red Sox and said they would always be competitive under him. In the 2008 09 off season, first baseman Mark Teixeira signed an eight year, 180 million contract with the Yankees. Tony Massarotti of The Boston Globe summed up his feelings by calling it a kick in the pants . In August 2009, the Yankees defeated the Red Sox, 2011, in which the total runs scored 31 was the most combined runs scored in a game in the history of the rivalry. Both teams made the playoffs in 2009. During the ALDS, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins to face the Los Angeles Angels who had knocked out the Red Sox. The Yankees beat the Angels and went on defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series, 42, to win their 27th World Series title in their first year in the new Yankee Stadium. Former Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was the losing pitcher for the Phillies in the deciding Game 6. In the final series of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, The Red Sox, struggling to get out of third place for much of the season, played the role of spoiler, knocking the Yankees out of first place in the American League East, relegating them to the wild card for 2010. In 2011, the Red Sox went 126 against the Yankees, including beating Yankees ace CC Sabathia four times during the season and sweeping two three game series at Yankee Stadium, the first two series of three games of more where the Yankees have been swept at home since it opened in 2009. Critics and writers forecasted overwhelmingly that the Red Sox would win the 2011 World Series. The Red Sox spent a great deal to build the team in the off season, and were about to sell at least two Red Sox as Most Valuable Player candidates by mid season. Following a disastrous first month, the Red Sox climbed in the standings. The Yankees claimed the AL East crown after the Red Sox's September struggles left them battling for the wild card with the Rays, with whom they went into the season's final game tied. On September 28, the Tampa Bay Rays staged a dramatic comeback from 70 to win 87 over the Yankees in the 12th inning. Only three minutes earlier, Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon blew a 32 lead over the Orioles in the bottom of the 9th inning, handing a 43 walk off victory to the Orioles. The Rays claimed the AL Wild Card and eliminated the Red Sox from the post season. It marked the first time in baseball history that a 9 game lead had been blown in September, becoming the worst collapse in baseball history. Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe said that the greatest choke in baseball history...feels like revenge for 2004 and 2007. The Red Sox hired outspoken manager Bobby Valentine to take Francona's place. After his signing, Valentine immediately inserted himself into the rivalry when he said he hated the Yankees. On the series of April 2022, 2012, the Red Sox celebrated the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park against the Yankees, who they played to open up the park. Both teams wore their 1912 uniforms on April 20, which the Yankees won 6 2. The Yankees came back from down, 90, to win, 159, the next day, the largest deficit they have ever overcome. They won the season series 135, their best record against the Red Sox since 2001, when they also went 135 against them, and swept the final three game series of the season at Yankee Stadium to clinch the AL East while the Red Sox finished last in the division for the first time since 1992 with their worst record since 1965. Valentine was fired soon after. Later in 2012, the Yankees acquired 2004 ALCS Game 7 winner Derek Lowe. He was the latest member of the 2004 team to later play for the Yankees. After the 2012 season, Kevin Youkilis, who the Red Sox traded to the Chicago White Sox earlier in the season, signed with the Yankees as a free agent. He had previously clashed with Joba Chamberlain when he was with Boston. In 2013, the Red Sox took the regular season series over the Yankees 13 6. The Red Sox finished the season with the best record in the American League and went on to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series to win their eighth World Series title, while the Yankees failed to make the playoffs. In 2014 the Yankees acquired Stephen Drew in exchange for Kelly Johnson in the first trade between the two teams since 1997. Both teams missed the playoffs in 2014, which was the first time in the wild card era. To start the 2015 edition of the rivalry, the first game at Yankee Stadium on April 10 went into extra innings ended up being one of the longest games ever played at 6 hours and 49 minutes going 19 innings, with the Yankees tying the game three times in the bottom of the 9th, 14th, and 16th. The Red Sox won the game, 6 5. The Yankees won the 2015 season series 11 8, including going 7 2 at Fenway Park. Towards the end of the 2016 season in September, the Yankees headed to Fenway Park trailing the first place Red Sox by only four games. The Yankees ended up getting swept and blew late inning leads in three of the four games, including giving up five runs in the ninth inning of the first game. The sweep has been dubbed Boston Massacre II in reference to the 1978 four game sweep of the Red Sox by the Yankees at Fenway. On September 28, Yankees first baseman and former Red Sox draft pick Mark Teixeira hit the final home run of his career, which was a walk off grand slam off Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly. It was the first game ending home run Teixeira had ever hit in a regular season game. It was also the firstand as of 2018, the onlywalk off grand slam hit by any player at the new Yankee Stadium. In 2017, the Red Sox won the division by two games, forcing the Yankees into the Wild Card Game. However, both teams lost in the postseason to the eventual World Series champion Houston Astros. For the third time in the history of the rivalry the previous two were 1930 and 1992 , both teams had new managers to start the 2018 season. The Yankees hired Aaron Boone and the Red Sox hired Alex Cora, both former players of their respective teams. During an early season game, a brawl erupted between both benches after Yankees first baseman Tyler Austin charged Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly for throwing at him twice in response to Austin's slide at second base earlier in the game. It became a trending topic on Twitter and the MLB's Youtube channel video of the incident became one of the most viewed, and social media commentators saw the brawl as a spark of a reignited rivalry between the two teams. By the end of the 2018 regular season, both teams qualified for the postseason and both reached the 100 win mark. It was the first time that both teams won at least 100 games in the same season and, along with the Houston Astros, the first time the American League had three 100 game winners. Following the Yankees' victory in the AL Wild Card Game, the two faced each other in the 2018 ALDS. The Red Sox won the series 31, taking Games 3 and 4 in Yankee Stadium by a combined score of 20 4. Just like in the April brawl, this series became a Twitter trending topic. In May 2018, MLB announced that the teams would play a two game series during the 2019 season at London Stadium, in the first of a two year deal to play regular season games at the venue. The MLB London Series was the first time that the two sides have played each other in regular season play outside of either New York or Boston, and was also the first MLB regular season games were played in Europe. The Yankees won both games, sweeping the series. Overall, in each of the rivalry series games played in 2019, the Yankees won 4 of the 5 losing one in early August to the Red Sox, 3 1 , and pushed the team out of divisional contention. Using Facebook Like button data, Ben Blatt of the Harvard College Sports Analysis Collective found in 2012 that Red Sox fans are east of the New York StateVermont Massachusetts border, and Yankees fans are west. Blatt wrote, I had thought that it was possible that Red Sox Nation might extend into northern New York or Yankees territory might extend into Vermont. This turned out not to be the case. Connecticut divides support between the two teams he found that 56.6 of Facebook users in Hartford, often cited as being on the border between the two teams' fans, supported the Yankees. While Blatt found that identifying an exact border within the state was impossible, Guilford and Middletown are almost exactly divided, with 50.7 in each city supporting the Yankees. There have been occasions of arrests due to violence over the rivalry. In May 2008, a Yankees fan in Nashua, New Hampshire, was arrested and charged with reckless second degree murder outside a bar, which resulted from an argument over the rivalry. Later in 2008, a man driving a car with New York license plates in Massachusetts was pulled from his car and savagely beaten because locals suspected the man of being a Yankees fan. During the final series of the 2010 season, Boston Police arrested a Yankees fan for stabbing a Red Sox fan over an argument about the rivalry. Don Mattingly had appeared in public service announcements airing on the Spike TV network advocating fathers to spend time with their children as part of the True Dads campaign to encourage men to take an active role in their children's lives. Mattingly jokes at the end of the commercial about the impatience of one of the characters in the commercial by calling him a Red Sox fan. On April 13, 2008, rumors of a construction worker burying a Red Sox jersey in the concrete of the new Yankee Stadium were verified. The worker, identified as Gino Castignoli, buried a David Ortiz jersey in what would become a service corridor in the hopes of cursing the new stadium. After extracting the jersey from underneath two feet of concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox. Whatever curse was intended failed to bear fruit with the Yankees winning the World Series in their first year at the new stadium. On October 23, 2007, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is a Yankees fan, said at a New Hampshire event for his presidential campaign that he was going to cheer for the Red Sox during their World Series appearance against the Colorado Rockies. Giuliani justified his support of the Red Sox by proclaiming he was a fan of American League baseball. The following day, the New York Post and New York Daily News printed doctored photos of Giuliani as a Red Sox fan on their covers with the headlines RED COAT and TRAITOR respectively. Topps parodied this in a 2008 baseball card altered to depict Giuliani on the field with the Red Sox as the team celebrated their 2007 World Series championship. A month later, he was asked about his support for the Red Sox by one of the questioners in a Republican Presidential Debate. In response to the mayor's answer, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who was in office during the Red Sox 2004 win, claimed that all Americans are united in hatred of the Yankees. Giuliani's successor, Michael Bloomberg, grew up in Boston as a Red Sox fan, but later switched his allegiance to the Yankees after assuming office. However, Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio openly supported the Red Sox World Series run during his 2013 campaign, winning the general election by a huge margin. During the 2010 special Senate election in Massachusetts, Martha Coakley, the Democratic candidate and state Attorney General, faced a mild backlash for deriding Curt Schilling as another Yankee fan on a local radio show, after Schilling endorsed Coakley's Republican opponent, state senator Scott Brown. Many critics alleged that Coakley's apparent unfamiliarity with Schilling demonstrated a lack of awareness toward her Massachusetts constituents. Schilling would responded, I've been called a lot of things...but never, I mean never, could anyone make the mistake of calling me a Yankee fan. Well, check that if you didn't know what the hell is going on in your own state maybe you could. Brown, who had polled as much as 30 points behind Coakley a month before the election, had seen a late surge in support prior to Coakley's comments and would eventually win a come from behind victory against her in the election. In 2002, when the NFL's New England Patriots held their victory celebration after winning their first Super Bowl and the first championship for the city of Boston since the Celtics won the 1986 NBA Finals, linebacker Larry Izzo fired up the crowd, chanting Yankees suck The chant would become a fixture of Patriots Super Bowl victory rallies following their victories in Super Bowls XXXVIII in 2004 and XXXIX in 2005, which were sandwiched around the Red Sox 2004 World Series win. Dan Shaughnessy wrote about the chant Can you imagine a Giants or a Jets celebration in New York City in which a New York player would take the time to chant, 'Red Sox suck ' Shaughnessy opined that should such a thing occur, it would be more likely at a Jets celebration, as a Giants celebration, like those of the Mets and the Rangers, would be more likely to feature such chants made in reference to the Philadelphia teams, as one of the Giants' primary rivalries is with the Philadelphia Eagles. The rivalry was played out during Super Bowl XLII in February 2008, as it was a showdown between football teams from each metropolitan area, the New York Giants and the New England Patriots. The Giants defeated the Patriots in what was considered one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history. After the game Giants fans chanted 18 and 1 18 and 1 , reminiscent of the infamous 1918 chant, towards Patriots fans as they left the stadium. Had they won the game, the Patriots would have become the first NFL team to ever finish with a 190 record, and only the second NFL team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to have a perfect season. Giants fans called this revenge for the Red Sox comeback in 2004. The Giants and Patriots faced off again in Super Bowl XLVI with the Giants once again defeating the Patriots. Dan Shaughnessy's piece in The Boston Globe on the Giants victory over the Patriots was headlined, History Repeats. During the 2008 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, movie director Spike Lee, a season ticket holder of the New York Knicks, wore a Yankees jersey and cap at Game 3 of the Finals in Los Angeles. Lee sat behind the Boston bench while loudly cheering for the Lakers, though he has a friendship with Ray Allen of the Celtics. For the 2010 NHL Winter Classic outdoor ice hockey game held at Fenway Park, Boston Bruins then backup goaltender Tuukka Rask had artwork on his special event goalie mask's upper front area depicting a roaring bear with a ripped New York Yankees home pinstripe jersey falling from its lower jaw. In 2011, NBA star LeBron James worked a deal with Red Sox owner John Henry to take partial ownership of Henry's soccer subsidiary Liverpool Football Club of the Premier League. James was criticized in the New York media for spurning New York due to his being a purported Yankees fan. On June 27, 2011, the Yankees Red Sox feud spilled into the world of professional wrestling when CM Punk was cutting a promo against Boston native John Cena. CM Punk went on to call John Cena a hypocrite for reasons that were unfolding in their respective storyline and said that John Cena had become the very thing he had despised in the wrestling business. He concluded this promo by calling Cena the New York Yankees . Cena then punched Punk for comparing him to his home team's famed rivals. Punk What you've lost sight of is what you are, and what you are is what you hate. You're the 10 time WWE Champion You're the man You, like the Red Sox, like Boston, are no longer the underdog You're a dynasty. You are what you hate. You have become the New York Yankees John Cena immediately punches Punk, who scoots out of the ring, grabs the contract, and goes up the ramp. Points respectively to Vince McMahon and John Cena You're Steinbrenner, and you might as well be Jeter Mr. 3000, I'm the underdog Rivalries between other New York sports teams and other Boston sports teams have been attributed to the YankeesRed Sox rivalry. For example, some have pointed out the connections between this rivalry and those of the New York Jets and the New England Patriots in the NFL and the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics in the NBA. Since the owners of the Yankees are involved with Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owner of Manchester City F.C. and the Red Sox being involved with Liverpool F.C., the 2014 International Champions Cup match between Manchester City and Liverpool at Yankee Stadium carried the classic angle of the Yankees and Red Sox rivalry. Liverpool defeated Manchester City in a penalty shoot out. The nature of the rivalry has led to games between the two teams being broadcast on national television. Whenever the two teams play a weekend series, the Friday game is broadcast on MLB Network, the Saturday game is broadcast on either Fox or Fox Sports 1, while the Sunday game is broadcast on either TBS in the afternoon or ESPN as part of Sunday Night Baseball the New England Sports Network in the Boston market and the YES Network in the New York City market always carry games not assigned on either Fox, FS1 unless specified , or on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. Whenever they play games during the week, there are games broadcast on MLB Network, FS1, and ESPN. When the games are broadcast on Fox, Fox's lead broadcast team of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the game. Thus, the duo has called many significant moments in the rivalry. In 2004, the first game of the season between the two teams, on Friday, April 16, was nationally broadcast on Fox, because it marked the first time the two teams were facing each other since the memorable 2003 American League Championship Series. Fox Sports President Ed Goren said of decision to have the game broadcast on Fox If were up to me, we'd take the whole series and come back a week later and carry all their games at Yankee Stadium...We started thinking about this at some point after the Yankees closed the deal with A Rod. ... This is sort of a relaunch of the season in the middle of April. This is going to be an event. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called the broadcast an extension of the postseason brought into April. This was the first over the air broadcast of a regular season game in prime time since Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break Roger Maris' record in 1998. In October, when the two teams met in the ALCS, Selig moved Game 5 of the series to primetime due to the rematch. The broadcasts of the games between the rivals have led to an increase in television ratings. These games have had at least 50 higher ratings than all of the other games broadcast, sometimes almost twice as high than locally broadcast games. In most cases, the most watched MLB game on any network during a season is a game between the Yankees and the Red Sox. Since 2003, ratings for YankeesRed Sox games on Fox have averaged 2.6 percent of homes44 percent better than other weeks, while ESPN has averaged 3.96 million viewers for YankeesRed Sox games on Sunday nights, compared to the average of 2.18 million for all other games. Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS drew a 17.1 rating, the highest for a League Championship Series game since Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series. In 2004, the first game between the two teams drew a 3.6 national rating, and with an average audience of 5.3 million, it was the most watched regular season telecast since Mark McGwire's record breaking home run game. In 2003, Saturday games on Fox averaged a 2.5 rating prime time entertainment got a 3.3, but Goren said that he expected the game will perform much higher than those prime time figures as a reason to have the game broadcast nationally. In 2011, the three game series between the two teams on the weekend of August 57 drew large television viewers. The August 5 game on MLB Network drew 563,000 viewers, making it the second most watched game on the network, behind Stephen Strasburg's debut. In New York and Boston, it was blacked out because the YES Network had local rights in New York City and NESN in Boston. The August 6 game on Fox was most watched non primetime regular season MLB telecast on the network in more than three years with 4.10 million viewers. The last Fox non primetime telecast to record higher numbers also was Boston vs. New York on July 5, 2008. The Sunday game on ESPN drew 4.72 million viewers, making it the most watched baseball game on ESPN since June 3, 2007, when both teams faced each other, and the most watched MLB broadcast of the 2011 regular season on any network.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankees%E2%80%93Red%20Sox%20rivalry
"Yantaromyrmex is an extinct genus of ants first described in 2013. Members of this genus are in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the family Formicidae, known from Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene fossils found in Europe. The genus currently contains five described species, Y. constrictus, Y. geinitzi, Y. intermedius, Y. mayrianum and Y. samlandicus. The first specimens were collected in 1868 and studied by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr, who originally placed the fossils in other ant genera until the fossils were reviewed and subsequently placed into their own genus. These ants are small, measuring from 4 to 6 mm 0.16 to 0.24 in in length and can be characterized by their trapezoidal shaped head capsules and oval compound eyes that are located slightly to the rear of the capsules midpoint, with no known ocelli present. Individuals of Yantaromyrmex species have been found as inclusions in four different Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene amber deposits in Europe. Baltic amber is approximately 46 million years old, having been deposited during the Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting them being relatives of either Agathis or Pseudolarix. Rovno amber, recovered from deposits in the Rivne region of Ukraine, is slightly younger in age, being dated to the Bartonian to Priabonian of the Late Eocene. Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. Bitterfeld represents a section of the Eocene Paratethys Sea, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. The amber deposits on the Danish coast, often referred to as Scandinavian amber, is of similar age to the other three European ambers, however a study of the ant fauna publushed in 2009 indicates Scandinavian amber has a fairly distinct ant assemblage. Y. constricta and Y. geinitzi are both identified from all four European ambers, while Y. samlandicus has been described from Baltic, Bitterfeld and Rovno fossils. Y. intermedius and Y. mayrianum, are each known from only a few fossils, Y. intermedius from only a single Bitterfeld amber fossil while Y. mayrianum is known from a Baltic amber and a Rovno amber fossil. The type specimens of Y. geinitzi and Y. constrictus were collected in 1868, and when first described were part of the University of Konigsberg's amber collection. The fossils were initially studied by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr who placed the two species in the genus Hypoclinea, now considered a junior synonym of the living genus Dolichoderus. Mayr's 1868 type descriptions of the new species were published in the journal Beitrage zur Naturkunde Preussens. All the Y. samlandicus syntypes were collected by 1915, and the first 73 described were part of the University of Konigsberg amber collection. These fossils were first studied by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, whose type description of Iridomyrmex samlandica was published in the journal Schriften der Physikalisch Okonomischen Gesellschaft zu Konigsberg. Both Y. geinitzi and Y. constrictus were both moved from Hypoclinea to the small related genus Bothriomyrmex in 1873 by Dalla Torre. In his 1915 paper The ants of Baltic Amber Wheeler suggested both species and the newly named I. samlandica would be better placed in the genus Iridomyrmex and noted Y. geinitzi to be one of the most abundant ant species in the Baltic amber he had studied. Wheeler based the placement on the structuring of the labial and maxillary palpi. This placement was unchallenged until the genus was reviewed, redefined and split up in 1992 by Steven Shattuck. In his review, Iridomyrmex was split into a more restricted genus group while the other species which did not match the definition of that genus were moved to other genera. At that time Shattuck provisionally kept Y. geinitzi in Iridomyrmex citing a lack of specimens for him to study, while both Y. constrictus and Y. samlandicus were transferred to the genus Anonychomyrma. The placements of Y. geinitzi was retained until 2011 when Shattuck and Brian Heterick again reviewed Iridomyrmex. With more fossils to study and based on a number of characters, Y. geinitzi was also moved to Anonychomyrma. The three species were reviewed again, this time in 2013. The species were examined by Russian entomologists G.M. Dlussky and D.A. Dubovikoff, who they came to the conclusion that the three species, along with two unnamed species, were distinct from Anonychomyrma and Iridomyrmex. Based on the differences they noted, Dlussky and Dubovikoff erected the new genus Yantaromyrmex in 2013 for these ants and described two new species, Y. intermedius and Y. mayrinaum. The name is a combination of the Russian word , translated as yantar, meaning amber and the Greek which means ant . They noted the new species name intermedius was derived from the Latin word of that same spelling, meaning intermediate . They chose the name mayrianum to honor Gustav Mayr for his work as a myrmecologist. The genus is characterized by workers which have head capsules that are trapezoidal in shape, narrowing at the front and widening towards the rear of the capsule. The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly to the rear of the capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a number of teeth along the masticatory margin the middle area of the mandibles and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal sternite. Overall Y. constrictus can be distinguished from the congeneric Y. geinitzi in several ways. Y. geinitzi individuals are overall more gracile in form with a less constricted mesonotum and the mesosoma has a less convex appearance. Y. constrictus specimens have maxillary palps sensory organs which are six jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and an abundantly hairy body. The antennae have a scape the first segment of the antenna which just passes the back edge of the head capsule on both female and ergatomorphic male workers. The ergatomorphs have larger and more rounded compound eyes than the workers, and the antennae are overall longer than in the workers. Both males and workers have a five segmented gaster and the males are distinguished by the slightly protruding stipites the second segment of the maxilla at the tip of segment five. Overall Y. geinitzi can be distinguished from the related Baltic amber species Y. constricta in several ways. Y. geinitzi individuals are overall more gracile in form with a less constricted mesonotum and the mesosoma has a less convex appearance. Y. geinitzi specimens have maxillary palps which are six jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and the clypeal border is sinuately indented in the middle. The pupae which Wheeler referred to the species are noted to not have any cocoon unlike the modern larvae of some ant subfamilies which will spin a cocoon to pupate in. The eyes of Y. geinitzi are placed more to the front and sides of the head capsule than seen in Iridomyrmex species. Due to the shape of Y. geinitzi, the species may have been a herpetobiont an inhabitant of the soils surface , but scientists suggest that these ants inhabited trees, dwelling inside epiphytes and dead plant material such as branches . The only specimen of Y. intermedius is 4.5 millimetres 0.18 in that has several cracks surrounding it, and areas of white mold coatings. The indent behind the propodeum the first abdominal segment is deep, the connection between the segment and the thorax is wide and covered in wrinkles of the exoskeleton. The propodeum has an angular appearance with a rounded corner when viewed from the side. This separates the species from both Y. geinitzi and Y. mayrianum. The legs of Y. intermedius are generally free of hairs while the mesosoma and head have only a few sparse hairs on the upper surface. This is different than the much hairier Y. constrictus which always has numerous erect hairs on the body and legs. The high conical propodeum and scape which does not extend to the edge ofhte head capsule isolate Y. intermedius from Y. samlandicus. The right antennae of the type specimen is preserved with the head of a Ctenobethylus goepperti worker ant clamped near the tip, and it seems the two had just fought prior to entombment. Workers of Y. mayrianum range in length from approximately 4 to 5 mm 0.16 to 0.20 in and look very similar to workers of Y. geinitzi. In both species the indent behind the first abdominal segment is broader and shallower than seen in Y. constrictus, Y. samlandicus and Y. intermedius. Also unlike the other three species the first abdominal segments surface is smooth and unsculptured. Y. mayrianum can be distinguished from Y. geinitzi by the amount of hairs found on the workers body. In Y. mayrianum there is abundant erect hair covering the entire body, on the underside head capsule and along the eye margins and leg undersides. In contrast Y. geinitzi workers have smooth eye margins and legs, and a sparse scattering of hairs on the mseosoma, last segments of the abdomen and along the upper side of the head. Y. samlandicus specimens have maxillary palps which are six jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and a total body length between 5.56.0 millimetres 0.220.24 in . The antennae each possess twelve segments and a scape that curves at the base. The thorax is narrower in profile than the head capsule, reaching its widest in the broad flattened pronotum. The petiole is notably broad and short, having a high node that has a rounded point on the upper side. Y. samlandicus specimens have fine to coarse punctuation small spots across the head and thorax and an overall coloration that is black, though some specimens have a reddish tone to the legs or antennae.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantaromyrmex
"Zar'a Ya qob or Zera Yacob Ge'ez zar'a yaiqob, English Descendant of Jacob 1399 26 August 1468 was the Emperor ngusa nagast of Ethiopia, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty who ruled under regnal name Kwestantinos I Ge'ez qwastantinos or Constantine I, from the old province of Shewa, where the capital of the Amhara emperors was located before the post 16th century Oromo migrations and the destructive war with Gran Ahmad. Born at Telq in the province of Fatajar now part of the Oromia Region, near the Awash River , Zara Yaqob was the youngest son of Dawit I and his youngest wife, Igzi Kebra. The British expert on Ethiopia, Edward Ullendorff, stated that Zara Yaqob was unquestionably the greatest ruler Ethiopia had seen since Ezana, during the heyday of Aksumite power, and none of his successors on the throne excepted only the emperors Menelik II and Haile Selassie can be compared to him. Paul B. Henze repeats the tradition that the jealousy of his older brother Tewodros I forced the courtiers to take Zara Yaqob to Tigray where he was brought up in secret, and educated in Axum and at the monastery of Debre Abbay. While admitting that this tradition is invaluable as providing a religious background for Zar'a Ya'iqob's career , Taddesse Tamrat dismisses this story as very improbable in its details. The professor notes that Zara Yaqob wrote in his Mashafa Berhan that he was brought down from the royal prison of Mount Gishan only on the eve of his accession to the throne. Upon the death of Emperor Dawit, his older brother Tewodros ordered Zara Yaqob confined on Amba Geshen around 1414 . Despite this, Zara Yaqob's supporters kept him a perennial candidate for Emperor, helped by the rapid succession of his older brothers to the throne over the next 20 years, and left him as the oldest qualified candidate. David Buxton points out the effect that his forced seclusion had on his personality, deprived of all contact with ordinary people or ordinary life. Thrust into a position of leadership with no experience of the affairs of state, he was faced by a kingdom seething with plots and rebellions, a Church riven with heresies, and outside enemies constantly threatening invasion. Buxton continues, Although he became Emperor in 1434, Zara Yaqob was not crowned until 1436 at Axum, where he resided for three years. It was not unusual for Ethiopian rulers to postpone their coronation until later in their reigns. After he became Emperor, Zara Yaqob married princess Eleni, who had converted from Islam before their marriage. Eleni was the daughter of the king of Hadiya, one of the Sidamo kingdoms south of the Abay River. Although she failed to bear him any children, Eleni grew into a powerful political person. When a conspiracy involving one of his Bitwodeds came to light, Zara Yaqob reacted by appointing his two daughters, Medhan Zamada and Berhan Zamada, to these two offices. According to the Chronicle of his reign, the Emperor also appointed his daughters and nieces as governors over eight of his provinces. These appointments were not successful. He defeated Badlay ad Din, the Sultan of Adal at the Battle of Gomit in 1445, which consolidated his hold over the Sidamo kingdoms in the south, as well as the weak Muslim kingdoms beyond the Awash River. Similar campaigns in the north against the Agaw and the Falasha were not as successful. After witnessing a bright light in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley's Comet, visible in Ethiopia in 1456 , Zara Yaqob founded Debre Berhan and made it his capital for the remainder of his reign. In his later years, Zara Yaqob became more despotic. When Takla Hawariat, abbot of Dabra Libanos, criticized Yaqob's beatings and murder of men, the emperor had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where he died after few months. Zara Yaqob was convinced of a plot against him in 1453, which led to more brutal actions. He increasingly became convinced that his wife and children were plotting against him, and had several of them beaten. Seyon Morgasa, the mother of the future emperor Baeda Maryam I, died from this mistreatment in 1462, which led to a complete break between son and father. Eventually relations between the two were repaired, and Zara Yaqob publicly designated Baeda Maryam as his successor. At the time Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided over the issue of Biblical Sabbath observance for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh day Sabbath i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath and Sunday should be observed. He was successful in persuading two recently arrived Egyptian Abuns, Mikael and Gabriel, into accepting a compromise aimed at restoring harmony with the House of Ewostatewos, as the followers of Ewostatewos were known. At the same time, he made efforts to pacify the House of Ewostatewos. While the Ewostathians were won over to the compromise by 1442, the two Abuns only agreed to the compromise at the Council of Debre Mitmaq in Tegulet 1450 . Emperor Zara Yaqob also continued as the defender of the Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 of the destruction of the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az Zahir Sayf ad Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic churches he had destroyed. According to Richard Pankhurst the Emperor was also reputedly an author of renown , having contributed to Ethiopian literature as many as three important theological works. One was Mahsafa Berha The Book of Light , an exposition of his ecclesiastical reforms and a defence of his religious beliefs the others were Mahsafa Milad The Book of Nativity and Mahsafa Selassie The Book of the Trinity . Zara Yaqob sent delegates to the Council of Florence in 1441, and established ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when council prelates insisted on calling their monarch Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John. He also sent a diplomatic mission to Europe 1450 , asking for skilled labour. The mission was led by a Sicilian, Pietro Rombulo, who had previously been successful in a mission to India. Rombulo first visited Pope Nicholas V, but his ultimate goal was the court of Alfonso V of Aragon, who responded favorably. Krebs, Verena 2019 .

"Norman Walter Dransfield Yardley 19 March 1915 3 October 1989 was an English cricketer who played for Cambridge University, Yorkshire County Cricket Club and England, as a right handed batsman and occasional bowler. An amateur, he captained Yorkshire from 1948 to 1955 and England on fourteen occasions between 1947 and 1950, winning four Tests, losing seven and drawing three. Yardley was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948 and in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was described as Yorkshire's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson. Yardley played schoolboy cricket at St Peter's, York. A highly talented all round sportsman, he went to St John's College, Cambridge, and won Blues at cricket, squash, rugby fives and field hockey. In the university matches, he scored 90 in his second year, 101 in his third and was captain for his final year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county until 1955, when he retired as a player. He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the Second World War was chosen as vice captain to Wally Hammond on the 194647 tour of Australia where he captained England in the fifth Test. He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947, and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed. In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when Brian Sellers resigned. Yardley remained in the position until 1955, during a time when Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room. Under Yardley, Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 but too often for the liking of supporters, finished second to Surrey in the County Championship. He served as a Test match selector between 1951 and 1954, acting as chairman of selectors in 1952. He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1983, when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release Geoffrey Boycott in 1983. He died after a stroke in 1989. Yardley was born in Royston, near Barnsley, on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real background in cricket. He was sent to St Peter's, York, where he made a good impression as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years. In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs at an average of 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the bowling averages, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket. His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord's Cricket Ground, in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team mate Denis Compton. In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions. While still at school, he came to the attention of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst. He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934. Leaving St Peter's School, Yardley went to St John's College, Cambridge University, where he immediately began to show all round ability at sports. He won the North of England Squash Championships every year between 1934 and 1939, and won his Blue in hockey, squash, and Rugby Fives. However, his main distinction came from cricket, where he was a Blue in each his four years at Cambridge. He played for the University team in his first year, the 1935 season, making ten first class appearances without much success. His Wisden obituary noted that class rather than performance guaranteed his place. He made his first class debut against Sussex, scoring a duck in his first innings and 24 runs in the second. He passed fifty on just one occasion that season, scoring 319 runs at an average of 16.78, and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket. Nevertheless, he played in the University Match, scoring just 19 and 36. In the following season, Yardley improved considerably, becoming a dominant force in University Cricket according to Wisden. His maiden first class century came in a narrow Cambridge victory over the Army, and he scored a second against Surrey, remaining not out for 116 in a total of 359. Bowling much more regularly, his maiden wickets in first class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against Yorkshire, including the wicket of Len Hutton. Yardley topped the Cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in the University Match. This display impressed Stanley Jackson, an influential former Yorkshire amateur cricketer, and he urged the Yorkshire selectors to include Yardley in the first team. Yardley was still appearing in the county second team at this stage, but at the end of August, he made his debut for the Yorkshire first eleven, appearing in the County Championship match against Derbyshire. He scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket. He played in a further seven matches for Yorkshire, scoring 309 runs in ten innings with a highest score of 89 against Hampshire, with further fifties against Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club MCC . In all first class cricket that season, Yardley scored 1,017 runs at an average of 37.66 and took 12 wickets at an average of 26.08. Yardley continued to make progress in his batting in 1937. For Cambridge, he scored fifties against the Army and Surrey. Against Hampshire he took four for 47 and five for 41, and when Cambridge collapsed to 35 for six chasing a victory target of 141, he scored 64 not out to take the side to a win. Playing Sussex, he scored a century and took four for 36, while in the University match, he scored 101 in two and a half hours. Yardley's form saw him selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, although he scored only 7 and 4, and when he joined Yorkshire after the Cambridge season, he made his first century for the county against Surrey, as well as three other fifties. His overall first class figures were 1,472 runs at an average of 33.45 and 31 wickets at an average of 21.87. He was picked for the winter MCC tour of India, under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson, where he scored 519 runs at an average 25.95 but only took one wicket. No official Tests were played on the tour, but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place, scoring 96 in the first game, but his highest score in four other innings was 31. Honours continued to come Yardley's way in the 1938 season. He was chosen to captain Cambridge in his final season in the team although his side did not win a match, Yardley enjoyed some personal success. Among his fifties were innings of 67 against the touring Australian team and 61 in the University Match. He was included in different representative sides he was selected in a Test trial, playing for the Rest, and played a second game against the Australians for the Gentlemen of England, although he did not pass fifty in either match. For the Gentlemen against the Players, Yardley scored 88. He did not make the full England side but was twelfth man in two Tests against Australia. His highest innings of the season was 97 for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire, and in all first class matches, Yardley accumulated 1,217 runs at an average of 31.20 and took 22 wickets at 35.45. By this stage, Yorkshire regarded Yardley as the heir to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At the end of the 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice captain to Wally Hammond. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border. Having built up a reputation as one of the best amateur cricketers in England, Yardley played three early season matches for the MCC, but he was selected for neither the Gentlemen nor for England that year. He played his first full season for Yorkshire, scoring centuries against Cambridge, Warwickshire and Sussex in total, he scored 1,086 runs at an average of 27.84 and took 17 wickets. War brought first class cricket to an end in 1939, and Yardley joined the first battalion of the Green Howards, along with his Yorkshire team mate Hedley Verity. After training in Omagh, Northern Ireland, where he played several cricket matches with Verity, he served in India, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Sicily, Italy and Iraq. In January 1944, he was wounded in Italy, rejoining the First Battalion in Iraq on his recovery to become an instructor, before being demobilised at the end of the war. When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Yardley scored 788 runs at an average of 23.17, with just one century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less frequently than before the war and took only nine wickets. He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs. Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter, continuing his pre war role. It was intended that Yardley would appear lower down in the batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting that he did not back away from the fast bowlers, who frequently bowled bouncers at him In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university. He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries. Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitcheshe was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective. The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team mate slapped him on the back and shouted Well, bowled, Spofforth . In the Tests, Yardley's only scores over fifty, his first in Test cricket, came in the third Test, where he scored 61 and 53 not out. In England's first innings, he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse, surviving for two hours. His second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped England to avoid defeat for the first time in the series. In the same match, Yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on the whole tour, following injuries to Bill Voce and Bill Edrich, two of England's main bowlers. Bowling leg theory with a fielders concentrated on the leg side, Yardley managed to move the ball off the seam. He dismissed Bradman twice in the match, having figures of three for 67 in the second innings and taking five wickets in the match. This was the first time that an England player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a Test. Yardley also had substantial bowling workload in the fourth Test, delivering 31 overs in Australia's first innings to take three for 101. When Hammond did not play in the final Test, Yardley became captain, doing so courageously according to Wisden, which also pointed out that Yardley used field placing more effectively than Hammond. In the series, Yardley scored 252 runs at an average of 32.50, His ten wickets at an average of 37.20 placed him first in the series bowling averages. He played in the drawn Test on the short tour to New Zealand which followed, opening the batting scoring 22 and taking a wicket. Yardley enjoyed his most successful season with the bat in the 1947 season, scoring 1,906 runs at an average of 44.32 with five centuries his bowling took eleven wickets. Following Hammond's retirement immediately after the 194647 tour, Yardley captained England against South Africa throughout the season. In the first Test, he made his highest Test score. England were unexpectedly made to follow on in the face of a large South African total when Yardley came to the crease in the second innings, England looked likely to be defeated at 170 for four, still 155 runs behind the tourists. Yardley scored 99, being caught in the slips just before reaching his century, but his batting had helped to save the game and earned praise from Wisden for batting soundly .He eventually became the first test captain to be dismissed for 99 in a test innings Yardley and Denis Compton added 237, which was a record partnership for the fifth wicket in England and remains, in August 2010, England's best fifth wicket stand against South Africa. Yardley's only other score over fifty in the series came in the drawn fifth Test when he scored 59. However, he scored 41 in just over an hour in helpful conditions for fast bowlers in the third Test and 36 on a difficult pitch in the fourth Test. Yardley scored 273 runs at an average of 39.00 in the series. In contrast to his efforts in Australia, he bowled just six overs in the series without taking a wicket. England won the second, third and fourth Tests to win the series, helped by a negative approach from the tourists. Yardley captained the Gentlemen against the Players for the first time, at Lord's and Scarborough, and captained The Rest against Middlesex, the County Champions. His batting and captaincy in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. Following Brian Sellers resignation, Yardley was appointed Yorkshire captain at the start of the 1948 season. With his England commitments and other absences, he only played in 12 County Championship matches. He had not toured the West Indies with MCC in 194748, when Gubby Allen captained the side. However, Yardley resumed his leadership of England when Australia, captained by Bradman, toured the country without losing a match. Yardley led the MCC in an early match against the tourists, and captained England in a Test trial, but only played three other games, all for Yorkshire, before the first Test, with a top score of 46. In the first Test, England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in difficult conditions. Wisden did not blame Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well. He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia's scoring rate, taking a wicket himself with his fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32. The Australian batsmen found it difficult to score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344. Yardley batted an hour in the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win. Before the second Test, Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians, and although unsuccessful with the bat, took two for nine with the ball, his first wickets of the season for his county. England adopted an aggressive strategy in the second Test, but could not avoid a second defeat. Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings, and took two for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage. However, the lower order batsmen mounted a recovery, Yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl Doug Wright. The England captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with Denis Compton, scoring 44 himself, but Australia led by 135 on first innings. Yardley took two wickets in two balls in Australia's second innings, narrowly missing a hat trick when Keith Miller only just got his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled, and had figures of two for 36, but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186. In between Tests, Yardley scored his only century of the season, but his contributions to the third Test were minimal. He scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs. However, the home side fought back in the match, for which Len Hutton was dropped. England scored 363 and bowled out Australia for 221. They scored 174 for three before declaring, but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win. England maintained their newly confident approach, being on top for most of the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors Godfrey Evans, the England wicket keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match. Around this time, and particularly after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 40. Yardley managed 150 runs at an average of 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer. Yardley's only other representative appearance in 1948 was as captain of the Gentlemen against the Players at Lords, where he scored 61. In the whole season, he scored 1,061 runs at an average of 29.47 and 14 wickets at an average of 35.14he took just five wickets outside of the Tests. Yardley was unavailable to captain the MCC tour of South Africa in the winter of 194849, which was led by George Mann. Mann did well enough to retain the position for two Tests in the 1949 season Freddie Brown captained the other two and Yardley did not play for England that year. In all first class matches that season, he scored 1,612 runs at an average of 37.48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33.86. He did not score a century in the County Championship, but passed three figures for Yorkshire against the New Zealand touring team and for the North against the South in a festival match. His only representative game outside of festival matches was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's Mann was appointed captain for the game. That season, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, the only time Yorkshire won the competition during Yardley's leadership. Yardley's batting form dipped in the 1950 season. He scored 1,082 runs at an average of 24.59, the final time he reached four figures in a season. With the ball he took 19 wickets at an average of 32.10. Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind joint winners Lancashire and Surrey. It took seven matches for Yardley to reach fifty runs in an innings, but he hit centuries against Surrey, Somerset and Scotland in the second half of the season. The West Indies toured England and Yardley resumed the England captaincy he also captained MCC against the tourists and England against The Rest in a Test trial. However, neither Yardley nor Mann, the two likeliest candidates, were able to accept the captaincy of the MCC side in Australia that winter. The selectors spent much of the season assessing other players. Although Yardley represented the Gentlemen against the Players, the side was led by Brown, who scored a century and was appointed captain of the touring side. Brown also assumed the captaincy of England for the final Test against West Indies and Yardley was left out of the team. In the three Tests he played, Yardley scored 108 runs at an average of 18.00 with a top score of 41. He won the first Test but lost the next two, West Indies' first Test wins in England the final Test was also lost by Brown. Following this series, Yardley did not play any more Tests, although his name was mentioned as a potential captain in 1953 before Hutton was appointed as England's first professional captain of the twentieth century. At the time, Yardley was still considered the best amateur candidate. In 20 Tests, Yardley scored 812 runs at an average of 25.37 and four fifties. With the ball, he took 21 wickets at an average of 33.66. On the fourteen occasions he was captain, he won four times, lost seven and drew three. Yorkshire finished second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the 1951 season and second to Surrey in the 1952 season. However, in following season, Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth, their worst ever finish at that time. In the following two seasons, the team were again runners up, Surrey winning on both occasions. Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season, but only managed two more centuries. These were 183 not out against Hampshire in 1951, the highest innings of his career, and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season. His batting average was generally between 24 and 31, except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36.53. Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952, delivering more overs than any other time in his career in the latter year. He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season, his highest two season totals, and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions, having only done so twice before. However, he bowled less often during his final three seasons, with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets. His only representative cricket, apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce's XI, was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1954. Judgements were mixed on Yardley's performance as Yorkshire's captain. His record would have been considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. Trevor Bailey, who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under. Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players. Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control. Yardley disliked confrontation, and Ray Illingworth, who played under him, described him as too nice to stand up to his players. But Bob Appleyard, another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner, and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians. Generally, he was popular with his players. Between 1951 and 1954, Yardley served as a Test selector, serving as chairman in 1952 at the time when Hutton was chosen as England captain. Following the 1955 season, aged 40 and increasingly bothered by lumbago, Yardley retired from the team. He ended his first class career with 18,173 runs at an average of 31.17, and 279 wickets at an average of 30.48. Wisden later described him as the finest Yorkshire amateur since F. S. Jackson . Yardley had a good technique for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen. Yardley worked as a wine merchant outside cricket. After his retirement from playing he worked as a cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on Test Match Special from 1956 until 1969, as well as in 1973. According to David Frith, the only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when Brian Close was dismissed after a poor shot in the Fourth Test in 1961 at Old Trafford this was part of a final day England collapse that handed Australia the match and a 21 series win after the hosts had been on course for victory and the series lead. Trevor Bailey, who was a colleague in the commentary box for the later part of Yardley's time with Test Match Special, wrote I always considered Norman Yardley to be an ideal summariser accurate, informative and very sensible, and able to explain not only what happened but also the reasons why. His knowledge about pitches, tactics and the technicalities of the game was exceptional... Articulate, expert, and possessing considerable charge , I thought his interpretation of events on the field and his post session summaries were sound, balanced and never less than fair. He served on the Yorkshire Cricket Committee, and from 1981, he was Yorkshire President. However, he became involved in the controversy surrounding Geoffrey Boycott, to whom the committee had decided not to give a new contract. Yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence, dismayed by the attitude of Boycott's supporters. Anthony Woodhouse wrote in his history of Yorkshire he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner. Alas, he should never have been burdened with the politics of Yorkshire cricket in the 1980s. He died at Lodge Moor, Sheffield on 3 October 1989 following a stroke.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman%20Yardley
"The Yarkand hare Lepus yarkandensis is a species of mammal in the family Leporidae. It has soft, straight, sandy brown dorsal pelage which has grayish black stripes, and completely white ventral pelage. Endemic to China, the Yarkand hare is restricted to the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, China. It is mainly nocturnal, and forages on grass and crops. The female produces two or three litters annually, each consisting of two to five young. It is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Endangered Species and by the Red List of China's Vertebrates. However, Chinese geneticists have stated the species is endangered due to limited habitat and its fragmentation, and over hunting and poaching. In 1875, the German zoologist Albert Karl Ludwig Gotthilf Gunther first described the Yarkand hare, giving it the name Lepus yarkandensis, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Gureev in 1964 and also by Averianov in 1998 placed the species in the subgenus Tarimolagus. It has no recognized subspecies. Low gene flow and genetic subdivision occurs among isolated populations of the Tarim Basin. The analysis of mitochondrial D loop sequence has shown that significant genetic divergence was observed among some populations, but not much genetic divergence was observed among other populations. In the populations inhabiting the southern periphery of the Taklamakan Desert, a lower level of genetic diversity was found. It is thought that the pattern of lineage mixing shown by the mitochondrial Cytochrome b DNA data could be due to the extensive gene flow among the Yarkand hare populations. It could be explained by the probable demographic expansion of the species during the late Pleistocene interglacial period. The eastern and northern distribution ranges may have undergone three postglacial colonizations. It is a small hare, measuring 285 to 430 mm 11.2 to 16.9 in in length, and weighs 1.1 to 1.9 kg 2.4 to 4.2 lb . The skull is small, measuring 76 to 88 mm 3.0 to 3.5 in in length. It has narrow nasal cavities with their back portions being straight and flat. The supraorbital process is low and flat, or are slightly curved upward. The auditory bullae are round and tall, and the palatal bridge is narrow. It has soft, straight, sandy brown dorsal pelage which has grayish black stripes, and completely white ventral pelage. It has long ears, measuring 90 to 110 mm 3.5 to 4.3 in in length, which lacks black at the tips. The winter pelage is lighter in tone, and is light sandy brown above. The underparts are white. The tail is 55 to 86 mm 2.2 to 3.4 in long, and is smoke gray in colour, having whitish or creamy yellowish white below and along the sides. The upper incisors are filled with cement, and have V shaped grooves. The forefeet are very pale and are brown at the front, and the hindfeet are paler, brown at the front too, and measure 90 to 110 mm 3.5 to 4.3 in in length. It is distinguished from the desert hare Lepus tibetanus , by its lack of black near the tip the peripheries of the ears. It is also distinguished from the Lepus oiostolus pallipes, by its lack of grey at the rump. It is also smaller in size and has thinner legs, than both the desert hare and the Lepus oiostolus pallipes. The species is easily distinguishable from other Chinese hares, having longer ears than the South Chinese hare. Like the woolly hare Lepus oiostolus and the South Chinese hare, an examination of the skull shows the groove on the front face of the upper incisors is filled with cement. Endemic to China, the Yarkand hare is restricted to the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, China. Its complete distribution, according to Angermann, falls in between 36 N and 42 N latitudes, and 76 E and 92 E longitudes. It prefers basins and desert areas vegetated with Chinese tamarisk Tamarix chinensis , brush, or poplar Populus , along the peripheries of rivers that surround the mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin. However, in 2010 Y.H. Wu of the Chinese Academy of Science flatly writes that the species is endangered due primarily to its fragmented and isolated islands of population. As Professor Wu wrote The Yarkland hare is an endangered species. ... is distributed in scattered oases which are physically isolated by desert. Thus, its natural fragmented habitat makes it an ideal object for study effect of habitat fragmentation on its genetic structure. It is a mainly nocturnal species, generally out in early morning or late evening, but may also feed at night. It hides in depressions, under vegetation, during the day. Foraging on grass and crops, the hare uses traditional foraging routes which can be 1 to 2 km 0.62 to 1.24 mi long. Breeding season begins in February and can be seven to eight months long, extending up to September. The female produces two or three litters annually, each consisting of two to five young. Although there is no information on its home range, a high population density was previously inferred. In 1983, Gao recorded that in three hours observing in the field, four people could find 20 or more Yarkand hares. Their main predator is the eagle. Since 1996, it has been rated as a near threatened species on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it has a restricted area of occupancy although it is a widespread species and has been reported as commonly found within its distribution. Additionally, its population trends, declining about 30 , warrants it a near threatened status, nearly meeting the criteria to be rated as vulnerable. It is hunted as a game species and, between 1958 and 1981, annually about 10,000 furs were produced from the Yarkand hare. Human activities such as transportation development and petroleum exploration has led to the population decline of the species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed it as near threatened, and earlier it had been regionally listed as vulnerable. It occurs in the Aerjinshan, Luobupoyeluotuo, and Talimuhuyanglin Nature Reserves. As the IUCN report notes However, increased human activity within its range is undoubtedly impacting this species negatively. At present, there are no data available to quantify ongoing population decline. It is assumed that declines are moderate approximately 30 and is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened nearly qualifying for listing as Vulnerable VU under A2cd. The species occurs only in the widely spaced oases that surround the Tarim making it highly fragmented the majority of the desert has no water or vegetation. More data are needed on the actual population level of L. yarkandensis in the oases that define its AOO, as well as whether or not the species is currently poached for food or pelts. Although it was regionally classified as VU under criteria A1cd Wang and Xie 2004 a better criterion A2 was preferred, as the cause s of decline have not ceased and are expected to continue in the future. The synergy of habitat loss, habitat patchiness and unsustainable harvest are cause for conservation concern. As indicated previously, Chinese researchers think it is endangered.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkand%20hare
"Yarmouth Castle is an artillery fort built by Henry VIII in 1547 to protect Yarmouth Harbour on the Isle of Wight from the threat of French attack. Just under 100 feet 30 m across, the square castle was initially equipped with 15 artillery guns and a garrison of 20 men. It featured an Italianate arrow head bastion on its landward side this was very different in style from the earlier circular bastions used in the Device Forts built by Henry and was the first of its kind to be constructed in England. During the 16th and 17th centuries the castle continued to be maintained and modified the seaward half of the castle was turned into a solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort's gunners. A bulwark was built on the east side of the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to the west. For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s. The fortification remained in use through the 18th and 19th centuries, albeit with a smaller garrison and fewer guns, until in 1885 these were finally withdrawn. After a short period as a coast guard signalling post, the castle was brought back into military use during the First and Second World Wars. In the 21st century, the heritage organisation English Heritage operates the castle as a tourist attraction. Yarmouth Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale. In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England. Henry responded in 1539 by ordering the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast, through an instruction called a device . The immediate threat passed, but resurfaced in 1544, with France threatening an invasion across the Channel, backed by her allies in Scotland. Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. The town of Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight may have been attacked by the French in 1543 if so, this raid probably encouraged the construction of a castle there as part of the second wave of Device Forts. The fort functioned alongside the existing defences in the Solent and protected the main crossing from the west side of the island to the mainland. Yarmouth Castle was a square artillery fort built around a central courtyard with an angular, arrow head bastion protecting the landward side. It was initially equipped with three cannons and culverins, and twelve smaller guns, firing from a line of embrasures along the seaward side of the castle. It was garrisoned by a small team of soldiers, consisting of a master gunner, a porter and 17 soldiers, commanded by Richard Udall, the castle's first captain. Udall lived in the castle, but the soldiers resided in the local town. The castle was constructed by George Mills under the direction of Richard Worsley, the Captain of the Island, on land belonging to the Crown, possibly on the site of a church destroyed during the events of 1543. Henry had dissolved the monasteries in England a few years before, and stone from the local Quarr Abbey was probably reused in the construction of the castle. It was finished by 1547, when Mills was paid 1,000 for his work and to discharge the soldiers who had been guarding the site during the project. When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to the throne there were changes in the leadership on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 for his role in the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing 50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs. Yarmouth Castle continued to be an important military fortification, used both as a fortress but also as a transport hub and a stores depot. The repairs recommended in 1599 were carried out in the first years of the 17th century and a further 300 was invested in Yarmouth Castle and nearby Sandown Castle in 1609, including adding two angular buttresses along the walls facing the sea. A survey in 1623 by the castle's captain, John Burley, reported that the garrison comprised only four gunners and the captain, with the buildings in a ruinous state and the defences in need of repair similar concerns were raised in 1625 and 1629. Suggestions that a half moon battery should be added to the defences were not progressed, but in 1632 the parapets were raised in height and further lodgings and a long room for stores were constructed within the castle. Some of the stone used for this may have been reused from nearby Sandown, whose walls had been destroyed by the sea before it was used at Sandown, the stone appears to have been taken from the local monasteries. Civil war broke out in 1642 between the followers of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Initially, Captain Barnaby Burley, a relative of John, and an ardent Royalist, held the castle on behalf of the King with a tiny garrison. Burley negotiated surrender terms, including that he initially be allowed to remain in the castle with armed protection, and the castle remained in the control of Parliament for the rest of the war. Early during the Interregnum it was decided to increase the size of the garrison at the castle from 30 to 70 soldiers, due to concerns about a potential Royalist attack from the island of Jersey. Most of the soldiers lived outside the castle itself. The annual cost of this force was around 78 and in 1655 the garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle. The King announced that the castle's artillery would be sent to Cowes, unless the town of Yarmouth agreed to take over the financial responsibility of running the site themselves. The town declined to do so, but Charles repeated the offer in 1666 this time Yarmouth seems to have taken action, appointing four soldiers for a garrison, although the town did not assign an officer to command them, or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle. The Crown took over the castle again in 1670, and Robert Holmes, the new Captain of the Isle of Wight, had some of the guns brought back from Cowes to the castle. The site was refortified and a new battery placed on the adjacent quay, but the older earthworks were demolished and the moat was filled in. Holmes built a mansion for himself alongside the castle, where on three occasions he hosted the King. In 1688, Charles' brother, James II, faced widespread revolt and a potential invasion of England by William of Orange. Holmes was a supporter of James, but although he intended to control Yarmouth Castle on the monarch's behalf, the local inhabitants and the garrison at Yarmouth sided with William, preventing him from openly siding with the King. Yarmouth Castle continued to be used, and records from 1718 and 1760 show it was equipped with eight 6 pound 2.7 kg and five 9 pound 4.1 kg guns along the castle and the quay platforms, respectively. Throughout this period it was probably staffed by a captain and six gunners, supported by the local militia. In the early 18th century, Holmes' mansion was rebuilt, forming its current appearance. By the 18th century, however, Yarmouth Harbour had gradually silted up and been destroyed by industrial developments, reducing the value of the anchorage, and the design of the castle had become outdated. In 1813, during the Napoleonic Wars, work was carried out to alter the design of the parapet. The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified. Yarmouth Castle underwent considerable repairs that year four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on the castle platform, and a regular county army unit was put in place to garrison the fort. In 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise the entire fortification, but this was rejected and in 1885 the garrison and the guns were withdrawn. The coastguard began using the castle as a signalling station in 1898. In 1901, the War Department passed the castle to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and in 1912 parts of the castle were leased to the Pier Hotel, which incorporated Robert Holmes's former mansion the Pier Hotel eventually became the George Hotel and still occupies part of the old castle moat. The Office of Works took control of the castle in 1913, carrying out a programme of repairs, and it was used by the military in both the First and Second World Wars. It was finally retired from military use in the 1950s. In the 21st century, Yarmouth Castle is run by the heritage organisation English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 9,007 visitors in 2010. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument. Yarmouth Castle is a square fortification, nearly 100 feet 30 m across, with an arrow head bastion protecting the landward side. The north and west walls face the sea, protected by angular buttresses, and a 10 metre 33 ft wide moat originally protected the south and east side, although this has since been filled in. The castle's 16th century bulwark, which originally covered the area to the west of Pier Street and the north of Quay Street, and its quay battery have also been destroyed. The walls of the castle are mainly built from ashlar stone, with some red brick used on the south side. The walls are pierced by a small number of gunloops, including in the ears of the bastion, which would have overlooked the moat. When first built the interior of the castle formed a sequence of buildings around a courtyard, but the southern half of the castle was filled in shortly afterwards to produce a solid gun platform able to support heavy guns. It was later raised again in the 17th century to its current height. The parapet is now covered with turf, with 19th century rounded corners, and the platform still has the rails on which the four naval guns would have traversed, dating from 1855. A small lodging room, built on the platform at the top of the stairs, has since been destroyed. The arrow head design of the castle's bastion reflected new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth was among the first fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design. The accommodation and other facilities are on the south side of the castle. On the ground floor, the entrance to the castle leads through to a courtyard, linked to four barrel vaulted rooms in the south west corner, originally 17th century lodgings for the garrison. Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south east corner is the Master Gunner's House, comprising a parlour, hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic on the floors above. The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel vaulted chambers, its massive, original roof still intact.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmouth%20Castle
"The Levant Egypt North Africa Anatolia Constantinople Border conflicts Sicily Southern Italy Naval warfare Byzantine reconquest Ridda Wars Conquest of the Persian Empire Conquest of Roman Syria Campaigns in Armenia and Anatolia The Battle of Yarmouk was a major battle between the army of the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The battle consisted of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what are now the borders of SyriaJordan and SyriaIsrael, east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory that ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history, and it marked the first great wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant. To check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive expedition to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where, they were reinforced and defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle is considered to be one of Khalid ibn al Walid's greatest military victories and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history. In 610, during the ByzantineSasanian War of 602628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, after overthrowing Phocas. Meanwhile, the Sasanian Empire conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia, occupying Caesarea Mazaca now Kayseri, Turkey . In 612, Heraclius managed to expel the Persians from Anatolia but was decisively defeated in 613 when he launched a major offensive in Syria against the Persians. Over the following decade, the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt. Meanwhile, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army. In 622, Heraclius finally launched his offensive. After his overwhelming victories over the Persians and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia, Heraclius launched a winter offensive against the Persians in Mesopotamia in 627, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon. Discredited by the series of disasters, Khosrow II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II, who immediately sued for peace and agreed to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire. Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629. Meanwhile, there had been rapid political development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and, by 630, had successfully annexed most of Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was chosen as caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, and several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In what became known as the Ridda wars of 632633, Abu Bakr managed to defeat his opponents and unite Arabia under the central authority of the caliph at Medina. Once the rebels had been subdued, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest, beginning with Iraq. Sending his most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al Walid, Iraq was conquered in a series of successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr's confidence grew, and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well co ordinated military operations, which employed strategy, instead of pure strength, to deal with the Byzantine defensive measures. The Muslim armies, however, soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July 634, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September 634, followed by the Battle of Fahl in which the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed. After Abu Bakr died in 634, his successor, Umar, was determined to continue the Caliphate's expansion deeper into Syria. Though previous campaigns led by Khalid had been successful, he was replaced by Abu Ubaidah. Having secured southern Palestine, Muslim forces now advanced up the trade route, and Tiberias and Baalbek fell without much struggle and conquered Emesa early in 636. The Muslims then continued their conquest across the Levant. Having seized Emesa, the Muslims were just a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter according to traditions, his granddaughter Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what was meant to be a well coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not co ordinate with the maneuver, probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government, and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark. Byzantine preparations began in late 635 and by May 636 Heraclius had a large force concentrated at Antioch in Northern Syria. The assembled Byzantine army contingents consisted of, Slavs, Franks, Georgians, Armenians and Christian Arabs. The force was organized into five armies, the joint leader of which was Theodore Trithyrius. Vahan, an Armenian and the former garrison commander of Emesa, was made the overall field commander, and had under his command a purely Armenian army. Buccinator Qanatir , a Slavic prince, commanded the Slavs and Jabalah ibn al Aiham, king of the Ghassanid Arabs, commanded an exclusively Christian Arab force. The remaining contingents, all European, were placed under Gregory and Dairjan. Heraclius himself supervised the operation from Antioch. Byzantine sources mention Niketas, son of the Persian general Shahrbaraz, among the commanders, but it is not certain which army he commanded. The Rashidun army was then split into four groups one under Amr in Palestine, one under Shurahbil in Jordan, one under Yazid in the Damascus Caesarea region and the last one under Abu Ubaidah along with Khalid at Emesa. As the Muslim forces were geographically divided, Heraclius sought to exploit that situation and planned to attack. He did not wish to engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III, probably to tie down Yazid's forces, which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria in the middle of June 636. The Byzantine imperial army was to operate under the following plan The Muslims discovered Heraclius' preparations at Shaizar through Roman prisoners. Alert to the possibility of being caught with separated forces, which could be destroyed, Khalid called for a council of war and advised Abu Ubaidah to pull the troops back from Palestine and Northern and Central Syria and then to concentrate the entire Rashidun army in one place. Abu Ubaidah ordered the concentration of troops in the vast plain near Jabiyah, as control of the area made cavalry charges possible and facilitated the arrival of reinforcements from Umar so that a strong, united force could be fielded against the Byzantine armies. The position also benefited from close proximity to the Rashidun stronghold of Najd, in case of retreat. Instructions were also issued to return the jizya tribute to the people who had paid it. However, once concentrated at Jabiyah, the Muslims were subject to raids from pro Byzantine Ghassanid forces. Encamping in the region was also precarious as a strong Byzantine force was garrisoned in Caeseara and could attack the Muslim rear while they were held in front by the Byzantine army. On Khalid's advice the Muslim forces retreated to Daraah or Dara and Dayr Ayyub, covering the gap between the Yarmouk Gorges and the Harra lava plains, and established a line of camps in the eastern part of the plain of Yarmouk. That was a strong defensive position, and the maneuvers pitted the Muslims and Byzantines into a decisive battle, which the latter had tried to avoid. During the maneuvers, there were no engagements except for a minor skirmish between Khalid's elite light cavalry and the Byzantine advance guard. The battlefield lies in the plain of Jordanian Hauran, just southeast of the Golan Heights, an upland region currently on the frontier between Jordan and Syria, east of the Sea of Galilee. The battle was fought on the plain south of Yarmouk River. That ravine joins the Yarmouk River, a tributary of the Jordan River, on its south. The stream had very steep banks, ranging from 30 m 98 ft 200 m 660 ft in height. On the north is the Jabiyah road and to the east are the Azra hills although the hills were outside the actual field of battle. Strategically, there was only one prominence in the battlefield a 100 m 330 ft elevation known as Tel al Jumm'a, and for the Muslim troops concentrated there, the hill gave a good view of the plain of Yarmouk. The ravine on the west of the battlefield was accessible at a few places in 636 AD, and had one main crossing a Roman bridge Jisr ur Ruqqad near 'Ain Dhakar Logistically, the Yarmouk plain had enough water supplies and pastures to sustain both armies. The plain was excellent for cavalry maneuvers. Most early accounts place the size of the Muslim forces between 24,000 and 40,000 and the number of Byzantine forces between 100,000 and 400,000. Modern estimates for the sizes of the respective armies vary the vast majority of estimates for the Byzantine army are between 80,000 and 150,000, while other estimates are as low as 15,000 to 20,000. Estimates for the Rashidun army are between 25,000 and 40,000. Original accounts are mostly from Arab sources, generally agreeing that the Byzantine army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizeable margin. The only early Byzantine source is Theophanes, who wrote a century later. Accounts of the battle vary, some stating it lasted a day, others more than a day. During a council of war, the command of the Muslim army was transferred to Khalid by Abu Ubaidah, Commander in Chief of the Muslim army. After taking command, Khalid reorganized the army into 36 infantry regiments and four cavalry regiments, with his cavalry elite, the mobile guard, held in reserve. The army was organised in the Tabi'a formation, a tight, defensive infantry formation. The army was lined up on a front of 12 kilometres 7.5 mi , facing west, with its left flank lying south on the Yarmouk River a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began. The army's right flank was on the Jabiyah road in the north across the heights of Tel al Jumm'a, with substantial gaps between the divisions so that their frontage would match that of the Byzantine battle line at 13 kilometres 8.1 mi . The centre of the army was under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah left centre and Shurahbil bin Hasana right centre . The left wing was under the command of Yazid and the right wing was under Amr ibn al A'as. The centre, left and right wings were given cavalry regiments, to be used as a reserve for counterattack if they were pushed back by the Byzantines. Behind the centre stood the mobile guard under the personal command of Khalid. If Khalid was too occupied in leading the general army, Dharar ibn al Azwar would command the mobile guard. Over the course of the battle, Khalid would repeatedly make critical and decisive use of that mounted reserve. Khalid sent out several scouts to keep the Byzantines under observation. In late July 636, Vahan sent Jabalah with his lightly armoured Christian Arab forces to reconnoiter in force, but they were repulsed by the mobile guard. After the skirmish, no engagement occurred for a month. Helmets used included gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid empire. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck, and cheeks as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armour included hardened leather scale or lamellar armour and mail armour. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen. Large wooden or wickerwork shields were used. Long shafted spears were used, with infantry spears being 2.5 m 8.2 ft long and cavalry spears being up to 5.5 m 18 ft long. Short infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used long swords were usually carried by horsemen. Swords were hung in baldrics. Bows were about 2 metres 6.6 ft long when unbraced, similar in size to the famous English longbow. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow was about 150 m 490 ft . Early Muslim archers, while being infantry archers without the mobility of horseback archer regiments, proved to be very effective in defending against light and unarmoured cavalry attacks. A few days after the Muslims encamped at the Yarmouk plain, the Byzantine army, preceded by the lightly armed Ghassanids of Jabalah, moved forward and established strongly fortified camps just north of the Wadi ur Ruqqad. The right flank of the Byzantine army was at the south end of the plains, near the Yarmouk River and about a mile before the ravines of Wadi al Allan began. The left flank of the Byzantines was at the north, a short distance before the Hills of Jabiyah began, and was relatively exposed. Vahan deployed the Imperial Army facing east, with a front about 13 kilometres 8.1 mi long, as he was trying to cover the whole area between the Yarmouk gorge in the south and the Roman road to Egypt in the north, and substantial gaps had been left between the Byzantine divisions. The right wing was commanded by Gregory and the left by Qanatir. The centre was formed by the army of Dairjan and the Armenian army of Vahan, both under the overall command of Dairjan. The Roman regular heavy cavalry, the cataphract, was distributed equally among the four armies, each army deploying its infantry at the forefront and its cavalry as a reserve in the rear. Vahan deployed Jabalah's Christian Arabs, mounted on horses and camels, as a skirmishing force, screening the main army until its arrival. Early Muslim sources mention that the army of Gregory had used chains to link together its foot soldiers, who had all taken an oath of death. The chains were in 10 man lengthsas a proof of unshakeable courage on the part of the men, who thus displayed their willingness to die where they stood and not to retreat. The chains also acted as an insurance against a breakthrough by enemy cavalry. However, modern historians suggest that the Byzantines adopted the Graeco Roman testudo military formation in which soldiers would stand shoulder to shoulder with shields held high and an arrangement of 10 to 20 men would be completely shielded on all sides from missile fire, each soldier providing cover for an adjoining companion. The Byzantine cavalry was armed with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow toxarion with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the shoulder across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armour consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant a throat guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armour. Light lamellar and scale armour was also used. Khalid's strategy of withdrawing from the occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end and there was a decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan had little choice but to respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir Buccinator . Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of the feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat. The battle lines of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections the left wing, the left centre, the right centre and the right wing. Note that the descriptions of the Muslim and the Byzantine battle lines are exactly each other's opposite the Muslim right wing faced the Byzantine left wing see image . Vahan was instructed by Heraclius not to engage in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored., probably because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, but their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, with a similar end. The negotiations delayed the battles for a month. On the other hand, Umar, whose forces at Qadisiyah were threatened with confronting the Sassanid armies, ordered Sa d ibn Abi Waqqas to enter negotiations with the Persians and to send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam Farrokhzad, apparently inviting them to Islam. That was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. The force included 1,000 Sahaba companions of Muhammad , among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah. Also present were such distinct companions as Sa'id ibn Zayd, Fadl ibn Abbas, Abdul Rahman ibn Abi Bakr the son of Abu Bakr , Abdullah ibn Umar the son of Umar , Aban ibn Uthman the son of Uthman , Abdulreman ibn Khalid the son of Khalid , Abdullah ibn Ja'far the nephew of Ali , Ammar ibn Yasir, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Dharr al Ghifari, Malik al Ashtar, Abu Ayyub al Ansari, Qays ibn Sa'd, Hudhayfah ibn al Yaman, Ubada ibn as Samit, Hisham ibn al A'as, Abu Huraira and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. As it was a citizen army, in contrast to a mercenary army, the age of the soldiers ranged from 20 in the case of Khalid's son to 70 in the case of Ammar . Three of the ten companions promised paradise by Muhammad, namely Sa'id, Zubayr and Abu Ubaidah, were present at Yarmouk. Umar, apparently wanting to defeat the Byzantines first, used the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided that they had no choice but to attack. The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements to demoralize the Byzantines to compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah. The battle began on 15 August 636. At dawn, both armies lined up for battle less than a mile apart. It is recorded in Muslim chronicles that before the battle started, George, a unit commander in the Byzantine right centre, rode up to the Muslim line and converted to Islam he would die the same day fighting on the Muslim side. The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim mubarizun. The mubarizun were specially trained swordsmen and lancers, with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale. At midday, after losing a number of commanders in the duels, Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and, using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority, achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak. However the Byzantine assault lacked determination many Byzantine soldiers were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans. The fighting was generally moderate although in some places, it was especially intense. Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry, two thirds of which was kept in reserve with one third deployed to engage the Muslims, and at sunset, both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps. Phase 1 On 16 August 636, Vahan decided in a council of war to launch his attack just before dawn, to catch the Muslim force unprepared as they conducted their morning prayers. He planned to engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre in an effort to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then be driven away from the battlefield or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack. However, Khalid had prepared for such a contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims time to prepare for battle. At the centre, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the centre remained stable, but on the wings the situation was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank, which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp. Phase 2 Khalid, aware of the situation at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing, and the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round. The situation on the Muslim left wing, which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. The Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard but not the left wing, and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. There, the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps and for a moment Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken though morale was severely damaged. The retreating Muslim army was met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps. Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents, and armed with tent poles, charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud, which then had been directed against the Muslims. O you who run from a constant woman Who has both beauty and virtue And leave her to the infidel, The hated and evil infidel, To possess, disgrace and ruin. That boiled the blood of the retreating Muslims so much that they returned to the battlefield. Phase 3 After managing to stabilize the position on the right flank, Khalid ordered the mobile guard cavalry to provide relief to the battered left flank. Khalid detached one regiment under Dharar ibn al Azwar and ordered him to attack the front of the army of Dairjan left centre to create a diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation. At sunset, the central armies broke contact and withdrew to their original positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan and the failure of Vahan's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized, but Khalid's successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being smaller in number. On 17 August 636, Vahan pondered over his failures and mistakes of the previous day, where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks, but after initial success, his men were pushed back. What bothered him the most was the loss of one of his commanders. The Byzantine army decided on a less ambitious plan, and Vahan now aimed to break the Muslim army at specific points. He decided to press upon the relatively exposed right flank, where his mounted troops could maneuver more freely as compared to the rugged terrain at the Muslims' left flank. The junction was to be between the Muslim right centre, its right wing held by Qanatir's Slavs, to break them apart so that they would be fought separately. Phase 1 The battle resumed with Byzantine attacks on the Muslim right flank and right centre. After holding off the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, followed by the right centre. They were again said to have been met by their own women, who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize some distance from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack. Phase 2 Knowing that the Byzantine army was focusing on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left centre, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right centre struck at the Byzantines left centre at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk, the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had at the start of the battle. The fourth day was to prove decisive. Phase 1 Vahan decided to persist with the previous day's war plan as he had been successful in inflicting damage on the Muslim right. Qanatir led two armies of Slavs against the Muslim right wing and right centre with some assistance from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah. The Muslim right wing and right centre again fell back. Khalid entered the fray yet again with the mobile guard. He feared a general attack on a broad front, which he would be unable to repulse, and so ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings, respectively, to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army. Phase 2 Khalid divided his mobile guard into two divisions and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left centre, and the infantry of the Muslim right centre attacked from the front. Under the three pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking from the front and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing. As the Byzantine left centre retreated under three pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back. While Khalid and his mobile guard were dealing with the Armenian front throughout the afternoon, the situation on the other end was worsening. Byzantine horse archers had taken to the field and subjected Abu Ubaidah and Yazid's troops to intense archery preventing them from penetrating their Byzantine lines. Many Muslim soldiers lost their sight to Byzantine arrows on that day, which thereafter became known as the Day of Lost Eyes . The veteran Abu Sufyan is also believed to have lost an eye that day. The Muslim armies fell back except for one regiment, led by Ikrimah bin Abi Jahal, which was on the left of Abu Ubaidah's corps. Ikrimah covered the retreat of the Muslims with his 400 members of the cavalry by attacking the Byzantine front, and the other armies reorganized themselves to counterattack and regain their lost positions. All of Ikrimah's men were either seriously injured or dead that day. Ikrimah, a childhood friend of Khalid, was mortally wounded and died later in the evening. During the four day offense of Vahan, his troops had failed to achieve any breakthrough and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce for the next few days so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops, but Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer. Until now, the Muslim army had adopted a largely defensive strategy, but knowing that the Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now decided to take the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of the cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi ur Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry. There were however, some passages across the 200 metres 660 ft deep ravines of Wadi ur Raqqad in west, strategically the most important one was at Ayn al Dhakar, a bridge. Khalid sent Dharar with 500 cavalry at night to secure that bridge. Dharar moved around the northern flank of Byzantines and captured the bridge, a maneuver that was to prove decisive the next day. On 20 August 636, the final day of the battle, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force, he intended to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear. At the same time, he planned to push a determined attack to turn the left flank of the Byzantine army and drive them towards the ravine to the west. Phase 1 Khalid ordered a general attack on the Byzantine front and galloped his cavalry around the left wing of the Byzantines. Part of his cavalry engaged the Byzantine left wing cavalry while the rest of it attacked the rear of the Byzantine left wing infantry. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing pressed against it from the front. Under the two pronged attack, the Byzantine left wing fell back and collapsed and fell back to the Byzantine left centre, greatly disordering it. The remaining Muslim cavalry then attacked the Byzantine left wing cavalry at the rear while they were held frontally by the other half of the Muslim cavalry, routing them off the battlefield to the north. The Muslim right wing infantry now attacked the Byzantine left centre at its left flank while the Muslim right centre attacked from front. Phase 2 Vahan, noticing the huge cavalry maneuver of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, but was not quick enough. Before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and the flank while they were still moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate. Phase 3 With the Byzantine cavalry completely routed, Khalid turned to the Byzantine left centre, which already held the two pronged attack of the Muslim infantry. The Byzantine left centre was attacked at its rear by Khalid's cavalry and was finally broken. Phase 4 With the retreat of the Byzantine left centre, a general Byzantine retreat started. Khalid took his cavalry north to block the northern route of escape. The Byzantines retreated west towards Wadi ur Ruqqad, where there was a bridge at Ayn al Dhakar for safe crossing across the deep gorges of the ravines of Wadi ur Ruqqad. Dharar had already captured the bridge as part of Khalid's plan the night before. A unit of 500 mounted troops had been sent to block the passageway. In fact, that was the route by which Khalid wanted the Byzantines to retreat all along. The Byzantines were surrounded from all sides now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters but were smashed on the rocks below and still others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, many of the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in the battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in the battle, but they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit. Theodore Trithurios died on the battlefield, and Niketas managed to escape and reach Emesa. Jabalah ibn al Ayham also managed to escape and later briefly came to terms with the Muslims, but he soon defected to the Byzantine court again. Immediately after the operation was over, Khalid and his mobile guard moved north to pursue the retreating Byzantine soldier and found them near Damascus and attacked. Vahan, who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmouk, was probably killed in the ensuing fighting. Khalid then entered Damascus, where he was supposedly welcomed by the local residents, thus recapturing the city. When news of the disaster reached Heraclius at Antioch, the emperor was devastated and enraged. He blamed his wrongdoings for the loss, primarily referring to his incestuous marriage to his niece Martina. He would have tried to reconquer the province if he had the resources but now had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead, he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously and accepted the fact that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins of the people of the land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night. His ship supposedly set sail, and he bade a last farewell to Syria, Farewell, a long farewell to Syria, my fair province. Thou art an infidel's enemy's now. Peace be with you, O Syriawhat a beautiful land you will be for the enemy. Heraclius abandoned Syria with the holy relic of the True Cross, which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just to protect it from the invading Arabs. It is said that he had a fear of water, and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, he began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 63839, and Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated. In 639642 Muslims invaded and captured Byzantine Egypt, led by Amr ibn al A'as, who had commanded the right flank of the Rashidun army at Yarmouk. The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed their enemy to have the battlefield of his choosing. Even then, they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until the last day of the battle, conducted an essentially defensive campaign, suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a smaller force and needed all the men he could muster, he had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat that he had anticipated for the enemy army. Because of his leadership at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al Walid is considered one of the finest generals in history, and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changed the course of events wherever they appeared, and, then just as quickly, galloped away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field. Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did not manage to deal with the mounted force and use the sizable advantage of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never played a significant role in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks, and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, but that may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, but the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops. The original strategy of Heraclius, to destroy the Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed those qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out, on a small tactical scale, what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale. By rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces, Khalid was able to concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field temporarily to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan was never able to make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the terrain, which prevented large scale deployment. However, Vahan never attempted to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive five out of the six days, his battle line remained remarkably static. That stands in stark contrast to the very successful offensive plan, which Khalid carried out on the final by reorganising virtually all his cavalry and committing it to a grand manoeuvre, which won the battle.

"The Yarn Market in Dunster, Somerset, England was built in the early 17th century. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument. Dunster was an important market place in the Middle Ages particularly following the construction of Dunster Castle and the establishment of the Priory Church of St George. The market cross was probably built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain the importance of the village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. It still bears the damage caused by cannon fire in the Civil War. Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved to the outskirts of the village. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain. Dunster Castle stands on a site which has been fortified since the late Anglo Saxon period, signifying the importance of the area. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family. Dunster had become a centre for woollen and clothing production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a particular kind of kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely. A second market cross, known as the Butter Cross, which was built in the 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved to the outskirts of the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn Market is in the guardianship of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of the roof was changed to more closely resemble the appearance of the original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions. The octagonal building, which is 9.4 metres 31 ft in diameter, has a central stone pier which supports a heavy timber framework for the structure. The slate roof has a central wooden lantern topped by a weather vane. The roof is interrupted by a series of dormer windows. Around the periphery is a low wall and vertical timber supports. Some of the sills are stone and others timber. One of the roof beams has a hole in it, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War, when Dunster Castle was a besieged Royalist stronghold for five months under the command of Colonel Wyndham. Following the damage, it was restored in 1647 to its present condition by Francis Luttrell. The building was the inspiration for the Rest House, on Bournville Village Green in Birmingham, which was built in 1914 to commemorate the silver wedding anniversary of Mr and Mrs George Cadbury.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn%20Market%2C%20Dunster
"Yaropolk Izyaslavich died 1087 was a Knyaz prince during the eleventh century in the Kievan Rus' kingdom and was the King of Rus 10761078 . The son of Grand Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich by a Polish princess named Gertruda, he is visible in papal sources by the early 1070s but largely absent in contemporary Rus sources until his father's death in 1078. During his father's exile in the 1070s, Yaropolk can be found acting on his father's behalf in an attempt to gain the favor of the German emperors and the papal court of Pope Gregory VII. His father returned to Kiev in 1077 and Yaropolk followed. After his father's death Yaropolk was appointed Prince of Volhynia and Prince of Turov in 1078 by the new Grand Prince, his uncle Vsevolod. By 1085 Yaropolk had fallen into a state of enmity with the Grand Prince, and by extension the Grand Prince's son Vladimir Monomakh, forcing him to flee to Poland, his mother's homeland. He returned in 1086 and made peace with Monomakh but was murdered the same year on a journey to Zvenyhorod. He was remembered in Rus sources as extremely pious and generous to the church and is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Yaropolk was the son of Izyaslav Yaroslavich died 1078 , over king of the Rus', and Gertruda, daughter of the Polish Duke King Mieszko II Lambert died 1034 . Since the Kievan succession war of 10151019, the Polish ruler Boleslaw had taken an interest in Ruthenia Kievan Rus , hoping to gain control of the land of Red Ruthenia Czerwien Grody , seized by Vladimir the Great. Despite some initial success, the expedition of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich Boleslaw's son in law , Prince of Turov, on the Kievan throne. The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia Czerwien Grody very briefly, though that was recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich, Prince of Chernigov, in 1031. In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland to settle for a peaceful deal. Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian prisoners who had been in Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw. Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav. In 1054, Yaropolk became the son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's security were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great namely, the descendants of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich. In 1067, Vseslav rebelled in an attempt to overthrow Izyaslav and become Grand Prince himself, claiming the right as a great grandson of Vladimir the Great through Izyaslav Vladimirovich. Vseslav's attempt was unsuccessful, and ended in his imprisonment. Troubles for Izyaslav were to continue though. In 1068, Izyaslav's alleged negligence to the advances and incursions of the Cuman people Polovtsy after the defeat at the Battle of the Alta River led the citizens of Kiev to revolt Vseslav was released, and took the Kievan throne while Izyaslav fled to Boleslaw in Poland. With Polish assistance Izyaslav returned in May 1069, expelled Vseslav and retook the throne. This victory for Izyaslav secured the Kievan throne for the descendants of Yaroslav Vladimirovich, and thereafter the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich confined themselves to Polotsk where they reigned with semi independent status. Despite the successful exclusion of the Polotsk Rurikids, in 1073 Izyaslav was expelled from the Kievan throne by his brothers, Svyatoslav, Prince of Chernigov, and Vsevolod, Prince of Pereyaslavl. King Boleslaw was not as willing or able to assist Izyaslav this time around, and probably for this reason Izyaslav traveled further West at Mainz in early 1075, Izyaslav sought the aid of King Henry IV of Germany, but to no avail. Izyaslav sent Yaropolk to Rome to request aid from Pope Gregory VII. It is likely that while there Yaropolk made complaints about Boleslaw and about the money the latter had formerly seized from Izyaslav, as the pope subsequently issued a request that Boleslaw return it. Pope Gregory addressed a letter to Izyaslav, called Demetrius , King of the Russians , and to his queen Gertruda. The letter noted that Yaropolk, called Peter , had given his own as well as his father's fidelity to the pope, and that it had been requested that the kingdom of the Ruthenians be held of St Peter. Two papal legates were sent to Izyaslav, and Izyaslav was urged to give them his full co operation. It was only after Svyatoslav's death in late 1076 that Izyaslav was able to recover the status of Grand Prince. Vsevolod, who had previously fought against him, was appointed Prince of Chernigov and thus heir to the Kievan throne, explaining perhaps Vsevolod's lack of opposition. The Poles were persuaded by the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering his kingdom, and on July 15, 1077, Izyaslav re entered Kiev. Yaropolk is found aiding his father and his uncle Vsevolod in 1078, when Oleg Svyatoslavich and his brother Boris attempted to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod. Oleg had been allied to the Polovtsy, and with their help defeated Vsevolod in battle. Grand Prince Izyaslav and Yaropolk, as well as Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh, were able to reverse this result, and Oleg was forced to retreat to Tmutorokan. Grand Prince Izyaslav, Yaropolk's father, died as a result of the battle. The Primary Chronicle records that in 1078 before the death of Izyaslav, Yaropolk was ruling in Vyshhorod , a city north of Kiev, while his brother Svyatopolk ruled as Prince of Novgorod, and Vladimir Monomakh ruled as Prince of Smolensk. After his uncle Vsevolod had become Grand Prince, Yaropolk was given Vladimir in Volhynia and Turov, while Monomakh received Chernigov. Little is known for the following eight years, but by 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other. The laconic account of these developments in the Primary Chronicle makes the course of events far from transparent. Vasilko and Vladimir Rostislavich, two Galicia based princes unhappy with territorial settlement under Vsevolod, were said to have attempted to expel Yaropolk in 1084, but Grand Prince Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh drove these Rostislavchi away. Following this, a gift made by the Grand Prince to Davyd Igorevich, which included land in Volhynia and control of trade with the Byzantine Empire, is said to have made Yaropolk hostile to the Grand Prince. By 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other, and Vsevolod ordered his son, Vladimir Monomakh to march against Yaropolk. Lacking confidence in his own resources, Yaropolk fled Volhynia to Poland, leaving his followers and mother at Lutsk. Vladimir captured Lutsk and Yaropolk's family, attendants and treasure, and assigned his whole principality to Davyd Igorevich. In the following year Yaropolk returned and reportedly came to an agreement with Vladimir Monomakh, but nothing specific is known of the terms other than Yaropolk being reinstated. In 1087, Yaropolk was murdered. The circumstances of his murder are not clear, but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich, Prince of Peremyshl, and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich, Prince of Terebovl. His murderer was a man called Neradets, who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl the date given is November 22, 1087. His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church of St Peter, the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed. Yaropolk is said to have married to the German noble woman, Kunigunde, daughter of Otto, Margrave of Meissen. Whether by Kunigunde or not, Yaropolk had several children whose names have come into the record. A daughter Anastasia married her far relative Gleb Vseslavich, Prince of Minsk who was a member of the Polotsk branch of the Riurik's family. The Annalista Saxo records another daughter, and that she married Gunther, Count of Schwarzburg, though it does not mention her name. Three sons are known, namely, Yaroslav died 1102 , Viacheslav died 1104 and Vasilko. The fate of his descendants is as mysterious as his and only has some scarce records left. Embedded in the Primary Chronicle is a eulogy to Prince Yaropolk, and among the honors assigned to him, is that he was in the habit of assigning a tenth part of his wealth to the Mother of God . Probably due to his personal devotion to the papacy and to St Peter, Yaropolk established a new church of St Peter at the monastery of St Demetrios in the city of Kiev. He was said to have left all his wealth to the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev. The Primary Chronicle's eulogy is the first indication of saintly regard, and indeed today he is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day falling on the reported day of his death, November 22.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaropolk%20Izyaslavich

Gadot's performance received positive feedback, and several commentators requested she reprise the role in a future film. In Fast Furious 2009 , Gisele Yashar Gal Gadot is introduced as a liaison for drug trafficker Auturo Braga John Ortiz . She develops romantic feelings for Dominic Toretto Vin Diesel , but he rejects her advances. She advises him about the dangers involved in smuggling heroin across the MexicoUnited States border to complete a deal with Braga. The drug exchange results in an ambush instigated by Braga, with Toretto protecting Yashar. She helps Toretto by providing him with the location of Braga's hideout in Mexico. Yashar becomes part of Toretto's team as a weapons expert in the 2011 film Fast Five. She is later revealed to be an ex Mossad agent. She helps the team with a heist, during which she works closely with Han Lue Sung Kang , and the two develop a romantic relationship. Following the completion of the mission, Yashar and Lue are last shown speeding down the Autobahn, with Yashar sitting in his lap. At the start of Fast Furious 6 2013 , Yashar and Lue are living together in Hong Kong. Toretto recruits the couple to prevent a heist planned by Owen Shaw Luke Evans , which could potentially kill millions of people. For the mission Yashar draws on her Mossad experience with interrogation, weapons, and retrieval. While attempting to stop a plane, she is left hanging from the back of a Range Rover. Lue attempts to rescue her, but Adolfson Benjamin Davies , a member of Shaw's gang, uses the opportunity to try and kill him. Yashar lets go of Lue's hand to shoot Adolfson, and she falls to her death. Lue later kills Adolfson in revenge for Yashar's death. At the end of the film, Roman Pearce Tyrese Gibson says a blessing in Yashar's honor during grace. In the 2015 film Furious 7, a photo of Yashar is shown in Lue's personal belongings, and it is later placed in his coffin as part of his memorial service. In a deleted scene, it is revealed that Yashar had found Letty Ortiz Michelle Rodriguez after she was nearly killed by Fenix Calderon Laz Alonso and taken her to the hospital. Ortiz asked Yashar why she saved her, and Yashar responded Maybe you are the one saving me. Gisele Yashar was Gal Gadot's first major film role, and the actress felt that it had a major impact on her career. She said that her unsuccessful experiences when trying out for Bond girl Camille Montes in the 22nd James Bond film Quantum of Solace 2008 had led to other auditions, specifically the one for Yashar. Gadot was cast by American director Justin Lin. The actress said that her background in the military helped with the audition, explaining I think the main reason was that Justin really liked that I was in the Israeli military, and he wanted to use my knowledge of weapons. In 2017, Gadot also thanked Vin Diesel for his input over her selection for the role. Vanity Fair's Yohana Desta identified Yashar as a breakthrough part that gave Gadot some mainstream recognition . When discussing her initial response to The Fast and The Furious franchise, Gadot said We don't do those kind of movies , with those kind of standards . She performed her own stunts during the films, saying The adrenaline was just incredible and I enjoyed being able to do the stuff that in real life you can't. Gadot explained that she wanted to feel like a tough girl while shooting her scenes. For the character's return in Fast Furious 6, Gadot told Lin that she wanted Yashar to be more of a badass , and was given more stunt work for the film. Some of the stunts involved jumping from a moving motorcycle onto a Jeep, being suspended in a harness, and riding a Ducati Monster motorcycle. Media outlets also characterized Yashar through her sexuality Fuse's Bianca Gracie referred to her as sensual and intimidating , and The Stranger's Erik Henriksen called her a villainous seductress . Gisele Yashar has received a mixed response from film critics. Decider's Meghan O'Keefe praised Yashar as a new type of female character for The Fast and The Furious franchise, writing that she provided a more sophisticated, and unapologetically femme vibe when compared to the rougher Ortiz. O'Keefe responded positively to Yashar's use of her sexuality and femininity as a tactic to manipulate men, as well as to her romance and partnership with Lue. Nerdist News's Sydney Bucksbaum also identified the character's relationship with Lue as a highlight, writing that they became one of the most iconic couples from all the movies . Some commentators had a more negative response to the character. The A.V. Club's Tom Breihan felt that Yashar's transformation from a drug lord's envoy to a former Mossad agent and a badass killer was part of how the franchise gave implausible makeovers to certain characters. IndieWire's Kate Erbland included Yashar's death as an example of the franchise's poor treatment of women she explained that female characters, such as Yashar, primarily exist to round out the storylines of the films' male characters, often as love interests and are rarely brought into focus as individuals. Gadot's performance received positive feedback from critics. In a 2017 article, Heavy.com's Brendan Marrow listed Yashar as one of Gadot's best performances prior to her starring role as Wonder Woman in the 2017 film of the same name. OKeefe of Decider described Gadot and her character as the secret weapon of The Fast and The Furious franchise, praising the actress for her totally kickass contribution to the bonkers, high octane, super charged . O'Keefe described Gadot's performance as balanc unbridled badassery with unabashedly feminine charm . Joe Reid, also writing for Decider, recommended that Yashar should be revived for future installments of the franchise, but questioned if the producers could afford to have Gadot return for another film. Bucksbaum campaigned for the character's return, and wrote that she could likely be featured in a future film through a flashback sequence.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele%20Yashar
"Yasss Bish is a song recorded by American rapper Nicki Minaj for her third studio album The Pinkprint 2014 , which did not make the final cut. It was written by Minaj along with the song's producers, Joseph DaVinci Soulja Boy, who is also credited as a guest vocalist. The track was released through her official SoundCloud account as the album's third promotional single on May 3, 2014 following Lookin Ass and Chi Raq . Musically, Yasss Bish is a drill song with a trap beat. Its stripped back hip hop production encompasses intense Roland TR 808 drum hits, a sinister, echo y vocal loop, eerie shimmering synthesizers, foreboding snares, and the sound of church bells ringing in an ominous tone. Lyrically, Minaj addresses her detractors, and references several celebrities including Donald Sterling and Will and Jada Smith. Minaj performed the song live for the first time along with Soulja Boy on May 18, 2014 at the Power 106's Powerhouse, Minaj performed the song again on June 2 at Hot 97 Summer Jam 2014. In September 2013, Minaj began working on her third studio album, The Pinkprint 2014 . For the album, Minaj desired to return to her hip hop roots, calling the album's sound a continuation of The Re Up with a lot more . Minaj told MTV News that the sound of The Pinkprint would be next level and will have so much to talk about , saying I'm really excited and the people that have been working with me now, have been people that I haven't worked with before so it's like they're bringing a new sound to the album that I've never experimented with. In April 2014, Minaj posted a picture on Instagram of herself with Soulja Boy in a studio. Later that month, he posted a Vine of him singing the song's chorus. Originally, Joseph DaVinci Soulja Boy created the song's beat but according to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later came up with the idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of Yasss Bish to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took about a day for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word yasss When I watch 'RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and it makes us feel like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's just putting on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'. On May 3, 2014, Minaj posted the song on her official SoundCloud shortly after midnight. Musically, Yasss Bish has been described as a bouncy drill anthem with a trap beat. It features a stripped back hip hop production that encompasses intense Roland TR 808 drum hits, a sinister, echo y vocal loop, eerie shimmering synthesizers, foreboding snares, and the sound of church bells ringing in an ominous tone. Minaj's vocals in Yasss Bish have been described as melodic with a fierce message, while her rapping has been compared to the works of Southern hip hop group Migos. Several critics including Kyle Harvey of The Grio and Emma Goddard of Bustle noted the change in sound to be the beginning of a new image for Minaj. Harvey said the song continued her goal of shedding her image of a pop act, while Goddard said Although this song is definitely NSFW and it's completely improbable that we'll hear British sisters Sophia Grace and Rosie rapping her song anytime soon, Minaj has come back strong with a new image. Lyrically, she addresses her detractors and all those who don't believe in her. The song opens with Soulja Boy singing yasss bish repeatedly for thirty seconds before Minaj begins her rap with Me I'm just me Me I'm just real Me I'm that bitch that be footing the bill. In the line I don't fuck with you niggas I own the Clippers I own some homes I own my own liquor Minaj references ex Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was banned from the NBA after leaked recordings of him making racist comments were made public. She also mentions Will and Jada Smith in the lyrics Bitches can't beat me they ain't got the skill Eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill Look up to Jada I love her and Will. Upon release, Yasss Bish received positive reviews from music critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy named Yasss Bish one of the 10 tracks you need to hear , praising Minaj's vocal delivery, the inclusion of Soulja Boy, and the line Fix it, Jesus. Colin Joyce of Spin called the song an unbridled joy , and noted that while it may not be included on The Pink Print, the album would be lucky, however, to feature any track half as exuberant as this one. A writer for MTV News UK praised both the production and vocals on Yasss Bish , saying that Minaj's melodic vocals and fierce rap delivery were the best part of the song. Several critics noted a musical departure from the pop and dance pop stylings of her second studio album Pink Friday Roman Reloaded 2012 . MTV News writer Emilee Lindner said Yasss Bish found Minaj going back to her original sound, saying Nicki Minaj is letting her rapping speak for itself. She's left her colorful wigs, fancy robes and tutus behind along with the hyper pop production of some of her biggest hits and now she's getting back to her roots. Emma Goddard of Bustle praised the chemistry between the two rappers and saw the song as a change from the more upbeat sound found in Minaj's catalogue, which she credited with show her rapping prowess much more . Writing for The Source, Khari said of Yasss Bish sheds the wig and the excessive make up, we get the most gorgeous Nicki we've seen in her career. Now, she grabs Soulja Boy Joseph DaVinci for the hook and the beat. You guessed it, score again.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasss%20Bish
"Yasui v. United States, 320 U.S. 115 1943 was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the constitutionality of curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States, where Japanese Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti Japanese sentiment in the country. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the application of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the conviction of U.S. born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded the case to the district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui. On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded neighboring Poland, starting World War II. After two years of combat neutrality, the United States was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese Americans by issuing Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This executive order authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese Americans including a curfew from 8 00 pm to 6 00 am. Minoru Yasui was born in 1916 in Hood River, Oregon, where he graduated from high school in 1933. He then graduated from the University of Oregon in 1937, and that colleges law school in 1939. Yasui, U.S. Army reservist, then began working at the Japanese Consulate in Chicago, Illinois, in 1940, remaining there until December 8, 1941, when he then resigned and returned to Hood River. On March 28, 1942, he deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon, by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11 00 pm in order to test the curfews constitutionality. On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began presiding over the non jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew to make it to court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and 5,000 fine. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country. Yasui then appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. After arguments in the case were filed, the court certified two question to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court then ordered the entire case be decided by that court, removing the case from further consideration by the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on May 10 and May 11, 1943, with Charles Fahy arguing the case for the United States as Solicitor General . Mins defense team included E. F. Bernard from Portland and A. L. Wirin from Los Angeles. On June 21, 1943, the court issued its decision in the case along with the Hirabayashi v. United States case. Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone wrote the opinion of the court, and determined that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stones opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded returned the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances. Once the case returned to Judge Fee, he revised his earlier opinion to strike out the ruling that Yasui was no longer a United States citizen. Fee also removed the fine and reduced the sentence to 15 days, with the time already served. Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps. Korematsu v. United States was decided the next year and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. The decisions were questioned by legal scholars even before the war had ended. Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court at the time of the trial. On February 1, 1983, Yasui petitioned the Oregon federal district court for a writ of error coram nobis due to the discovery of the falsehoods promulgated by the Department of Justice. This writ is only available to people who have already completed their imprisonment, and can only be used to challenge factual errors from the case. Yasui claimed in his writ that the government withheld evidence at the original trial concerning the threat of a Japanese attack on the United States mainland. The court dismissed the original indictment and conviction against Yasui, as well as the petition for the writ on request by the government. Yasui, then appealed the decision to dismiss the petition, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds. However, the Ninth Circuit ultimately did vacate Hirabayashi's conviction, thereby impliedly vindicating Yasui as well. In 2011, the U.S. Solicitor General's office publicly confessed the Justice Department's 1943 ethical lapse in the Supreme Court. Minoru Yasui died on November 12, 1986. Lawyers who represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter dated January 13, 2014 to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr.. In light of the appeal proceedings before the U.S. Supreme in Hedges v. Obama, the lawyers asked Verrili to request the Supreme Court overrule its decisions in Korematsu 1943 , Hirabayashi 1943 and Yasui 1943 . If the Solicitor General should not make the request, the lawyers asked that the federal government to make clear the federal government does not consider the internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of individuals or groups without due process of law ... .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasui%20v.%20United%20States
"Minoru Min Yasui , Yasui Minoru, October 19, 1916 November 12, 1986 was an American lawyer from Oregon. Born in Hood River, Oregon, he earned both an undergraduate degree and his law degree at the University of Oregon. He was one of the few Japanese Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor who fought laws that directly targeted Japanese Americans or Japanese immigrants. His case was the first case to test the constitutionality of the curfews targeted at minority groups. His case would make its way to the United States Supreme Court, where his conviction for breaking curfew was affirmed. After internment during most of World War II, he moved to Denver, Colorado in 1944. In Denver, Yasui married and became a local leader in civic affairs, including leadership positions in the Japanese American Citizens League. In 1986, his criminal conviction was overturned by the federal court. In 2015, Senator Mazie K. Hirono nominated Yasui for the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States. On November 16, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that Yasui would receive a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Medal was presented to Lori Yasui in a White House ceremony November 24, 2015. Born in Hood River, Oregon, on October 19, 1916, Minoru Yasui was the son of Japanese immigrants Shidzuyo and Masuo Yasui. The third son of nine children born to this fruit farming family, he graduated from the local high school in Hood River in 1933. At the age of eight he spent a summer in Japan, and later was enrolled in a Japanese language school in Oregon for three years. Yasui went on to college after high school at the University of Oregon in Eugene. At the school Yasui earned a bachelor's degree from the school in 1937 and a law degree from the University of Oregon Law School in 1939. He also was a member of the United States Army's Reserve Officer Training Corps ROTC program at the university, earning a commission after graduation in 1937. ROTC was a requirement of all male students during this time period for the first two years of the four year program. Yasui was commissioned on December 8, 1937, as a second lieutenant in the Army's Infantry Reserve. After law school he passed the bar and began practicing law in Portland, Oregon in 1939. He found it hard to find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attaches at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941. Yasui returned to Hood River from Chicago after his father, Masuo Yasui, requested that he come home in order to report for military duty. After returning to Hood River, he tried to report for duty with the United States Army at the Vancouver Barracks in neighboring Washington, but was denied from serving on nine occasions. Masuo Yasui was arrested on December 13, 1941, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an enemy alien, and had his assets frozen. Min Yasui moved to Portland and opened a private law practice in order to help the Japanese Americans put their affairs in order. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, that allowed the military to set up exclusion zones, curfews, and ultimately the internment of Japanese Americans during the war. On March 28, 1942, Yasui deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland, by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11 00 pm in order to test the curfews constitutionality. He first asked an officer on the street to arrest him but was told to Run along home, sonny boy, and so he walked into the police station. Later, on bail, he learned that a grand jury had indicted him. After the notice was given for the Japanese to evacuate, Yasui notified the authorities that he had no intentions of complying, and went to his family's home in Hood River. This violated another law restricting travel of Japanese Americans, and authorities arrested him in Hood River. Yasui had consulted a friend in the FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal minds to try to test the legality of the orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee came to the conclusion that laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a 5000 fine. Yasui waited nine months for his chance in court for appeal. During this time he was incarcerated at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, and later sent to the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. When that chance finally came, the case went first to the Ninth Circuit briefly, but was then moved on to the Supreme Court. There the judges came to the conclusion that Yasui was still a U.S. citizen. After a few days on June 21, 1943, however, in Yasui v. United States, the court ruled unanimously that the government did have the authority to restrict the lives of civilian citizens during wartime, deciding the case as a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States. Yasui was sent back to Fee, who removed the fine and decided that the time already served was enough of a punishment. Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps. In 1944, Yasui was allowed to leave the internment camp in the summer and was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver, Colorado, in September 1944. There he passed the bar in June 1945, but was only admitted to practice law after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata, and they would have three daughters together, Iris, Holly, and Laurel. Living in Denver, Yasui became involved with community relations, serving on committee set up by the mayor, and later from 1959 to 1983 on the Commission on Community Relations. This commission dealt with race relations and other social issues, with Yasui as executive director from 1967 to 1983. In 1954, he was chairman of the Japanese American Citizens Leagues JACL district covering Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Montana. The Minoru Yasui Community Service Award was started in 1974 by Denver community leaders, and is awarded annually to Denver area volunteers. In 1976, Yasui began working on the JACLs committee concerning redress for the internment during World War II. He continued on that committee until 1984, serving as its chairman in 1981. He also filed in federal district court in Oregon a coram nobis to attempt to overturn his conviction in 1984. His conviction was overturned by the Oregon federal court in 1986. Minoru Yasui died on November 12, 1986, and is buried in his hometown of Hood River. The City and County of Denver owns an office building named after Yasui. Located at 303 West Colfax Avenue in Denver, the building is called Minoru Yasui Plaza, or the Minoru Yasui Building. A bronze bust of Yasui adorns the building's foyer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoru%20Yasui
"Yatton railway station, on the Bristol to Exeter Line, is in the village of Yatton in North Somerset, England. It is 12 miles 19 km west of Bristol Temple Meads railway station, and 130 miles 209 km from London Paddington. Its three letter station code is YAT. It was opened in 1841 by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, and served as a junction station for trains to Clevedon and Cheddar, but these lines closed in the 1960s. The station, which has two platforms, is managed by Great Western Railway, the seventh company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide all train services at the station, mainly hourly services between Bristol Parkway and Weston super Mare, and between Cardiff Central and Taunton. The line is not currently electrified, and there is local support for electrification as an extension of the Great Western Main Line upgrade programme. A community centre and cafe was opened at the station in 2011. The station is located in the north end of the village of Yatton, North Somerset, just west of the B3133 road between Clevedon and Congresbury. The station is on the Bristol to Exeter Line, 130 miles 28 chains 209.78 km from London Paddington and 11 miles 77 chains 19.25 km from Bristol Temple Meads. It is the fourth station along the line from Bristol. The station is oriented along an axis at 57 degrees to the meridian. There are two platforms, on either side of the two tracks through the station. The southern platform, platform 1, is 162 metres 177 yd long and serves westbound trains towards Weston super Mare the northern platform, platform 2, is 121 metres 132 yd long and serves eastbound trains towards Bristol . The line through the station has a speed limit of 100 miles per hour 160 km h . Access to the two platforms is step free from car parks on each side of the station, accessible via short roads from the B3133. There is an uncovered footbridge between the two platforms, but disabled passengers must go the long way round via the B3133. A ticket office is provided on platform 2, staffed every morning except Sundays. Ticket machines are available, allowing the buying of tickets for on the day travel, and collection of pre bought tickets. There are waiting rooms on both platforms, with toilets on platform 2, but none suitable for wheelchairs. Next train dot matrix displays and an automated public address system announce approaching services. There is a pay and display car park on each side of the station, with a total of 114 spaces. There are bus stops nearby on the B3133. Cycle storage is available on the access roads. The station is the start point for the Strawberry Line, a foot and cyclepath built mostly on old railway land to Axbridge. The start of the path is marked by a 6 metre high 20 ft arch. The Strawberry Line Cafe, run by a local community group, is located on platform 1, and is open most days from 7 30 am to serve commuters. Just beyond the station, to the west, are a pair of relief lines to allow slower trains to be overtaken. There are also some cross over points, allowing trains to terminate on the westbound relief line and then return eastwards. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who also operate all rail services from the station. The basic service consists of two trains in each direction per hour. One is the Bristol Parkway to Weston super Mare service, calling at all stations the second is the faster Cardiff Central to Taunton service, non stop between Bristol Temple Meads and Nailsea Backwell. Some westbound services are extended to Exeter St Davids or Plymouth. There is one service to Avonmouth on weekday evenings. Each Sunday there are two services to and from the Severn Beach Line. During summer months these terminate at Severn Beach the rest of the year only one does, the other terminating at Avonmouth. The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is 1620 minutes. The local services described above are formed using Class 150, 153, 158 and 166 diesel multiple unit trains. Services between London Paddington and Weston super Mare call at Yatton in the early morning and evening, running non stop between Bristol Temple Meads and Nailsea and Backwell. All such services also stop at Nailsea and Backwell, but not always at Worle or Weston Milton. From Monday to Friday there are five morning services and one evening service to London, with seven services from London, all in the evening. Saturday sees three services to London, all in the morning, and four services from London, all in the evening. There are seven services to and six from London on Sundays, spread throughout the day. These intercity services are formed of Class 800s, which are longer than the station, so passengers in the front carriage have to move to a different carriage to get out. Passengers are prevented from getting out onto the tracks by a selective door opening system. The typical journey time to London is 2 hours 10 minutes. In 2008, one morning northbound CrossCountry service would make a stop at Yatton to serve as a morning peak service, but this operation has ceased. CrossCountry services still pass through the station, but do not stop. Occasional Great Western Railway intercity services between London and Weston super Mare or Taunton and Exeter also pass through non stop. Bakers Dolphin number 66 bus from Nailsea to Congresbury via Portbury, Portishead, Clevedon and Yatton stops at the station, with seven services Monday to Saturday in each direction. There are also services connecting the station with local destinations towards Bristol and Weston super Mare operated by First West of England that leave from the main road outside the station. The first section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway's B ER main line opened on 14 June 1841 between Bristol and Bridgwater. Clevedon Road as it was then known was for a while the second station on the line west of Bristol, the first being Nailsea. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as 7 ft 2,134 mm broad gauge. The platform buildings at Yatton are of Brunel style, and it is widely believed Brunel himself designed the buildings. There were significant goods facilities, with a large goods yard and shed to the south of the station. A hotel was provided adjacent to the eastbound platform for people travelling to Clevedon. The station buildings themselves included a ticket office and station master's office on the eastbound platform. A bookstall was in operation from 1888. Services were initially operated by the Great Western Railway GWR on behalf of the Bristol Exeter. The station was originally built, as the original name suggests, to serve passengers for Clevedon, who would travel on by road. On 28 July 1847, the B ER opened a branch line between Yatton and Clevedon, and so renamed Clevedon Road station as Yatton. A bay platform was built on the north side of the station to accommodate branch traffic, with an unusual canopy which covered the entire bay, as well as the eastbound platform. The canopy included louvre ventilation. There was also a connection from the main line, albeit at a 10 miles per hour 16 km h speed limit, for the few direct trains from Bristol. This too was built to broad gauge. There were five services each weekday, and two on Sundays. These services were also operated by the Great Western Railway, until 1849 when the Bristol Exeter took over its own workings. By 1869 the number of weekday services had increased to nine. From 1867, Yatton was also served by coal trains for the local gasworks. Yatton became even more important on 3 August 1869 when the Bristol Exeter opened the broad gauge Cheddar Valley Railway, which became famous for the transport of strawberries from stations such as Axbridge and Cheddar. The line was extended to Wells on 5 April 1870, where it joined with the East Somerset Railway line from Witham, and through services from Yatton to Witham became normal for this line, with between five and seven services daily. To accommodate this new traffic, another bay platform was built, this time on the south side of the station. A canopy similar to the one for Clevedon trains was built for this bay, and for passengers at the end of the westbound platform. On 1 January 1876, the Bristol Exeter was amalgamated into the GWR, who took over the running of the station and services. In 1879, the Clevedon branch was converted to 4 ft 8 12 in 1,435 mm standard gauge. This followed a scheme throughout the GWR to convert its tracks from broad gauge to mixed gauge. The last GWR broad gauge train operated on 20 May 1892, after which all tracks were converted to standard gauge. The conversion of the Clevedon line coincided with the opening of an engine shed for branch traffic. A turntable for Cheddar Valley trains was built at around the same time. In 1889, there were 12 weekday trains along the Clevedon branch, and three on Sundays. By around 1900, there were between five and seven services operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail train on Sundays. Traffic was to increase from 1901 with the opening of the Wrington Vale Light Railway. Although this line joined the Cheddar Valley Line at Congresbury, most services continued to Yatton. In 1901 there were four passenger trains per day and one goods train, which increased to five passenger trains per day by 1903. The line was known for the transport of mushrooms. By 1910, there were 18 daily services along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut was built in the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two track pinch point. The Wrington Vale line closed in 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic to the gas works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either the number of tickets sold along the line had decreased dramatically since the early 1900s, although there was still a significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969. The Clevedon branch was seeing increased passenger traffic, up to 26 trains daily and 10 on Sundays by 1958, and in 1956 the unusual canopy was taken down, replaced by a second hand canopy from Dauntsey railway station. However, this uptick was not to last coal traffic along the line ended in 1951, and by 1963 there were no longer any freight workings. The line closed completely on 3 October 1966, taking the station's bookstall with it. The Claverham loops had been closed on 6 September 1964, and the goods yard at Yatton was closed on 29 November 1965. The now redundant bay platforms were converted into car parks, and the canopy on the westbound platform removed along with the two water towers. On 24 January 1972, the passing loops to the west of the station were cut back to 0.5 miles 0.80 km , and the station's signal box, which had had 129 levers, closed on 31 January the same year. British Rail was split into business led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Yatton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, a stop was added at Yatton for a Royal Mail train to provide a more direct link to Bristol Airport. The service was ended in 2004 when the post office stopped transporting mail by train. When the railways were privatised in 1997, local services at Yatton were franchised to Wales West, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, which was rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. There was somewhat of a revival of fortunes for the Cheddar Valley Line, which has been converted into a foot and cycle path. A 6 metre high 20 ft metal arch was erected in 2000 to mark the start of walk. The station buildings on the westbound platform have now been converted into the Strawberry Line Cafe, which opened in 2011, providing employment and training for people with learning disabilities, as well as snacks for commuters, walkers and local residents. The cafe suffered two break ins in 2017, with significant damage caused. In March 2005, Wessex Trains, the company managing the station at the time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005. The eastbound platform buildings were refurbished in 2005 to guard against rising damp. A year later, in 2006, replica Great Western Railway benches were provided by the National Trust. Hanging baskets were brought to the station in 2011 as a joint effort between the Severnside Community Rail Partnership, Cleve Nurseries and the station's garden group. On 7 May 1842, a steam locomotive ran away from its train without a driver whilst briefly decoupled at Yatton. The locomotive eventually came to a stop when it ran out of fuel approaching Bridgwater. First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise of which services at Yatton are a part beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. With the impending upgrade, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified. However, the electrification will not extend beyond Bristol to Weston super Mare, so Yatton will continue to be served by diesel trains. This could entail the removal of direct London services, as electric trains would not be able to operate beyond Bristol. Services could however continue using bi mode trains. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing to Weston, as does MP for Weston super Mare John Penrose. Local services will still be diesel operated, with Sprinter units expected to be replaced by Class 165 and 166 Turbo units. Yatton is on the Weston super Mare Yate corridor, one of the main axes of the Greater Bristol Metro, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance capacity in the Bristol area. The plan calls for longer and newer trains to prevent overcrowding. Yatton Parish Council has stated that adding a roof to the station footbridge is one of their priorities.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatton%20railway%20station
"Yavapai are a Native American tribe in Arizona. Historically, the Yavapai literally people of the sun from enyaeva sun pai people were divided into four geographical bands who identified as separate, independent peoples the o lkabaya, or Western Yavapai the Yavbe', or Northwestern Yavapai the Guwevkabaya, or Southeastern Yavapai and the Wi pukba, or Northeastern Yavapai Verde Valley Yavapai. Another Yavapai band, which no longer exists, was the Maqwadabaya or Desert People. Its people are believed to have mixed with the Mojave and Quechan peoples. Several Mohave and Quechan families trace their ancestry to Yavapai roots. The Yavapai have much in common with their linguistic relatives to the north, the Havasupai and the Hualapai. Often the Yavapai were mistaken as Apache by American settlers, who referred to them as Mohave Apache, Yuma Apache, or Tonto Apache . Before the 1860s, when settlers began exploring for gold in the area, the Yavapai occupied an area of approximately 20,000 mi2 51800 km2 bordering the San Francisco Peaks to the north, the Pinaleno Mountains and Mazatzal Mountains to the southeast, and the Colorado River to the west, and almost to the Gila River and the Salt River to the south. Before being confined to reservations, the Yavapai were mainly hunter gatherers, following an annual round, migrating to different areas to follow the ripening of different edible plants and movement of game. Some tribes supplemented this diet with small scale cultivation of the three sisters maize, squash, and beans in fertile streambeds. In particular, the o lkabaya, who lived in lands that were less supportive of food gathering, turned to agriculture more than other Yavapai. They had to work to cultivate crops, as their land was also less supportive of agriculture. In turn, o lkabaya often traded items such as animal skins, baskets, and agave to Quechan groups for food. The main plant foods gathered were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita berries and apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave was the most crucial harvest, as it was the only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors. The early Yavapai practiced traditional dances such as the Mountain Spirit Dance, War Dances, Victory Dances and Social Dances. The Mountain Spirit dance was a masked dance, which was used for guidance or healing of a sick person. The masked dancers represented Mountain Spirits, who were believed by Yavapai to dwell in Four Peaks, McDowell Mountains, Red Mountain near Fort McDowell , Mingus Mountain Black Hills near Camp Verde, and Granite Mountain near present day Prescott. The Yavapai also believe that the Mountain Spirits dwelled in the caves of Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well in the Verde Valley. The modern Yavapai take part in several dances and singing, such as the Apache Sunrise Dance and the Bird Singing and Dancing of the Mojave people. The Yavapai built brush shelter dwellings called Wa'm bu nya va Wom boo nya va . In summer, they built simple lean tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts called uwas would be built of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered with animal skins, grasses, bark, and or dirt. In the Colorado River area, o lkabaya built Uwa a'mava, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold. The Yavapai main social political organization were local groups of extended families, which were identified with certain geographic regions in which they resided. These local groups would form bands in times of war, raiding or defense. For most of Yavapai history, the family was the focal group, be it the nuclear family, or extended. This is partly because most food providing sites were not large enough to support larger populations. However, exceptions are known. Near Fish Creek, Arizona, was Ananyike Quail's Roost , a Guwevkabaya summer camp that supported upwards of 100 people at a time. It supported a prickly pear fruit harvest, and hunting of rabbits and woodrats. In winter, camps were formed of larger groups, consisting of several families. They separated into smaller groups at the end of winter, in time for the spring harvest. Government among the Yavapai tended to be informal. There were no tribal chiefs, such as Chief of the Guwevkabaya or Chief of the o lkabaya. Certain men became recognized leaders based on others choosing to follow them, heed their advice, and support their decisions. Men who were noted for their skills as warriors were called mastava not afraid or bamulva person who goes forward . Other warriors were willing to follow such men into combat. Some Yavapai men were noted for their wisdom and speaking ability. Called bakwauu person who talks , they would settle disputes within the camp and advise others on the selection of campsites, work ethics, and food production. The Yavapai peoples were not a political or social unit, but rather four separate autonomous groups. Although culturally, linguistically and ethnically related, they did not identify as Yavapai in a centralized way. These four groups were, for geographical, historical, cultural and familial reasons, in various alliances with neighboring tribes, without regard to the concerns of the adjacent Yavapai groups. The four groups consisted of different local groups, composed primarily of kinship groups known as clans. The Yavapai divided into subsequent four groups Both in the Walkamepa and Wikedjasapa, the following clans were represented and shared mostly overlapping territories The Wi pukba People from the Foot of the Red Rock and Guwevkabaya lived alongside the Dilzhee Apache Tonto Apache of central and western Arizona. The Tonto Apache lived usually east of the Verde River and most of the Yavapai bands lived west of it. The Wi pukba tribal areas in the San Francisco Peaks, along the Upper Verde River, Oak Creek Canyon and Fossil Creek, overlapped with those of the Northern Tonto Apache. Likewise the Guwevkabaya shared hunting and gathering grounds east of the Verde River, along Fossil Creek, East Verde River, Salt River and in the Superstition Mountains, Sierra Ancha and Pinaleno Mountains with Southern Tonto Apache and bands of the San Carlos Apache. Therefore they formed bilingual mixed tribal bands. Outsiders, such as the Spanish, Mexicans and Americans distinguished the peoples primarily by language, but often referred to them as one name. The Apache spoke the Tonto dialect of the Western Apache language Ndee biyati' Nnee biyati' , and the Yavapai spoke the Yavapai language, a branch of Upland Yuman. Living together in common rancherias, families identified as Apache or Yavapai based on their Mother tongue. Both groups had matrilineal kinship systems, with children considered born into the mother's family and clan, with inheritance and property figured through the maternal line. Most of the people in these mixed groups spoke both languages. The headman of each band usually had two names, one from each culture. Therefore the enemy Navajo to the north called both, the Tonto Apache and their allies, the Yavapai, Dilzhi dinei People with high pitched voices. The ethnic Europeans referred to the Yavapai and Apache together as Tonto or Tonto Apache. The peoples raided and warred together against enemy tribes such as the Tohono O'odham and the Akimel O'odham. Scholars cannot tell from records whether the writers of the time, when using the term Tonto Apache, were referring to Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. In addition, the Europeans often referred to the Wi pukba and Guwevkabaya incorrectly as the Yavapai Apache or Yuma Apache. The Europeans referred to the o lkabaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples , as Yuma Apache or Mohave Apache. Ethnological writings describe some major physical differences between Yavapai and Tonto Apache peoples. The Yavapai were described as taller, of more muscular build, well proportioned and thickly featured, while the Tonto Apache were slight and less muscular, smaller of stature and finely featured. The Yavapai women were described as stouter and having handsomer faces than the Yuma, in a historic Smithsonian Institution report. The Yavapai often acquired tattoos, but the Apache seldom used tattoos. They created different painted designs on faces. They also had different funeral practices. In clothing, Yavapai moccasins were rounded, whereas those of the Apaches were shaped with pointed toes. Both groups were hunter gatherers. They left campsites so similar that scholars are seldom able to distinguish between them. According to their creation story, the Yavapai believe that their people originated in the beginning, or many years ago, when either a tree, or a maize plant sprouted from the ground in what is now Montezuma Well, bringing the Yavapai into the world. Most archeologists agree that the Yavapai originated from Patayan groups who migrated east from the Colorado River region to become Upland Yumans. Archeological and linguistic evidence suggests that they split off to develop as the Yavapai somewhere around 1300 AD. Warfare was not uncommon in the Yavapai world, and they made changing alliances for security. Wi pukba Wipukepa and Guwevkabaya Kwevkepaya bands formed alliances with Western Apache bands, to attack and defend against raids by the Pima and Maricopa bands from the south. Because of the greater strength of the Pima Maricopa, Yavapai Apache raids generally conducted small scale quick raids, followed by a retreat to avoid counter attack. The Yavapai defended their lands against Pima incursions, when the Pima would invade to harvest saguaro fruits. To the north and northwest, Wi pukba and Yavbe' bands had off and on relations with the Pai people throughout most of their history. Though Pai and Yavapai both spoke Upland Yuman dialects, and had a common cultural history, each people had tales of a dispute that separated them from each other. According to Pai myth, the dispute began with a mudball fight between children. Scholars believe this split occurred around 1750 AD. The last big battle between the Colorado Gila River alliances took place in August 1857, when about 100 Yavapai, Quechan, and Mohave warriors attacked a settlement of Maricopa near Pima Butte. After overwhelming the Maricopa, the Yavapai left. A group of Pima, supplied with guns and horses from US troops, arrived and routed the remaining Mohave and Quechans. The first recorded contact with Yavapai was made by Antonio de Espejo, who was brought to Jerome Mountain by Hopi guides in 1583, looking for gold. De Espejo was disappointed to find only copper. In 1598, Hopi brought Marcos Farfan de los Godos and his group to the same mines, to their excitement. Farfan referred to the Yavapai as cruzados because of the crosses painted on their heads. A group led by Juan de Onate led another group through Yavapai lands in 1598, and again in 1604 5, looking for a route to the sea which Yavapai had told them about. After this, no other European contact was made for more than 200 years. In the intervening time, through contact with other tribes that had more European contact, the Yavapai began to adopt certain European practices. They raised some livestock and planted crops, also adopting some modern tools and weaponry. In a syncretic way, they adopted elements of Christianity. An estimated 25 of the population died as a result of smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, smaller losses than for some tribes, but substantial enough to disrupt their societies. With the use of guns and other weapons, they began to change methods of warfare, diplomacy, and trade. They used livestock raiding, either from other tribes such as the Maricopa, or from Spanish settlements to their south, to supplement their economy. They often acquired human captives in raids, whom they traded as slaves to Spaniards in exchange for European goods. In the 1820s, beaver trappers, having depleted the beaver population of the Rocky Mountains, began entering Yavapai territory. They trapped beaver along the Salt, Gila, and Bill Williams rivers. When Kit Carson and Ewing Young led a trapping group through the territory in 1829, the group was nightly harassed... Traps were stolen and some of their horses and mules killed. Following the declaration of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites. The first fighting between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors to defend against Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a group led by John Glanton, who had taken over the crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and taking control of the crossing. According to Thomas Sweeney, the Tolkepaya would tell US officers encountered in Quechan territory, that they had a 30 day march to their own territory. They wanted to discourage US encroachment on their land. In 1851, the Oatman family was ambushed by a group of tribal members, possibly o lkabaya Yavapai, though many historians argue that it is impossible to know. Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their seven children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves. The story was widely published, and increased white settlers' fears of attack in Arizona. When in early 1863, the Walker Party discovered gold in Lynx Creek near present day Prescott, Arizona , it set off a chain of events that would have White settlements along the Hassayampa and Agua Fria Rivers, the nearby valleys, as well as in Prescott, and Fort Whipple would be built, all by the end of the year, and all in traditional Yavapai territory. The Yavapai Wars, or the Tonto Wars, were a series of armed conflicts between the Yavapai and Tonto tribes against the United States in Arizona. The period began no later than 1861, with the arrival of American settlers on Yavapai and Tonto land. At the time, the Yavapai were considered a band of the Western Apache people due to their close relationship with tribes such as the Tonto and Pinal. 366 to 489 Yavapai where killed in massacres, and 375 perished in Indian Removal deportations out of 1,400 remaining Yavapai. After being relocated to the Camp Verde Reservation, on the Verde River near Camp Verde, the Yavapai there began to construct irrigation systems including a five mile 8 km long ditch that functioned well enough to reap sufficient harvests, making the tribe relatively self sufficient. But contractors that worked with the government to supply the reservations were disappointed, and petitioned to have the reservation revoked. The government complied, and in March 1875, the government closed the reservation, and marched the residents 180 miles 290 km to the San Carlos reservation. More than 100 Yavapai died during the winter trek. By the early 1900s, Yavapai were drifting away from the San Carlos Reservation, and were requesting permission to live on the grounds of the original Camp Verde Reservation. In 1910, 40 acres 161,874 m2 was set aside as the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, and in the following decade added 248 acres 1,003,620 m2 in two parcels, which became the Middle Verde Indian Reservation. These two reservations were combined in 1937, to form the Camp Verde YavapaiApache tribe. Today, the reservation spans 665 acres 2.7 km2 , in four separate locales. Tourism contributes greatly to the economy of the tribe, due largely to the presence of many preserved sites, including the Montezuma Castle National Monument. The YavapaiApache Nation is the amalgamation of two historically distinct Tribes both of whom occupied the Upper Verde prior to European invasion. The Tonto Apache, calling themselves Dilzhe'e, utilized the lands to the north, east and south while the Wi pukba' or Northeastern Yavapai were using country to the north, the west and the south. It was the Upper Verde where they overlapped. The Yavapai reservation in Prescott was established in 1935, originally consisting of just 75 acres 300,000 m2 of land formerly occupied by the Fort Whipple Military Reserve. In 1956, an additional 1,320 acres 5 km2 were added. Succeeding the tribe's first chief, Sam Jimulla, his wife Viola became the first female chieftess of a North American tribe. Today, the tribe consists of 159 official members. The population consist mainly of the Yavbe' Yavape Group of Yavapais. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation is located within Maricopa County approximately 20 miles northeast of Phoenix. The reservation came into existence when Theodore Roosevelt had Fort McDowell declared a 40 square miles 100 km2 reservation in 1903, but by 1910, the Office of Indian Affairs was attempting to relocate the residents, to open up the area, and water rights to other interests. A delegation of Yavapai testified to a Congressional Committee against this, and won. Today, the tribal community consists of 900 members, 600 of whom live on the reservation and the remaining 300 who live off the reservation. The Guwevkabaya or Southeastern Yavapai on Fort McDowell Reservation call themselves A'ba ja The People therefore some anthropologists and linguists believe, that the name Apache for the various Southern Athabascan peoples derives from the self designation of the Yavapai. The population of Fort McDowell consists of the Guwevkabaya Yavapai. Responding to growth in the Phoenix area, in the early 1970s Arizona officials proposed to build a dam at the point where the Verde and Salt Rivers meet. The dam would have flooded two thirds of the 24,000 acre 97 km2 reservation. In return, the members of the tribe at the time consisting of 425 members were offered homes and cash settlements. But in 1976, the tribe rejected the offer by a vote of 61 , claiming that the tribe would be effectively disbanded by the move. In 1981, after much petitioning of the US government, and a three day march by approximately 100 Yavapai, the plan to build the dam was withdrawn. The Yavapai language is one of three dialects of the Upland Yuman language, itself a member of the Pai branch of the Yuman language family. The language includes three dialects, which have been referred to as Western, Northeastern and Southeastern, as well as Prescott, Verde Valley, and o lkabaya.

In episode 8 Derailed , Eva tells Lily the Yavapai hacked up and scalped Eva's parents, and raped her sister then bashed out her brains with rocks, but Eva had the pox and they wouldn't touch her. Instead, they traded her to some Mojave. The Yavapai tribe has also been speculated to be the inspiration for a professional wrestling strap match in which two wrestlers are bound together at the wrist by 20 feet of leather straps. In the now infamous Yapapi Indian Strap Match, Hulk Hogan and Nature Boy Ric Flair battled for World Championship Wrestling in 2000. The Yavapai feature heavily in the psychedelic western album Eyes Like the Sky by Australian band King Gizzard the Lizard Wizard. It tells of an Irish American boy in the American West during the time of the Civil War who is kidnapped by a war band of Yavapai and raised as their own.

"Yazdegerd II also spelled Yazdgerd II and Yazdgird II Middle Persian New Persian , was the sixteenth Sasanian king shah of Iran. He was the successor and son of Bahram V r. 420438 and reigned from 438 to 457. His reign was marked by wars against the Eastern Roman Empire in the west and the Hephthalites in the east, as well as by his efforts and attempts to strengthen royal centralisation in the bureaucracy by imposing Zoroastrianism on the non Zoroastrians within the country, namely the Christians. His death led to a dynastic struggle between his two sons Hormizd III and Peroz I for the throne, with the latter emerging victorious. Yazdegerd II was the first Sasanian ruler to assume the title of kay, which evidently associates him and the dynasty to the mythical Kayanian dynasty commemorated in the Avesta. The name of Yazdegerd is a combination of the Old Iranian yazad yazata divine being and karta made , and thus stands for God made , comparable to Iranian Bagkart and Greek Theoktistos. The name of Yazdegerd is known in other languages as Pahlavi Yazdekert New Persian Yazd e gerd Syriac Yazdegerd, Izdegerd, and Yazdeger Armenian Yazdkert Talmudic Izdeger and Azger Arabic Yazdeijerd Greek Isdigerdes. In 438, shah Bahram V r. 420438 died, and was succeeded by Yazdegerd II. His western neighbours, the Romans, had since their peace treaty with Iran in 387 agreed that both empires were obligated to cooperate in the defense of the Caucasus against nomadic attacks. The Romans helped in the defense of the Caucasus by paying the Iranians roughly 500 lbs 226 kg of gold at irregular intervals. While the Romans saw this payment as political subsidies, the Iranians saw it as tribute, which proved that Rome was the deputy of Iran. The Roman emperor Theodosius II's unwillingness to continue the payment made Yazdegerd II declare war against the Romans, which had ultimately little success for either side. The Romans were invaded in their southern provinces by the Vandals, causing Theodosius II to ask for peace and send his commander, Anatolius, personally to Yazdegerd II's camp. In the ensuing negotiations in 440, both empires promised not to build any new fortifications in Mesopotamia and that the Sasanian Empire would get some payment in order to protect the Caucasus from incursions. Shortly after his peace treaty with the Romans, Yazdegerd II moved towards the important Sasanian province of Armenia and defeated the Armenians, capturing nobles, priests, and troops and sending them to the eastern Sasanian provinces to protect the borders from Hephthalite attacks. In the 440s, Yazdegerd II had a mudbrick defensive system constructed at Derbent to fend off incursions from the north. In 453, Yazdegerd II moved his court to Nishapur in Khorasan to face the threat from the Hephthalites and left his minister wuzurg framadar Mihr Narseh in charge of the Sasanian Empire. He spent many years at war against the Hephthalites. According to the Sahrestaniha i Eransahr The Provincial Capitals of Iran , Yazdegerd II fortified the city of Damghan and turned it into a strong border post against the Hephthalites. It was sometime during this period that Yazdegerd II created the province of Eran Khwarrah Yazdegerd Iran, glory of Yazdegerd , which was in the northern part of the Gurgan province. After he managed to secure the eastern portion of his empire against the Hephthalite incursions, Yazdegerd II shifted his focus on Armenia and Caucasian Albania to defend the Caucasus with the Romans against the increasing Hun threat. The policies of Yazdegerd II have been the matter of discussion Arabic and Persian sources emphasize his personal piety and hostility towards the aristocracy, whilst Armenian and Syriac sources describe him as a religious fanatic. The latter aspect is often stressed in modern historiography. The unsteadiness of the empire was ever increasing under Yazdegerd II, who had an uneasy relationship with the aristocracy and was facing a great challenge by the Hephthalites in the east. At the beginning of Yazdegerd II's reign, he suffered several defeats at the hands of the Hephthalites, for which he put the blame on the Christians, due to much of his cavalry consisting of Iberians and Armenians. Persecutions of Christians first started in 446 with the Christian nobles of Karkh inn Mesopotamia. He later shifted his focus towards the Christian aristocracy of Iberia and Armenia. Yazdegerd II's persecutions of non Zoroastrians generally seem to have been limited, with the aristocracy being the primary target. Indeed, Zoroastrian aristocrats were also targeted by Yazdegerd II, who had the advantage of entry to the court dismantled and castrated men in his field armies to generate eunuchs more dutiful to him than to their own families. Yazdegerd II had originally continued his father's policies of appeasing the magnates. However, after some time, he turned away from them and started a policy of his own. When the magnates told him that his new policies had offended the people, he disagreed, saying that it is not correct for you to presume that the ways in which my father behaved towards you, maintaining you close to him, and bestowing upon you all that bounty, are incumbent upon all the kings that come after him ... each age has its own customs. Yazdegerd II, however, was still fully aware of the longstanding conflict between the crown and the nobility and priesthood, which had culminated in the murder of several Sasanian monarchs. Yazdegerd II's primary goal throughout his reign was thus to combat the internal and external issues posing a danger to country by strengthening the royal centralisation of the bureaucracy, which demanded the cooperation of the aristocracy. The justification behind this is later apparent when Yazdegerd II appointed Adhur Hormizd as the new governor marzban of Armenia in 451, putting an end to the persecution of non Zoroastrians in Armenia and allowing religious freedom in the country. This would have been an unlikely decision to have been made by a religious fanatic. Indeed, according to the modern historian Scott McDonough, the Zoroastrian faith was perhaps a test of personal loyalty for Yazdegerd II. However, Yazdegerd II's policy of integrating the Christian nobility into the bureaucracy still had problematic consequences before the appointment of Adhur Hormizd, Armenia had been plunged into a major rebellion. The cause of the rebellion was the attempt of Mihr Narseh to impose the Zurvanite variant of Zoroastrianism in Armenia. His intentions differed from those of Yazdegerd II. As a result, many of the Armenian nobles but not all rallied under Vardan Mamikonian, the supreme commander sparapet of Armenia. The Armenian rebels tried to appeal to the Romans for help, but to no avail. Meanwhile, another faction of Armenians, led by the marzban Vasak Siwni allied themselves with the Sasanians. On 2 June 451, the Sasanian and rebel forces clashed at Avarayr, with the Sasanians emerging victorious. Nine generals, including Vardan Mamikonian, were killed, with a large number of the Armenian nobles and soldiers meeting the same fate. The Sasanians, however, had also suffered heavy losses due to the resolute struggle by the Armenian rebels. Although Yazdegerd II put an end to the persecutions in the country afterwards, tensions continued until 510 when a kinsman of Vardan Mamikonian, Vard Mamikonian, was appointed marzban by Yazdegerd II's grandson, Kavad I r. 488531 . Jews were also the subject of persecution under Yazdegerd II he is said to have issued decrees prohibiting them from observing the Sabbath openly, and ordered executions of several Jewish leaders. This resulted in the Jewish community of Spahan publicly retaliating by flaying two Zoroastrian priests alive, leading in turn to more persecutions against the Jews. Yazdegerd II was an astute and well read ruler whose motto was Question, examine, see. Let us choose and hold that which is best. He is generally praised in Persian sources, and is described as a compassionate and benevolent ruler. He is commended for abandoning his father's overindulgence in hunting, feasting, and having long audience sessions. According to the medieval historians Ibn al Balkhi and Hamza al Isfahani, he was known as Yazdegerd the Gentle Yazdegerd e Narm . However, the favorable account of Yazdegerd II is due to his policy of persecuting non Zoroastrians within the empire, which appeased the Iranian aristocracy and especially the Zoroastrian priesthood, which sought to use the Sasanian Empire to impose their authority over the religious and cultural life of its people. This is the opposite of the policy of his grandfather and namesake, Yazdegerd I known as the sinner , who is the subject of hostility in Persian sources due to his tolerant policy towards his non Zoroastrian subjects, and his refusal to comply with the demands of the aristocracy and priesthood. The reign of Yazdegerd II marks the start of a new inscription on the Sasanian coins mzdysn bgy kdy The Mazda worshipping majesty, the Kayanian , which displays his fondness of the legendary Avestan dynasty, the Kayanians. This is due to a shift in the political perspective of the Sasanian Empireoriginally disposed towards the West, was now changed to the East. This shift, which had already started under Yazdegerd I and Bahram V, reached its zenith under Yazdegerd II. It may have been triggered due to the advent of hostile tribes on the eastern front of Iran. The war against the Hephthalites may have awakened the mythical rivalry existing between the Iranian Kayanian rulers and their Turanian enemies, which is demonstrated in the Younger Avesta. It may have thus been as a result of the conflict between Iran and its eastern enemies, that resulted in the adoption of the title of kay, used by the very same Iranian mythical kings in their war against the Turanians in the East. Likewise, it was most likely during this period that legendary and epic texts were collected by the Sasanians, including the legend of the Iranian hero king Fereydun Fredon in Middle Persian , who split up his kingdom among his three sons his eldest son Salm receiving the empire of the West, Rome the second eldest Tur receiving the empire of the East, Turan and the youngest Iraj receiving the heartland of the empire, Iran. Accordingly, influenced by the texts about the Kayanians, Yazdegerd II may believed to be the heir of the Fereydun and Iraj, thus possibly deeming not only Roman domains in West as belonging to Iran, but also the eastern domains of the Hephthalites. Thus the Sasanians may have sought to symbolically assert their rights over those lands by assuming the Kayanian title of kay. A new design also appeared on the reverse of the Sasanian coins, where the traditional fire altar flanked by two attendants, now imitates them in a more venerated manner. This presumably further demonstrates Yazdegerd II's fealty to Zoroastrianism. The provinces of Asoristan and Khuzestan provided the most mints for Yazdegerd II in the west, whilst the provinces of Gurgan and Marw provided the most in the east, undoubtly to support the Sasanians in their wars on the two fronts. Yazdegerd II died in 457 his eldest son Hormizd III ascended the throne at Ray. His younger son Peroz I, with the support of the powerful Mihranid magnate Raham Mihran, fled to the northeastern part of the empire and began raising an army in order to claim the throne for himself. The empire thus fell into a dynastic struggle and became divided. The mother of the two brothers, Denag, temporarily ruled as regent of the empire from its capital, Ctesiphon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd%20II
"Yazid ibn Muawiya Arabic 646 12 November 683 , commonly known as Yazid I, was the second caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. He ruled for three years from 680 until his death in 683. His appointment was the first hereditary succession in Islamic history. His caliphate was marked by the death of Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali as well as the start of the crisis known as the Second Fitna. His nomination in 676 56 AH by Muawiya was opposed by several prominent Muslims from the Hejaz. Following his accession, after Muawiya's death in 680, Husayn and Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr refused to recognize him and fled to sanctuary in Mecca. When Husayn was on his way to Kufa to lead a revolt against Yazid, he was killed with his small band of supporters by Yazid's forces in the Battle of Karbala. The killing of Husayn led to resentment in the Hejaz, where Ibn al Zubayr centered his opposition to the rule of Yazid, and was supported by many people in Mecca and Medina. After failed attempts to regain the confidence of Ibn al Zubayr and the people of the Hejaz through diplomacy, Yazid sent an army to end the rebellion. The army defeated the Medinese in the Battle of al Harrah in August 683 and the city was given over to three days of pillage. Later, siege was laid to Mecca, which lasted for several weeks. The siege ended with the death of Yazid in November 683 and the empire fell to civil war. Yazid is considered an illegitimate ruler and a tyrant by many Muslims due to his hereditary succession, the death of Husayn and the attack on the city of Medina by his forces. Modern historians present a milder view of him, and consider him a capable ruler, albeit less successful than his father. Yazid was born in Syria in 646 to Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, then governor of Syria under Caliph Uthman r. 644656 , and Maysun, the daughter of Bahdal ibn Unayf, a chieftain of the powerful Banu Kalb tribe. Yazid grew up with his maternal Kalbite tribesmen. Though during his youth he spent his springs in the desert with his Bedouin kin, for the remainder of the year he was in the company of the Greek and native Syrian courtiers of his father, who became caliph in 661. Yazid led several campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and in 670 participated in an attack on Constantinople. He also led the hajj the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca on several occasions. By the end of the first Islamic civil war August 661 , Muawiya became sole ruler of the Caliphate as a result of a peace treaty with Hasan ibn Ali, who had controlled most of the Caliphate following the murder of his father Ali a few months earlier. The terms of the treaty stipulated that Muawiya would not nominate a successor. However, in 676, Muawiya nominated Yazid as his heir. Muawiya and the shura consultation declared for Yazid in Damascus, where the former had summoned influential people from all provinces to the capital and convinced them one way or another. Muawiya ordered Marwan ibn al Hakam, then the governor of Medina, to inform the people of Medina of Muawiya's decision. Marwan faced resistance to this announcement, especially from Husayn ibn Ali, Abd Allah ibn al Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al Rahman ibn Abi Bakr. Muawiya went to Medina and pressed the four dissenters to accede, but they fled to Mecca. Muawiya followed and threatened some of them with death, but they still refused to support him. Nonetheless, he was successful in convincing the people of Mecca that the four had pledged their allegiance, and received allegiance for Yazid. On his way back to Damascus, he secured allegiance from the people of Medina as well. Yazid's opponents were silent thereafter. German orientalist Julius Wellhausen doubts the story, while Bernard Lewis writes that the homage was arranged with a mix of diplomacy and bribes and, to a lesser extent, by force. Before dying, Muawiya left Yazid a will, instructing him on matters of governing the empire. He advised him to beware of Husayn and Ibn al Zubayr, and predicted that the people of Iraq would entice Husayn into rebellion and then abandon him. Yazid was further advised to treat Husayn with caution and not to spill his blood, since he was the grandson of Muhammad. Ibn al Zubayr, on the other hand, was to be treated harshly, unless he came to terms. Muawiya also advised him to treat the people of the Hejaz well. Upon his accession, Yazid requested and received oaths of allegiance from the governors of the Caliphate's provinces. He wrote to his cousin, the governor of Medina, Walid ibn Utba ibn Abu Sufyan, informing him of the death of Muawiya and instructing him to secure allegiance from Husayn ibn Ali, Ibn al Zubayr and Ibn Umar. The instructions contained in the letter were Seize Husayn, Abdullah ibn Umar, and Abdullah ibn al Zubayr to give the oath of allegiance. Act so fiercely that they have no chance to do anything before giving the oath of allegiance. Peace be with you. Walid sought the advice of Marwan on the matter. Marwan suggested that Ibn al Zubayr and Husayn should be forced to pay allegiance as they were dangerous, while Ibn Umar should be left alone as he posed no threat. Husayn answered Walid's summon, while Ibn al Zubayr did not. When Husayn met Walid and Marwan in a semi private meeting, he was informed of Muawiya's death and Yazid's accession to the caliphate. When asked for his pledge of allegiance to Yazid, Husayn responded that giving his allegiance in private would be insufficient, such a thing should be given in public. Walid agreed, but Marwan interrupted demanding that Husayn be detained until he pledged allegiance. At this, Marwan was scolded by Husayn who then exited unharmed. Husayn had his armed retinue waiting nearby in case the authorities attempted to apprehend him. Immediately following Husayn's exit, Marwan admonished Walid, who in turn rebutted Marwan, justifying his refusal to harm Husayn by stating On the Day of Resurrection a man who is for the blood of Al Husayn little in the scale of God . Ibn al Zubayr left for Mecca that night. In the morning Walid sent eighty horsemen after him, but he escaped. Husayn too left for Mecca shortly after, without having sworn allegiance to Yazid. Dissatisfied with this failure, Yazid replaced Walid with Amr ibn Said. Unlike Husayn and Ibn al Zubayr, Ibn Umar, Abd al Rahman ibn Abi Bakr and Abd Allah ibn Abbas, who had also previously denounced Muawiya's nomination of Yazid, now paid allegiance to him. In Mecca Husayn received letters from pro Alid Kufans, inviting him to lead them in revolt against Yazid. Husayn subsequently sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the situation in the city. He also sent letters to Basra, but his messenger was handed over to the governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and killed. Ibn Aqil informed Husayn of the large scale support he found in Kufa, signaling that the latter should enter the city. Yazid ordered Ibn Ziyad to move to Kufa and execute or imprison Ibn Aqil. Ibn Ziyad brutally suppressed the rebellion and killed Ibn Aqil. Encouraged by Ibn Aqil's letter, Husayn left for Kufa, ignoring warnings from Ibn Umar, Ibn al Zubayr and Ibn Abbas that the Kufans could not be trusted. On the way to the city, he received the news of Ibn Aqil's death and that the Kufans had changed sides. Nonetheless, Husayn and his companions continued towards Kufa and Ibn Ziyad sent some 4,000 men to counter them. His troops forced them to camp in the desert of Karbala. In the ensuing hostilities on 10 October 680, Husayn and 72 of his male companions were killed, while Husayn's family were taken prisoner. This event caused widespread outcry among the Muslims and the image of Yazid suffered greatly. It also helped crystallize opposition to Yazid into an anti Umayyad movement based on Alid aspirations, and contributed to the development of Shi'ite identity. Ibn al Zubayr started secretly taking oaths of allegiance in Mecca. Upon hearing of this, Yazid sent a silver chain to Ibn al Zubayr with the intention of pacifying him, but it was refused. Yazid then sent a force led by Ibn al Zubayr's own brother Amr, who was at odds with Ibn al Zubayr, to arrest him. This force was defeated and Amr was killed. After Husayn's death at Karbala, Ibn al Zubayr's influence reached Medina and Kufa. To counter the growing influence of Ibn al Zubayr in Medina, Yazid invited notables of the city to Damascus and tried to win them over with gifts and presents. The notables were unpersuaded, and on their return to Medina narrated tales of his lavish lifestyle and practices considered by many to be impious, including drinking wine, hunting with hounds, and his love for music. The Medinese renounced their allegiance to Yazid upon hearing these details and expelled the governor and all Umayyads residing in the city. Yazid sent an army of 12,000 men under the command of Muslim ibn Uqba to reconquer Hejaz. By the end of August 683 Ibn Uqba approached Medina and gave the Medinese three days to reconsider, but was refused. When the ultimatum ended, a battle started in which the Medinese were defeated. After plundering the city for three days and forcing the rebels to renew their allegiance, the Syrian army headed for Mecca to subdue Ibn al Zubayr. According to one account, the city was not plundered, only the leaders of the rebellion were executed. Ibn Uqba died on the way to Mecca and command passed to Husayn ibn Numayr al Sakuni, who laid siege to Mecca in September 683. The siege lasted for several weeks, during which the Kaaba caught fire. Yazid's sudden death in November 683 ended the campaign and threw the caliphate into disarray and civil war. Ibn al Zubayr declared himself caliph and Iraq and Egypt came under his rule. On the foreign front, Yazid discontinued Muawiya's policy of raids against the Byzantine Empire and focused on stabilizing his borders. Islands in the Sea of Marmara were abandoned. The Syrian district of Hims was split and the new district of Qinnasrin was formed. He reappointed Uqba ibn Nafi, whom Muawiya had deposed, as governor of Ifriqiya. In 681, Uqba launched a large scale expedition into western Africa. Defeating the Berbers and the Byzantines, Uqba reached as far as the Atlantic coast and captured Tangier and Volubilis. Despite his successes, he was unable to establish a permanent hold on these territories. On his return eastward, he was ambushed and killed by a Berber Byzantine force, resulting in the loss of the conquered territories. Yazid died on 12 November 683 at Huwwarin, aged between 35 and 39. His son Muawiya II, whom he had nominated, became caliph. His control was limited to just some parts of Syria, however, and he died after a few months from an unknown illness. Some early sources state that Muawiya II abdicated before his death. In any case, Marwan ibn Hakam became caliph afterwards and the Sufyanid caliphate came to an end. According to Wellhausen, the story of abdication by Muawiya II is likely a Marwanid fabrication, since they had sidelined Sufyanids despite there being a pact that Yazid's second son Khalid will succeed Marwan. Supporters of the Sufyanids were unhappy about the development and thus arose the idea of Sufyani, a descendant of Abu Sufyan who would restore the Sufyanid power in Syria. Various Sufyani claimants arose after the fall of the Umayyads at the hand of the Abbasids. Yazid is considered an evil figure by many Muslims, especially by Shi'ites. He was the first person in the history of the caliphate to be nominated as heir based on a blood relationship, and this became a tradition afterwards. He is considered a tyrant who was responsible for three major crimes during his caliphate the death of Husayn ibn Ali and his followers at the Battle of Karbala, considered a massacre the aftermath of the Battle of al Harrah, in which the troops of Yazid's general, Muslim ibn Uqba, pillaged the town of Medina and the burning of the Kaaba during the siege of Mecca, which was blamed on Yazid's commander Husayn ibn Numayr. Moreover, because of his habits of drinking, dancing and hunting, and keeping pet animals such as dogs and monkeys, he is considered to have been impious and unworthy of leading the Muslim community. Despite his reputation in religious circles, academic historians generally portray a more favourable view of Yazid. According to Wellhausen, Yazid was a mild ruler, who resorted to violence only when necessary, and was not the tyrant that religious tradition portrays him to be. Michael Jan de Goeje describes him as a peace loving, generous prince . According to G. R. Hawting, he tried to continue the diplomatic policies of his father. However, unlike Muawiya, he was not successful in winning over the opposition with gifts and bribes. In the view of Bernard Lewis, Yazid was a capable ruler but was overly criticized by later Arab historians.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazid%20I
"YBC 7289 is a Babylonian clay tablet notable for containing an accurate sexagesimal approximation to the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal of a unit square. This number is given to the equivalent of six decimal digits, the greatest known computational accuracy ... in the ancient world . The tablet is believed to be the work of a student in southern Mesopotamia from some time in the range from 18001600 BC, and was donated to the Yale Babylonian Collection by J. P. Morgan. The tablet depicts a square with its two diagonals. One side of the square is labeled with the sexagesimal number 30. The diagonal of the square is labeled with two sexagesimal numbers. The first of these two, 1 24,51,10 represents the number 305470 216000 1.414213, an accurate numerical approximation of the square root of two. The second of the two numbers is 42 25,35 30547 720 42.426. This number is the result of multiplying 30 by the given approximation to the square root of two, and approximates the length of the diagonal of a square of side length 30. Because the Babylonian sexagesimal notation did not indicate which digit had which place value, one alternative interpretation is that the number on the side of the square is 30 60 1 2. Under this alternative interpretation, the number on the diagonal is 30547 43200 0.70711, an accurate numerical approximation of 1 2, the length of the diagonal of a square of side length 1 2. David Fowler and Eleanor Robson write, Thus we have a reciprocal pair of numbers with a geometric interpretation... . They point out that, while the importance of reciprocal pairs in Babylonian mathematics makes this interpretation attractive, there are reasons for skepticism. The reverse side is partly erased, but Robson believes it contains a similar problem concerning the diagonal of a rectangle whose two sides and diagonal are in the ratio 3 4 5. Although YBC 7289 is frequently depicted as in the photo with the square oriented diagonally, the standard Babylonian conventions for drawing squares would have made the sides of the square vertical and horizontal, with the numbered side at the top. The small round shape of the tablet, and the large writing on it, suggests that it was a hand tablet of a type typically used for rough work by a student who would hold it in the palm of his hand. The student would likely have copied the sexagesimal value of the square root of 2 from another tablet, but an iterative procedure for computing this value can be found in another Babylonian tablet, BM 96957 VAT 6598. The mathematical significance of this tablet was first recognized by Otto E. Neugebauer and Abraham Sachs in 1945. The tablet demonstrates the greatest known computational accuracy obtained anywhere in the ancient world , the equivalent of six decimal digits of accuracy. Other Babylonian tablets include the computations of areas of hexagons and heptagons, which involve the approximation of more complicated algebraic numbers such as 3. The same number 3 can also be used in the interpretation of certain ancient Egyptian calculations of the dimensions of pyramids. However, the much greater numerical precision of the numbers on YBC 7289 makes it more clear that they are the result of a general procedure for calculating them, rather than merely being an estimate. The same sexagesimal approximation to 2, 1 24,51,10, was used much later by Greek mathematician Claudius Ptolemy in his Almagest. Ptolemy did not explain where this approximation came from and it may be assumed to have been well known by his time. It is unknown where in Mesopotamia YBC 7289 comes from, but its shape and writing style make it likely that it was created in southern Mesopotamia, sometime between 1800BC and 1600BC. Yale University acquired it in 1909 as a donation from the estate of J. P. Morgan, who had collected many Babylonian tablets his bequest became the Yale Babylonian Collection. At Yale, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage has produced a digital model of the tablet, suitable for 3D printing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBC%207289
"In Norse mythology, Ydalir yew dales is a location containing a dwelling owned by the god Ullr. Ydalir is solely attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the implications of the location. Ydalir is solely attested in stanza 5 of the poem Grimnismal collected in the Poetic Edda , where Odin disguised as Grimnir tells the young Agnar that Ullr owns a dwelling in Ydalir. The stanza reads Ydalir is here translated as Ydalir Discussing Ydalir, Henry Adams Bellows comments that the wood of the yew tree was used for bows in the North just as it was long afterwards for England. Rudolf Simek says that this connexion of the god with the yew tree, of whose wood bows were made cf. ON ybogi 'yew bow' , has led to Ullr being seen as a bow god. Andy Orchard comments that Ydalir is an aptly named dwelling place archer god, Ull. According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, while Valhalla is well known because it plays so large a part in images of warfare and death, the significance of other halls in Norse mythology such as Ydalir, and the goddess Freyja's afterlife location Folkvangr has been lost. Udale, located in Cromarty, Scotland, is first recorded in 1578, and is thought to derive from Old Norse y dalr. Robert Bevan Jones proposes a connection between veneration of Ullr and Ydalir among the settling pagan Norse in Scotland and their bestowment of the name ydalr to the location.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Ddalir
"Ye Jizhuang Chinese WadeGiles Yeh Chi chuang 18931967 was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and politician nicknamed the Red Manager . He served as the logistics head of the Red Army during the Long March and of the Yan'an Communist headquarters during the Second Sino Japanese War. In 1945, he was among the first three officers awarded the rank of lieutenant general by the Communist Party of China, together with Peng Zhen and Chen Yun. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he served as the country's first Minister of Trade and then Minister of Foreign Trade until his death in 1967. Ye was born in 1893 into a poor peasant family in Xinxing County, Guangdong, Qing dynasty China. He was admitted to Guangdong Provincial Law and Politics School in 1912, and worked in the local governments of Jiangmen and Xinxing after graduating in 1914. In June 1925, he organized the Jiangmen General Union and participated in the Great CantonHong Kong strike. He joined the Communist Party of China CPC at the end of that year. After Chiang Kai shek turned against the Communists at the Shanghai massacre in 1927, Ye participated in the Guangzhou Uprising 1927 and the Baise Uprising 1929 led by Deng Xiaoping. He was a co founder of the Seventh Army of the Chinese Red Army and served as Director of its Political Department. After the Seventh Army reached the Jiangxi Soviet, the central Communist base, he was appointed Director of the Logistics Department of the Red Army. When the Long March began in October 1934, Ye was in charge of logistics for the Red Army under extremely difficult conditions, as the Communist force was under constant attacks from the Kuomintang and its allies. In his memoirs, Yang Shangkun, who later served as President of the People's Republic of China, recalls a feast Ye prepared for the officers in Hadapu, Gansu, after the army starved for days following the Battle of Lazikou. He remembered that Ye specifically asked everybody not to overeat, as it could be dangerous immediately after starvation. After the Red Army reached Yan'an a year later, Ye became the logistics head of the new Communist base there, and of the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino Japanese War. He worked on developing agriculture, manufacturing, foreign trade, and medical care for the Yan'an base, which was under economic blockade from the Kuomintang government in Chongqing. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the former Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in Northeast China became a major area of contention between the Communists and the Kuomintang. The CPC Central Committee sent a six person team to Shenyang to negotiate with the Soviet Union which had taken over the region from Japan. To facilitate their negotiation with Soviet commanders who held military ranks, the CPC awarded Peng Zhen, Chen Yun and Ye the rank of lieutenant general, Wu Xiuquan the rank of major general, and two other officers the rank of colonel. It was the first time the CPC issued military ranks. Ye served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Commerce in the Northeast People's Government , the transitional government in the Northeast in preparation for the establishment of the People's Republic of China. With the founding of the People's Republic of China PRC in October 1949, Ye was appointed the country's first Minister of Trade. In August 1952, the ministry's foreign trade division was expanded into the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Ye became its inaugural minister. It was a large ministry with many layers of organization, which served not only commercial, but also diplomatic functions. Ye served as head of the important ministry until his death in 1967. A major task of his was to circumvent the trade embargo against the PRC by the United States and its allies. Under the leadership of Zhou Enlai, he developed trade relations with Asian and African countries and signed China's first trade deal with Ceylon. After the Sino Soviet split, Ye played a key role in China's export drive in order to repay Soviet debts and finance grain purchases from abroad. Ye suffered a stroke in 1961 when he was on an official trip in Guangzhou. He became incapacitated by another stroke in 1964, and his deputy Lin Haiyun took over as acting minister in 1965. Already in very poor health, Ye came under persecution when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. He was pressured to incriminate his former superior Deng Xiaoping, but refused to do so. As he was bedridden, his doctors prevented the Red Guards from taking him to struggle sessions, and his wife Ma Luzhen was taken in his place. Ye died on 27 June 1967 at the age of 74. He was politically rehabilitated after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He is now recognized as an essential figure in the logistics of the People's Liberation Army during wartime, and the management of foreign trade of the early PRC. He is honoured as the Red Manager of the Communist Party.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye%20Jizhuang
"Ye Qianyu or Yeh Ch'ien yu 31 March 1907 5 May 1995 was a Chinese painter and pioneering manhua artist. In 1928, he cofounded Shanghai Manhua, one of the earliest and most influential manhua magazines, and created Mr. Wang, one of China's most famous comic strips. Ye was also a master of traditional Chinese painting and served as the head of the Department of Chinese Painting of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts. During the Cultural Revolution he was persecuted and imprisoned for seven years. Ye was married three times. His first two marriages, to Luo Caiyun and dancer Dai Ailian, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to movie star Wang Renmei, lasted more than 30 years until Wang's death. Ye Qianyu was born Ye Lunqi in Tonglu county, Zhejiang province in 1907. Although he loved to paint since childhood, he had neither the money nor the opportunity to seek professional training, forcing him to teach himself how to paint. At age 18 Ye moved to Shanghai, where he found work at a small, short lived journal Sanri Huabao Three Day Pictorial . The journal shut down when Chiang Kai shek's Northern Expedition army reached Shanghai in April 1927. Out of work, Ye Qianyu, then 20 years old, together with fellow cartoonists Huang Wennong and Lu Shaofei released a publication dedicated to manhua, called Shanghai Manhua or Shanghai Sketch . The first effort looked like a propaganda poster and was a failure. Undeterred, the original three, joined by eight more artists including Zhang Guangyu, Ding Song, and Wang Dunqing, formed the Shanghai Sketch Society also translated as Shanghai Cartoon Association in the autumn of 1927. It was China's first association dedicated to manhua, and its debut was a major event in the history of Chinese comics. 30 Under the leadership of Zhang Guangyu, who recruited the wealthy poet Shao Xunmei as a sponsor, the association successfully relaunched the Shanghai Manhua on 21 April 1928. Ye drew several covers for the magazine and the back page of the publication carried his comic strip, Mr. Wang. Inspired by the American strip Bringing Up Father and portraying the daily life of the middle and lower classes of Shanghai, Mr. Wang became one of China's most famous cartoons, eventually being made into 11 films in the 1930s and 40s. 86 In June 1930 Shanghai Manhua was merged into Modern Miscelleny or Modern Pictorial, , of which Ye became an editor while continuing his Mr. Wang series. In September 1936, Ye Qianyu, Lu Shaofei, and Zhang Guangyu organized the First National Cartoon Exhibition in Shanghai. It displayed over 600 cartoons from all over the country. After the overwhelming success of the exhibition, the artists formed the National Association of Chinese Cartoonists in the spring of 1937. The blossoming movement, however, was brought to a halt by the Japanese invasion a few months later. 34 When Japan invaded China and occupied Shanghai in 1937, Ye Qianyu, together with a group of fellow Shanghai cartoonists, formed the National Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps , which included well known artists Zhang Leping, Lu Zhixiang, Te Wei, and Hu Kao. Funded by the Kuomintang government, the corps left Shanghai for the interior to spread anti Japanese propaganda. 79 They first went to Wuhan, but were forced to leave when that city fell at the end of 1938. They then travelled to Changsha, Guilin, and eventually to the wartime capital Chongqing. They published 15 issues of Resistance Cartoons before the government discontinued funding. 91 Ye went to Hong Kong prior to its fall to the Japanese in December 1941, and traveled through Guizhou, Guangxi, and Vietnam. In 1943 he temporarily worked for the US General Joseph Stilwell as a war correspondent in India. Throughout his travels he drew many sketches of wartime scenes, including a series entitled Escape from Hong Kong. 92 After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Ye Qianyu went to the United States, where he held a series of exhibitions to show and sell his artworks. In 1947, Ye became a professor at the Beiping Beijing Art Academy. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he remained at the academy, which was transformed into the China Central Academy of Fine Arts. He was also elected vice chairman of the China Artists Association. In 1954, he was appointed head of the Chinese Painting Department of the academy. He painted prolifically in the 1950s, including such representative works as Indian Dancing, Autumn of the Summer River, and The Liberation of Beiping. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Ye Qianyu was accused of being a Kuomintang KMT agent for having drawn propaganda paintings and cartoons for the KMT government during the Japanese invasion. The Red Guards labeled him as a KMT Major General because he was better paid than a real general. He was imprisoned for seven years. After his release in 1975, he was allowed to return to work at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, as a janitor. He nearly died of a heart attack the following year, and underwent a major operation in 1978. His wife Wang Renmei supported the family during this period. Ye Qianyu was politically rehabilitated in 1979. In 1981 he was appointed Vice President of the Research Institute of Chinese painting, and re elected vice chairman of the China Artists Association and member of the National Committee of the CPPCC. He died in 1995 in Beijing, aged 88. Ye Qianyu was married three times. At age 23, he married Luo Caiyun , who was from a prominent family in his hometown Tonglu. It was a loveless marriage arranged by their parents. She gave birth to a son Ye Shen and a daughter Ye Mingming . In 1935, while he was an editor with the Modern Sketch magazine, Ye fell in love with Liang Baibo , one of the first female Chinese cartoonists and creator of the comic strip Miss Bee. Luo Caiyun rejected Ye's request for divorce, but they signed an agreement to officially separate. At the start of the Sino Japanese War, Liang Baibo joined Ye's Salvation Cartoon Propaganda Corps and went to Wuhan with him. However, Liang met and fell in love with an air force pilot in Wuhan, eventually following him to Taiwan. She suffered from mental illness in her later years and committed suicide in around 1970. In 1940 Ye Qianyu met the dancer Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An overseas Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai had come to Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, they fell in love and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching ling, the widow of President Sun Yat sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her as if she had been her own child. In 1950 Ye spent more than half a year in Xinjiang. When he returned to Beijing, Dai Ailian unexpectedly asked for divorce, because she had fallen in love with her dance partner. Ye was devastated the divorce was finalized in 1951. Dai Ailian lived until 2006, and is now known as the Mother of Chinese ballet . Ye's last wife was Wang Renmei, a famous actress who had been previously married to the Film Emperor Jin Yan. Introduced by mutual friends, they got married in 1955. The marriage was stormy from the beginning, but it lasted more than 30 years, through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, until Wang's death in 1987. Luo Caiyun, Ye Qianyu's first wife, lived with their son Ye Shen in Wuxi, Jiangsu. When Ye Qianyu was accused of being a KMT agent and thrown into prison during the Cultural Revolution, Luo was persecuted for being his ex wife. She committed suicide in 1970.

"Yeah 3x pronounced Yeah three times or Yeah Yeah Yeah sometimes stylized as Yeah 3X is a song by American singer Chris Brown, released as the lead single from his fourth studio album F.A.M.E. on October 25, 2010. It was written by Brown, DJ Frank E, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter, with Adam Richard Wiles receiving an additional writing credit following his accusation of plagiarism. The song was produced by DJ Frank E. Brown recorded the song for his pop audience as he had been doing a lot of mixtapes and urban records. Yeah 3x is an uptempo dance pop, Europop, and electro house song it uses a video game type beat and features a thick bassline and big synth chords. Yeah 3x attained top ten positions in Australia, Austria, Belgium Flanders , Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also reached the top twenty in Canada, Norway, Slovakia and Sweden. In the United States, the song peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at number seven on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed at Universal Studios. The video features Brown in various dance sequences in a neighborhood of old time storefronts and brownstones. It also features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. It was also included on the set list of his 2011 F.A.M.E. Tour. Yeah 3x was written by Brown, DJ Frank E, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter and Calvin Harris, and was produced by DJ Frank E. It was recorded at The Record Planta studio in Los Angeles, Californiaand Serban Ghenea mixed the track at Mixstar Studiosa studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia. On September 2, 2010, Brown tweeted that the Polow da Don produced song titled Calypso would be released soon as the follow up single to Deuces 2010 . However, those plans were changed when Yeah 3x was released instead. While filming the music video for the song, Brown elaborated on the song's inspiration in an interview with Access Hollywood. He stated that he wanted to record the song for his pop audience since he had been doing so much urban material. Brown said the song was given to him by DJ Frank E while he was in the studio writing songs for other artists and himself. I heard the track and I was like man this is incredible. It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling so I wanted to do more of a song for my pop audience. Ive been doing a lot of mix tape stuff, a lot of urban records ... the pop audience didnt really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and its just positive record. Its not anything too over the top its just right where it needs to be. During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that the song was written in 15 minutes We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record. Yeah 3x is an uptempo dance pop, Europop, and electro house song. Over a video game type beat, Brown opens the song by proclaiming, In the moment, can't believe You're so beautiful Feels like I'm in a dream. Throughout the song, it features a thick bassline. Yeah 3x is set in common time with a moderate dance tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of A4 to the note of B5. The song uses a portion of the melody from I'm Not Alone by Calvin Harris. According to Robbie Daw of Idolator, Yeah 3x is a mixture of Forever 2008 and La Roux's Bulletproof 2009 , while Sean Michaels of The Guardian commented that the song seems to be inspired by David Guetta's Eurodance sound. Nick Levine of Digital Spy musically compared the song's production to the sounds of Usher, Taio Cruz, Jay Sean, The Black Eyed Peas and Calvin Harris. The accompanying music video for Yeah 3x was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios. It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto the top of a truck in a neighborhood of old timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled Popin Pete's and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink salmon colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers. The video ends as Brown spins, stops and looks off into the distance. Ed Easton Jr. of WNOW FM gave the video a rating of seven out of ten, writing that, there is plenty of choreographed dancing as Breezy shows us he still got it, getting everyone in the neighborhood to dance with him. The video is good for the most part, especially if you are a fan of dancing. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, it's genuinely a fun clip, absent of any overdone, sexed up R B corniness. Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the video to Michael Jackson's The Way You Make Me Feel 1987 , and Janet Jackson's Alright 1990 , concluding that sure, the 'Yeah 3x' clip is derivative. But at least Brown is making a serious effort to polish up his commercial appeal once again with both a feel good, sing along song and an equally sunny video. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine simply called it a kid friendly clip . The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. A pre taped performance of Brown performing Yeah 3x and a medley of Beautiful People and Forever was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges and members of the crowd. Prior to the performance, some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control , while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something. So don't put me in a position where you are asking me to not say something, because I really won't do that. On July 15, 2011 Brown performed the song in front of an audience of 18,000 at the Rockefeller Plaza in New York City for the Today concert series. For the performance, Brown wore a white shirt and black pants, and was accompanied by male dancers wearing black jumpsuits and red sneakers. On August 28, 2011, Brown performed a medley of Beautiful People and Yeah 3x at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. He opened his performance with Yeah 3x and was dressed in a white formal suit, accompanied by full skirted dancers . Brown was eventually joined onstage by tuxedo clad dancers and began dancing to the 1993 Wu Tang Clan single Protect Ya Neck . His dance routine then moved into 1991, where he danced to Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit . Brown's performance then came back to the future, where he began to sing Beautiful People . While performing the song, he was suspended in the air, and then lowered to another stage where he continued to perform the song. Brown then went back in the air, where he did splits and back flips. Yeah 3x was added to the set list of Brown's 2011 F.A.M.E. Tour in Australia and North America, and at the Supafest tour in April 2012. Amar Toor of AOL Radio called the song dance friendly , and wrote with its electro vibe and frenetic pulse, 'Yeah 3x' sounds like the perfect club banging anthem to get any night off to a raucous start. Ed Easton Jr. of radio station WNOW FM noted the song's similarities to Brown's 2008 single Forever 2008 , writing that it has that fun and simple lyrical flow and puts more emphasis on the intoxicating beat. He also called the song a beat banging dance track that would keep Brown rising back to the top. Megan Vick of Billboard magazine added that Brown's career has had its share of twists and turns, but 'Yeah 3x' proves he can still turn out a speaker bumping track. Bri LaPelusa of UR Chicago called it a true party anthem due to the chorus You love to drink So do we Get my bottles Bring 'em to me Hold your glasses up People everywhere. Tom Howard of Yahoo Music called it a clubby summer tune. Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that it's a great song, full of party riffic electronic beats made for dancing. Scottish producer and DJ Calvin Harris claimed that Yeah 3x plagiarised his 2009 single I'm Not Alone . He tweeted, Choked on my cornflakes when I heard new Chris Brown single this morning. Do you know what I mean After receiving many abusive messages from Brown's fans after posting the comment, he later tweeted, I don't care that you call me a nobody. Stealing is still stealing, doesn't matter who you are ... Because Chris Brown is an international celebrity doesn't make it OK to rip off a guy from UK not many people have heard of. When asked in an interview with Australia's Herald Sun if Brown knew him, Harris replied, Well, he's never heard of me, that's the funniest thing. But the producer he's worked with, DJ Frank E, has definitely heard of me. He's a respected producer, he's worked with Tiesto on a few tracks, perhaps that's where the link is. It's all a bit of fun. Brown later spoke with Harris and upon hearing the similarities between the two songs, had Harris' name added to the songwriting credits. In the United States, Yeah 3x debuted at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated November 13, 2010. After weeks of ascending and descending the Hot 100, Yeah 3x peaked at number 15 in the issue dated January 29, 2011, and spent 20 weeks on the chart. The song charted successfully on the US Pop Songs chart at number seven. Yeah 3x failed to chart on the US Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart, instead reaching number 22 on the Bubbling Under R B Hip Hop Singles chart, which lists the 25 songs below the Hot R B Hip Hop Songs' number 100 position. On October 3, 2017, the single was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA for combined sales and streaming equivalent units of over two million units in the United States.

"Yeah is a song by American singer Usher. The song is co written by Sean Garrett, Patrick J. Que Smith, Robert McDowell, LRoc, Ludacris, and Lil Jon, who also produced the song. It also features guest vocals from Lil Jon and Ludacris, with the former also producing the song as well as incorporating crunk and R Bwhich he coined as crunk Bin the song's production. The song was released as the lead single from Usher's fourth studio album Confessions 2004 on January 27, 2004, after Usher was told by Arista Records, his label at the time, to record more tracks for the album. Yeah topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for 12 consecutive weeks, before being dethroned by Usher's follow up single Burn . Yeah was the longest running number one single in 2004, subsequently topping the year end chart on the Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA . The song received a similar response in other countries, topping in other twelve charts worldwide. It was certified platinum in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany and Norway, and received a two times platinum certification in New Zealand. The song peaked in the top ten in several Year end charts. An accompanying music video, directed by Mr. X, shows Usher, Ludacris and Lil Jon performing choreography in a club in front of blue laser beams. Yeah won a Best Rap Sung Collaboration at the 47th Grammy Awards, while being nominated for Record of the Year. The song ranked second on the Billboard Hot 100 20002009 Decade end chart. As of September 2013, the song has sold over 4 million copies in the US. In the fall of 2003, Usher submitted his fourth studio album, Confessions 2004 , to his record label Arista Records. However, when the singer and the company's then president L.A. Reid listened to the songs, Reid felt the album lacked a song that had the potential to be released as the album's lead single. In light of this, Usher was told to record a few more tracks, and so he enlisted American rapper producer Lil Jon to aid in musical production. Lil Jon recalled, He needed a single. They had 'Burn', 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's when I came in. Several months prior to Lil Jon's involvement in the production of Confessions, he was commissioned by Jive Records to produce fifteen tracks for rapper Mystikal. The rapper would only select two tracks, which provided Lil Jon the opportunity to give leftover songs to other record labels. Without Lil Jon's knowledge, Jive Records gave one of the leftover tracks to hip hop artist Petey Pablo which would eventually become Freak a Leek . However, Lil Jon, assuming that the song had not been used, gave the production to Usher, resulting in a rough version of Yeah . Eventually realizing the mistake after Pablo played Freek a leek to Lil Jon, the latter insisted on producing more tracks for Pablo however, Pablo did not give up the song, due to the fact that it was already recorded and had been getting responses from Southern radio. Lil Jon commented, With so much invested, Jive wouldn't give up the cut. Lil Jon jumped back in the studio and created an equally catchy replacement track. Though Yeah was now completed, the label still had Burn on queue for the lead single. Usher's friend and former A R rep Kawan KP Prather commented 'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that ' At the end of the day, you want an event. Usher was still unsure if Yeah was the right choice. Lil Jon, who is also a DJ, then decided to leak the record to DJs across the country after the record companies shut down for Christmas break. By the time they got back to business in January, the record already had thousands of radio plays with no label involvement. Usher still opted to go with Burn as the lead single as a music video was already planned, however, the responses to Yeah were overwhelmingly favorable, and Yeah was released as the first single with Burn becoming the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12 single. LaFace Records sent Yeah to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two additional tracks from the album, Red Light also produced by Lil Jon and Sweet Lies . Yeah combines the genres of crunk and R B genres, to form Crunk B, which Lil Jon described as R B songs that get you crunk, make you wanna wild out . Entertainment Weekly's Jem Aswad found the song to contain crunk and transition between hip hop, soul and ballad genres. The song was co written by Sean Garrett, Patrick J. Que Smith, Ludacris, Robert McDowell, and James Elbert LRoc Phillips. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony ATV Music Publishing, Yeah is written in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 105 beats per minute, It is written in the key of G minor. Usher's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of B4. Sasha Frere Jones of The New Yorker on its success. Yeah was lauded by contemporary critics for its production. Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly called it irresistibly crunked out , adding, the ensuing track glides smoothly between club friendly hip hop soul and ballads. Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone commented that the song creates sensual panic by combining Usher's jumpy attacks with Jon's sublime, frayed beats. Jon Caramanica of Blender noted that Yeah is the first song to mix mainstream R B and menacing Southern crunk. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that the song has brought Usher to a whole new level of crunk. Andy Kellman of Allmusic described the song as a crunk meets R B foundation which features an instantly addictive eight note keyboard vamp . He added that the song is so absorbing that Ludacris' 1500th guest verse floats by with little notice. Matt Cibula of PopMatters characterized the song as a full fledged club uber crunk salacious but he added that it fails to be a club banger . Steve Jones of USA Today referred to Yeah as a club rattling song from a combination of Atlanta's vibrant music scene , Lil Jon's insistent beats and Ludacris' racy rhymes . Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times described Yeah as a raucous tale of dance floor seduction which pop musician Michael Jackson would have produced in 2004, if he still had the old Thriller magic . Usher himself also garnered praise for the song Aswad called it the grittiest song Usher had sung and one that reveals his newfound maturity . Caramanica said that it is probably the scariest record in a good way he's ever made and Usher smartly shares the spotlight. Cibula stated that Usher's smoove ass singing and Ludacris' presence contributes to the success of the single. Yeah was nominated at the 2005 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, and won the Best Rap Sung Collaboration award. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards, Yeah was nominated for best R B Soul or Rap Dance Cut.

Mr. X, formerly Little X, had previously directed videos for Usher's singles U Don't Have to Call and U Got It Bad . Mr. X said that the song reminded him of laser beams. Usher and Mr. X combined ideas to create a dance video for Yeah . The development was handled by how Usher wanted to be portrayed in the video, particularly showcasing his dance moves. The music video was filmed in a vacant art gallery in Los Angeles over two days. When the shooting started, Mr. X recalled Michael Jackson's low tech and laser flashing 1979 Rock with You video, and used it as a reference. Forty extra people were commissioned to dance with Usher, and two ladies to tempt him in different scenes. They went through photo browsing and phone calling, opting for Destiny Lightsy, a friend of Mr. X, who seduces Usher in the club in a Marilyn Monroe wardrobe to complement the lyrics. Canadian model Melyssa Ford, who was discovered by Mr. X, is portrayed as Usher's second seductress. Lil Jon acted as an assistant director during the sessions. Usher took charge of his ideas on his wardrobe and choreography, with additional routines, specifically the Rockaway and the Thunderclap, which Mr. X learned from Jamaica. The Rockaway influenced Fat Joe and Terror Squad's Lean Back video. The video begins with Usher entering a club, and in another scene dancing in front of blue lasers the video alternates between both the club and laser scenes throughout. In the former setting, Usher is sat down when a womanportrayed by Destiny, video producer Mr. X's friendapproaches him and attempts to seduce him. The woman stands up and walks to the dance floor, telling Usher to come get me and baby let's go , in sync with the song. Usher goes and dances with her during the chorus. In the beginning of the second verse, the laser scene with Usher dancing now shows both blue and green lasers. Usher and the woman are still dancing, with the woman further attempting to seduce him. In the second chorus, Usher performs choreography in the club, backed up by several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards the camera in the laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is dancing in both the club and laser scene, with the camera also alternating to female's dancing in sync in the club. In the final chorus, Usher again performs choreography in the club, with another scene in the latter setting this time showing a different seductress, portrayed by model Melyssa Ford, walking away telling him to follow her. While following her, he is in a hallway, with the women then pulling Usher in a room, where they begin to romance. While Ludacris says his final verse, rapper Chingy and P. Diddy's former assistant, Fonzworth Bentley, both make appearances with Bentley holding a violin. Lil Jon says his final verse, not present in the track version of Yeah , where he repeats numerous dance moves including the Rockaway and Thunderclap, with Usher performing them. The video ends with Lil Jon repeating rock away and then cut . At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, Usher won his first 2 awards with Best Dance Video and Best Male Video. At the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for the Michael Jackson Award for Best R B Soul or Rap Music Video. The song has been featured in the films Hitch, The Hangover, and The Interview as well as the television shows House and Getaway. It has also been in ads for Metro by T Mobile. When the Washington Nationals played in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and were known as the Montreal Expos, the song would play over the Olympic Stadium public address system whenever the opposing teams at bat list for the next inning would be announced. sales figures based on certification alone shipments figures based on certification alonesales streaming figures based on certification alone",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah%21%20%28Usher%20song%29
"The Year of the Sex Olympics is a 1968 television play made by the BBC and first broadcast on BBC2 as part of Theatre 625. It stars Leonard Rossiter, Tony Vogel, Suzanne Neve and Brian Cox. It was directed by Michael Elliott. The writer was Nigel Kneale, best known as the creator of Quatermass. Influenced by concerns about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts a world of the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations of a group of people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television. Kneale had fourteen years earlier adapted George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four as a classic and controversial BBC broadcast and the play reflects much of Kneale's assimilation of Orwell's concern about the power of the media and Kneale's experience of the evolving media industry. In the future, society is divided between 'low drives' that equate with the labouring classes and 'hi drives' who control the government and media. The low drives are controlled by a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi drives are convinced will pacify them, though one hi drive, Nat Mender Tony Vogel , believes that the media should be used to educate the low drives. After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response, the co ordinator Ugo Priest Leonard Rossiter decides to commission a new programme. In The Live Life Show, Nat Mender, his partner Deanie Suzanne Neve and their daughter Keten Lesley Roach are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low drive audience watches. Mender's former colleague, Lasar Opie Brian Cox , feeling that something's got to happen , decides to spice up the show by introducing a dangerous element to the island, and The Live Life Show is deemed a triumph. Nigel Kneale was a Manx television playwright who had come to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his adaptation of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four and his three Quatermass serials, all of which had been made by the BBC. Kneale had since become disenchanted with the BBC, mainly because he had received no extra money when the BBC sold the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment, and had turned to freelance writing, producing scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. When approached by the BBC for a script for the BBC2 anthology series Theatre 625, Kneale, still upset over the sale of the film rights to The Quatermass Experiment, turned them down. The Director General of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene intervened and arranged a 3,000 ex gratia payment to Kneale in recognition of Quatermass' success. Kneale accepted a commission from Theatre 625 producer Michael Bakewell on Friday, 7 April 1967 for what would become The Year of the Sex Olympics. Kneale's concept concerned the world of the future, and a way of keeping the population happy without being active . According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down . Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking ... which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated . Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale'sin the mid sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam Pow Zapp , and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from traditional cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor . Kneale also sought to make a comment on television and the idea of the passive audience , depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced languagethey wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do a lot of thinking, and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of languagepossiblythat you did get in the play . Kneale's script was accepted on 25 October 1967 by Ronald Travers, who had taken over as producer from Michael Bakewell on Theatre 625. Production began in early 1968 with Michael Elliot as director. Elliot initially asked Leo McKern to take on the key role of Co ordinator Ugo Priest, but with McKern unavailable, he turned to Leonard Rossiter. Writing to Rossiter, offering him the part, Elliot described The Year of the Sex Olympics as the most important play Nigel Kneale has written since Quatermass . Cast as Lasar Opie was Brian Cox, who would go on to have a distinguished career in film and television. The Year of the Sex Olympics proved to be a difficult production when the 'Clean Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, and by the end of the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes. BBC2 was the only UK television station broadcasting in colour at the time. The Year of the Sex Olympics presented a production with gaudy sets, costumes and makeup. In a contemporary review of the play for The Sun newspaper, Nancy Banks Smith commented that If you didn't see it in colour, you didn't really see it . The Year of the Sex Olympics was broadcast at 9 08pm on BBC2 on Monday 29 July 1968. Appearing on arts programme Late Night Line Up later that night to discuss the play, Kneale said You can't write about the future. One can play with the processes that might occur in the future, but one is really always writing about the present because that is what we know. It's largely an image of television as I know it . Sean Day Lewis, writing in The Daily Telegraph, hailed the programme as a highly original play written with great force and making as many valid points about the dangers of the future as any science fiction I can rememberincluding 1984 . The Year of the Sex Olympics was watched by 1.5 million viewers. Audience Research Report indicated that many viewers found the play impenetrable. It was repeated on BBC1 in 1970 with 15 minutes cut from the running time, as part of The Wednesday Play strand. As often happened in this era, the colour master tapes of The Year of the Sex Olympics were wiped some time after broadcast and the play was believed lost until the 1980s when a black and white telerecording was discovered. This copy was released on DVD, with an introduction by film and television historian Kim Newman, a commentary by actor Brian Cox and a copy of the original script, by the British Film Institute in 2003. One of the first to draw comparisons with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes soap operas without professional actors , such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks Smith in a review of the first series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome . Banks Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968 Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask . Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, Don't they know what they're doing ... It's The Year of the Sex Olympics Nigel Kneale was right . When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that in many respects Kneale was right on the money ... when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train wreck on live TV . Although the reality television of The Live Life Show is the aspect most commentators pick up on, The Year of the Sex Olympics is also a wider satire on sensationalist television and the media in general. Mark Gatiss has noted that the Artsex and Foodshow programmes that also appear in the play ingeniously depicted the future of lowest common denominator TV . This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman, who has said that as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self criticism on the part of television professionals, who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings chasing sensationalism, the play ... is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging and has concluded that Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting, 'I was right I was right '",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Year%20of%20the%20Sex%20Olympics
"A Year Without Rain is a song by American band Selena Gomez the Scene. It was written by Lindy Robbins and Toby Gad, with the latter also producing the song. The song was released on September 7, 2010 as the second and final single from the band's second album of the same name. A Spanish language version of the song was also recorded, entitled Un Ano Sin Lluvia . Gomez titled the album for the song because she wanted to base all the other songs around it. Musically, the song is a Eurodance track backed with a disco beat. In its lyrics, the song's protagonist compares yearning for her love to a year without rain. Music critics gave the song positive reviews, complimenting it as a dance ballad and noting Gomez's vocal maturity. A Year Without Rain became the band's third consecutive top forty single in the United States and Canada. It also charted in the lower regions of numerous European charts. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Chris Dooley and shot on site in Lucerne Valley, California features Gomez frolicking in the desert surrounded by a swarm of photographs of her and her love interest, before they meet during a rainstorm. The band performed the song a number of times via live performances, including on televised programs such as Good Morning America, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and the 2011 People's Choice Awards. In early 2010, a demo of the song, performed by singer RaVaughn leaked online. Becky Bain of Idolator called the song a mature dance track and said that it wouldnt entirely be out of place on a Sophie Ellis Bextor album. It seems that it was first made for Leona Lewis. In an interview with MTV News, Gomez said that A Year Without Rain was the first song she recorded for the album. She also explained why she named the album for the song, commenting, I feel like that song has a lot of meaning, and it also kind of was the start of what I wanted to base all the other songs around. A Spanish language version of the song titled Un Ano Sin Lluvia was released through the iTunes Store on October 26, 2010. A Year Without Rain was written by Lindy Robbins and Toby Gad, the later also producing it, with a length of three minutes and twenty nine seconds. Musically, it has been described as a dance track, more especifically as Eurodance. It has also been called a synth pop and electro track which uses a standard pop structure and is backed with a disco beat. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, A Year Without Rain is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C Mixolydian and follows the chord progression of CGmDmF throughout most of the song, but the Bridge is written in D Minor, following a chord progression of Bb C Am Dm. It's important to mention that C Mixolydian and D Minor share the same key signature, so the musical notes of both modes are the same, but the tonic note is different. Gomez's vocals in the song span from F3 to E5. Lyrically, the song sees Gomez longing for the object of her affection and compares it to a year without rain I need you by my side Don't know how I'll survive A day without you is like a year without rain. According to Megan Vick of Billboard, the sound of the song contrasts with its tender lyrics. Although he called it one of the album's pensive moments , Bill Lamb of About.com noted the track as one of the top songs on the album, calling it a beautiful dance ballad. Lamb also said the song shows Selena Gomez is clearly growing up as an artist. Stating that it showed her maturation as an artist , Lamb later ranked the song number thirty nine on the site's list of Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010 . Allmusic's Tim Sendra also named the song a standout on the album, calling it catchy and well sung . Megan Vick of Billboard said that while Gomez did not have the vocal power of Demi Lovato, she makes a strong effort to attack the high notes as she croons the chorus . Vick stated that the song is compelling enough to separate the singer from other Disney groomed pop stars. Wairarapa Times Age writer Kim Gillespie named A Year Without Rain one of the album's highlights. David Welsh of musicOMH noted Gomez' mature performance and wrote that the song reaps rewards with an impressively heartbroken stab at euro dance . In contrast, The Washington Post critic Allison Stewart was unfavorable of the lyrical content of the song, commenting that it was the sort of exercise in teenage co dependence...that should be long extinct. Propelled by its debut at number fourteen on the Hot Digital Songs chart, A Year Without Rain debuted at number thirty five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's third consecutive top forty single. It remained on the chart for four weeks. On the week dated January 1, 2011, the song debuted at number thirty six on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. As of August 2014, the song has sold 1,002,000 downloads in the US. The song achieved greater success in Canada, peaking at thirty on the Canadian Hot 100. The song also appeared on numerous European charts, peaking at seventy eight in the United Kingdom, fifty six in Germany, and forty one in Slovakia. It also reached number three on the Belgian Flanders Tip chart. The music video, directed by Chris Dooley, was shot on location in Lucerne Valley, California. It premiered on September 3, 2010 on Disney Channel, following the premiere of Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam and a sneak peek of Fish Hooks. The video starts off with the band driving through the desert in a red convertible. Gomez removes a photograph from the sun visor, which is subsequently blown away by the wind. The chorus commences as the band disappears and Gomez steps out of the vehicle, wearing a dress and begins to sing. As the video progresses, a multitude of photographs of her relationship fall from the sky, as Gomez travels elegantly through the desert. During the bridge, it starts to rain as Gomez spots her love interest Niko Pepaj in the distance. The two begin to walk towards each other, and the video ends as they meet and hold hands. Nadine Cheung of AOL JSYK said She sings 'I'm missing you so much Can't help it, I'm in love A day without you is like a year without rain' and that's really what's depicted in a simple and sweet way. A Spanish version Un Ano Sin Lluvia of the video was released on November 19 on Vevo. The band first performed the song on September 22, 2010 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The band performed the song on Good Morning America on September 23, 2010. On November 16, 2010, the band performed the song on Lopez Tonight, and they performed it on Live with Regis and Kelly on December 1, 2010. They performed the song at the 2011 People's Choice Awards on January 5, 2011, and afterwards were awarded the Choice award for Favorite Breakout Artist. Gomez appeared on stage accompanied by low lights and fog. Kara Warner of MTV News commented, Although it wasn't a stadium rocking performance a la Lady Gaga or Katy Perry, Gomez powered through her pop song with a sense of earnestness and commitment. She didn't even miss a beat when her earpiece appeared to fall out mid song. The song was also performed during the We Own the Night Tour . sales figures based on certification alone shipments figures based on certification alone Since May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for digital singles include on demand audio and or video song streams in addition to downloads.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20Year%20Without%20Rain%20%28song%29
"The Years of Rice and Salt is an alternate history novel by American science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson, published in 2002. The novel explores how world history might have been different if the Black Death plague had killed 99 of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67 year long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life. The novel explores themes of history, religion, and social movements. The historical narrative is guided more by social history than political or military history. Critics found the book to be rich in detail, realistic, and thoughtful. The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award. At the time of publication in 2002, science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson was 49 years old and living in Davis, California. He had conceived of the premise for The Years of Rice and Salt in the 1970s while thinking about what alternate history scenario would result in the biggest change that would still work in terms of comparison to our history . He subsequently developed an interest in China and in Buddhism which he would study for this project. Robinson's only other alternate history story prior to this project was the short story The Lucky Strike 1984 , where the Enola Gay crashes in a training exercise and the secondary crew must complete the Hiroshima bombing. Robinson also wrote an essay titled A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions 1991 , comparing different theories of history and laws of science, such as the covering law model, to explain how alternate histories can be arrived at, using The Lucky Strike as an example. He explored the idea of non Western influences creating a new culture while working on his Mars trilogy, which involved a heavy Muslim influence in a Martian colony. The Mars trilogy gave Robinson a reputation for quality of writing and a richness of detail comparable to James Michener, as well as winning him a Nebula Award for Red Mars 1993 and two Hugo and Locus Awards for Green Mars 1994 and Blue Mars 1996 . Robinson followed the Mars trilogy with the novel Antarctica 1997 , which won an Alex Award, and two short story collections, The Martians 1999 and Vinland the Dream 2001 , before publishing The Years of Rice and Salt. The story is divided into ten parts. Book One, Awake to Emptiness, begins with Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, discovering a Magyar village where all the inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe, encountering only one lone native. Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for what they have done to him and he incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials. Book Two, The Haj in the Heart, begins in Mughal India where a Hindu girl named Kokila poisons her husband's father and brother after discovering their plot to defraud the village. She is executed for her crime, but is reborn as a tiger that befriends a man named Bistami, a Sufi mystic of Persian origin. Bistami goes on to become a judge for Mughal Emperor Akbar, but later falls into his disfavour, being exiled to Mecca. Bistami spends one year in Mecca before travelling overland to the Maghreb and Iberia Al Andalus . Bistami then joins a caravan led by Sultan Mawji and his wife, Katima, who seek to leave Al Andalus and found a new city on the other side of the Pyrenees, beyond the control of the Caliph of Al Andalus. They build the city of Baraka on the abandoned former site of Bayonne, France, and create a model society in which Sultana Katima is highly influential. Katima seeks to change the Islamic religion to create equality between men and women, by rejecting the Hadiths and relying only on her interpretation of the Quran. She rules the community after her husband dies something not allowed in normal Islamic practice , but the Caliph of Al Andalus eventually hears of their heresy and sends an army against them. The community flees further to the north, where they build a new city named Nsara near Nantes, France and are able to defend it from further aggression in later years. In Book Three, Ocean Continents, the Wanli Emperor launches an invasion against Nippon Japan but the huge fleet is swept out to sea by the Kuroshio Current and they are set adrift on the unexplored Pacific Ocean. The fleet hopes to be brought back to China eventually by the great circular currents of the Pacific, but they accidentally discover the New World. The sailors make landfall on the West coast of North America and make contact with the indigenous population the peaceful Miwok people , but quickly leave once Admiral Kheim discovers they have inadvertently infected the indigenous people with devastating diseases. They take a small girl with them whom they have taught Chinese and named Butterfly and sail south where they meet another civilization rich in gold. There they narrowly escape being ritually sacrificed by using their flintlock firearms, something the natives have never seen before. They eventually return to China and tell the Emperor that he could easily conquer this new land and gain its great wealth. Book Four, The Alchemist, takes place in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, attempts to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone, but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with alchemy and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books. His friends Iwang a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician and Bahram a Sufi blacksmith instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest and alarm amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East. Book Five, Warp and Weft, describes how a former Samurai, fleeing from Japan which was conquered by China along with most of the rest of East Asia to the New World, travels all the way across the continent to meet the Iroquois people. They name him From West and make him a chief of their confederacy. He helps organize their society into a larger defensive alliance of all the North American tribes the Hodenosaunee League and shows them how to make their own guns with which to resist the Chinese coming from the West and the Muslims coming from the East. Book Six, Widow Kang, follows the life of Chinese widow Kang Tongbi during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. She takes in a poor Buddhist monk, Bao Ssu, and his son whom she finds scavenging, but the monk is wrongly implicated in a series of queue cuttings and is killed by Qing magistrates. Later, Kang meets a Hui Muslim scholar named Ibrahim ibn Hasam and together they discover it is possible to remember their past lives. They marry and move to Lanzhou in western China, where they undertake work to try to reconcile Islamic and Confucian beliefs. Kang creates and collects works of proto feminist poetry and becomes a known writer. There is a Muslim rebellion in the region due to the Qing intolerance of new Islamic sects coming from the west, but the revolt is crushed with massive force. Book Seven, The Age of Great Progress, is set during the 19th century and begins during a war between the Ottoman Empire and the Indian state of Travancore. The Indians have previously defeated the Mughals and the Safavids and have developed more modern forms of warfare, emphasising surprise and mobility, they have also invented steam engines and ironclad warships which they sail straight to the city of Konstantiniyye and capture it with the aid of military balloons. The Ottomans are defeated easily. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore where he learns of the amazing advancements that have been made on the sub continent such as railways and factories. He happily joins the hospital of Travancore and begins work in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who pursues scientific and philosophical advancement a kind of Enlightened Despot . The Kerala's aim is to drive the Muslim invaders away and peacefully unify India into a kind of democratic confederation. Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, in the Chinese colony known as Gold Mountain, major flooding in the Central Valley of California forces the evacuation of Chinese colonial towns and Japanese settlers alike. The Japanese had originally fled to the new world to escape Chinese oppression in their homeland, but find themselves once again under the Chinese yoke. A displaced Japanese slave, Kiyoaki, and a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng ti, manage to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang. There Kiyoaki joins a secret Japanese freedom movement which is being aided by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a go between agent. Book Eight, War of the Asuras, is set in the 20th century, during the Long War . The world has become divided into three large alliances, the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the fractured Muslim world Dar al Islam , and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war the Muslim states put aside their differences and unite to fight the larger threat of China whom they fear will soon achieve global hegemony . The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, as they see the Muslims as their greater enemy, however the Muslims invade northern India all the way down to Burma to stop the Indians and Chinese from linking up. The war drags on for decades causing major changes in the societies involved, with rapid industrialisation, mass conscription and mass casualties both sides are forced to use women in the fighting to make up for manpower losses . Being the first industrial war, new devastating weapons and methods are employed, such as trench warfare, poison gas and aerial bombing. The story follows Chinese officers, Kuo, Bai and Iwa as they desperately fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments. The new Chinese government, the Fourth Assemblage of Military Talent , orders a new offensive against the Muslim lines in Gansu. Kuo, Bai and Iwa are told to use poison gas and then frontally assault the enemy trenches. They do this successfully, but are beaten back by the second line of Muslim defences, losing tens of thousands of soldiers and gaining nothing. They are then told that their attack was merely a diversion for the real offensive which is being conducted by the Japanese who have recently been freed by China in exchange for alliance in the war through Siberia. The Muslims are in retreat but the Japanese get bogged down at the Ural Mountains. In the meantime, Kuo is killed by a shell which penetrates their bunker. Bai and Iwa are ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas they witness the Muslim artillery blasting the top of Mount Everest down so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. After extreme difficulties they manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass and the Chinese army pours through to meet up with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favour. Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him that none of this is happening and that he is already dead, killed by the shell earlier. Bai does not know whether he is indeed living real life or is already in the afterlife. Book Nine, Nsara, follows the life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the aftermath of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave the life of captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara Saint Nazaire in France . There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrolls in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation the two have a brief affair . Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort something which the Chinese did almost totally . There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic . Life in Nsara and all the Muslim nations becomes increasingly difficult as they face the effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, there is a great shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them . The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League who have become very powerful after their victory in the war intervene by sending a fleet from their naval base at Orkney to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war. Throughout this, Idelba has been secretly working on atomic physics and she and her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that it would be possible to make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference . Book Ten, The First Years, follows Bao Xinhua. Bao is a revolutionary in China, who works under the leadership of his friend, Kung Jianguo. Bao and Kung successfully overthrow the oppressive Chinese government, but Kung is killed on the cusp of their victory. Deeply depressed and disillusioned, Bao leaves China and begins a voyage around the world. Bao marries and raises two children before accepting a diplomatic post in Myanmar. Eventually, Bao's wife dies, and he begins to wander once again. Bao spends time studying with a comrade from his revolutionary years named Isao Zhu, who poses many macrohistorical questions about the world in which they live. In his later years, Bao moves to Fangzhang to teach history and the philosophy of history, and at the end of the novel, he meets a new student named Kali. The novel is divided into ten chapters which each act as a short story, linked by the use of a group of people who appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group or jati are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself or herself killed and striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering . The B characters are more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic and survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better . The I characters are the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving. The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked. Robinson incorporated utopian themes in his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a utopian novelist in that he claims all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences . Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory or identity and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and struggles over the nature of Islam as recurring themes. Kim Stanley Robinson The Years of Rice and Salt belongs to the alternate history subgenre of speculative fiction. The novel starts at the point of divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe where the Black Death killed 99 of Europe's population, instead of a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in AD 1405 807 AH to about AD 2045 1467 AH with Mughal Emperor Akbar being the last character with a real world counterpart. Robinson's take on alternate history is that because it is set in the same lawful universe as ours, its science must be the same because its people have the same basic human needs, their societies resemble ours. Therefore, despite the difference in who specifically is there, the great majority of humanity doing their work, and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve the problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world. While most alternate histories use the Great Man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and big events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of historical theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place. This is reflected in the title of the novel, The Years of Rice and Salt, which refers to the everyday chores of raising a family, often performed by women, despite the politics and wars of men. Reviewers noted this allows for the history experienced by readers on a human scale and an implicit but thorough rebuke to the kind of war gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody. The novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy, theology, history, and scientific theory. Chauncy Mabe, Books Editor, South Florida Sun Sentinel Released in March 2002, the book was published in North America by Bantam Books and in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in 2003 along with a Spanish translation. In the subsequent years, other translated versions were published, in French, Polish, Chinese, and Hungarian. The novel was well received by critics who variously called it thoughtful , realistic , and rich . In Publishers Weekly, the reviewers called it a highly realistic and credible alternate history , and in the School Library Journal, Christine Menefee called it an addictive, surprising, and suspenseful novel . The Library Journal highly recommended it, saying that its superb storytelling and imaginative historic speculation make a priority choice for all SF and general fiction collections . The critic at Kirkus Reviews found it overlong, but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty . Likewise, Roz Kaveney stated that if there is a weakness in Robinson's work, it is perhaps this his characters are so intelligent that they never shut up . For The Globe and Mail, Sol Chrom lauded the epic scope, calling it a magnificent achievement , and for The Belfast News Letter, the reviewer called the novel extraordinary, ambitious, poetic and powerful . Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid concluded that it is a huge, complex and highly enjoyable book . It won the 2003 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the British Science Fiction Award.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Years%20of%20Rice%20and%20Salt

It received five stars from About.com, praising the songs Georgia Rain , Who Invented the Wheel , and Standing Out in a Crowd . The album became her third to reach number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. It also peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200, selling 117,000 copies within its first week. Its first week sales eclipsed those of Paul McCartney's Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, which was released within the same week. The first single, Georgia Rain , peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming her first major hit since 2002. The second single, Trying to Love You was released to radio October 31, reaching number 52. Within a month of the album's release, Jasper County certified gold from the RIAA, becoming Yearwood's eleventh Gold certification of her career. In May 2007, Yearwood announced her departure from MCA Nashville Records and her signing with the independent label Big Machine Records. Yearwood and the label's CEO, Scott Borchetta met when she originally worked for MTM Records in the late 1980s. She then worked with Borchetta at MCA during the 1990s. Following her separation, MCA released a Greatest Hits compilation, which included her major hits between 1991 and 2001. After signing with the label, Yearwood announced plans for the recording of her tenth studio album. In November 2007, she released Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love. The album peaked at number ten on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and reached number thirty on the Billboard 200. The album received critical acclaim. AllMusic gave the project four and a half out of five stars, calling it their album pick . Reviewer, Thom Jurek stated, It's better than good, it's beyond expectation and it was high after Jasper County it's the best example of what a popular record not just a country one should aspire to be, period. Slant Magazine also reviewed the record, giving it four and a half stars, calling it a testament to the vitality, intelligence, and soulfulness of modern country's best music. The title track was released as the first single in July 2007, peaking at number 19 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second single, This Is Me You're Talking To was released in January 2008. The song received critical acclaim, notably from Engine 145, who called it one of the best singles of the year . After beginning a successful Food Network cooking show and several cookbooks, Yearwood went into hiatus from her solo music career. Although she did not focus on solo projects, she remained active in the music industry. From 2009 to 2014, Yearwood accompanied husband Garth Brooks in his concert residency called Garth at Wynn. The residence was located at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yearwood performed songs as a guest artist in the show. The Las Vegas production ran for three years, closing in 2014. In 2014, Yearwood joined Brooks on his three year world tour entitled The Garth Brooks World Tour. During this same time, she briefly embarked on her own brief tour called Just Because . In August 2014, Yearwood briefly signed with RCA Records Nashville. Her only album for the label was the 2014 compilation PrizeFighter Hit After Hit. It contained 16 of her major hits re recorded for the album and several new songs. The title track was released as the lead single and featured guest vocals from Kelly Clarkson. The album debuted at number 7 on the Billboard country albums chart and the lead single peaked at number 42 on the Billboard country songs chart. In 2016, Yearwood appeared in the live television musical The Passion. As a result, she was also featured on the event's soundtrack, performing new versions of several well known songs including Hands , My Love Is Your Love , You'll Never Walk Alone and Broken . Broken became Yearwood's first hit on the Christian charts, peaking at number 47 and also reaching number 17 on the Adult Contemporary charts. In late 2016 she joined Garth Brooks on their first collaborative studio album titled Christmas Together. The album featured covers of classic holiday songs and an original track written by the pair called What I'm Thankful for The Thanksgiving Song . Following this, Yearwood was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on the song Forever Country . The song was created to celebrate 50 years of the CMA Awards. In late 2018 Yearwood announced the release of a new album consisting of songs previously recorded by Frank Sinatra. Titled Let's Be Frank, it was recorded live at the Capitol Records building and was backed by a full piece orchestra. Yearwood used Sinatra's original microphone during the recording process. It was released in December 2018, exclusively at Williams Sonoma stores, and worldwide on February 14, 2019. The album peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. In his review, Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe praised the release, giving it four of five possible stars. In discussing the album, Coyne commented, Lets Be Frank is a delightful detour, and while it doesnt curb the hunger for more country music from the greatest female artist of the greatest generation of female artists, it is chock full of reminders of how she earned that distinction in the first place. In 2019, Yearwood announced plans for a new studio album Every Girl to be released. Its lead single Every Girl in This Town was issued on June 6, 2019. The song debuted at number 21 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated June 15, 2019, marking the highest chart debut of her career, surpassing the number 36 start for Love Will Always Win in 2006. Every Girl is scheduled to be released on August 30, 2019, and will feature collaborations with Garth Brooks, Kelly Clarkson, and Don Henley. Yearwood will go on her first solo tour in five years in support of the new album. The Every Girl on Tour launches on October 3, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee, and will hit 22 cities before wrapping in December. In April 2008, Yearwood released her first cookbook co written with her mother Gwen and sister Beth Georgia Cooking in an Oklahoma Kitchen. The cookbook included other recipes passed down from her family and liner notes describing each recipe. In total, 120 recipes were included. The book contained recipes for such foods as fried chicken, ribs, meatloaf, and cheesecake. Garth Brooks wrote the book's foreword, stating how he was always fond of her cooking style. Georgia Cooking reached number 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Yearwood then stated plans to publish a second cookbook. On April 6, 2010, she collaborated again with her mother and sister to release Home Cooking with Trisha Yearwood. The book contained recipes passed down through her mother, aunts, cousins and longtime friends. Yearwood stated that she dedicated many of the cookbook's recipes to relatives, such as Brooks, who also provided the foreword. Home Cooking would also reach number 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Yearwood's cookbook was the cover article for the April 2010 issue of Redbook Magazine, where she explained that many of the recipes featured in the cookbook were some of the best memories of her childhood . Later that year, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine included Home Cooking with Trisha Yearwood on their list of The Five Worst Cookbooks of 2010 , noting its recipes are loaded with fat and cholesterol , specifically citing one called Garth's Breakfast Bowl which includes eight large eggs, a pound each of bacon and sausage, cheese tortellini, cheddar cheese, tater tots, and B.O.B Bowl Of Butter . In 2012, Yearwood announced plans to film a cooking show. Trisha's Southern Kitchen premiered on the Food Network on April 14, 2012. The original six episodes were filmed in Nashville, Tennessee. The show received a positive response from viewers. According to Food Network's senior vice president, viewers enjoyed seeing different sides of Yearwood Our viewers loved seeing a different side of Trisha. Her impressive cooking skills and family recipes, coupled with her natural southern charm, really resonated with our audience...Were thrilled Trisha will be returning for a second season with more delicious dishes and family traditions. In 2013, Trisha's Southern Kitchen won an Emmy award for Outstanding Culinary Program . The show has since been nominated for additional Emmy accolades. In a 2017 interview, Yearwood stated that she would like to continue hosting the program for as long as she can. In 1997, Yearwood began playing a recurring role on the CBS military drama JAG, where she played Lieutenant Commander Teresa Coulter, a Navy coroner and forensic specialist, who develops feelings for one of the main characters. She appeared on the show at various times until 2002. In addition, Yearwood also guest starred in the television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman in 1994 as a choir director. Yearwood has also stated she is interested in performing in a Broadway musical, but not anytime soon . She appeared in an episode of TLC's Who Do You Think You Are on September 3, 2013. In March 2016, Yearwood appeared as Mary in the live television musical The Passion based on the Dutch franchise of the same name. The show is a contemporary retelling of the Passion of Jesus Christ set to popular music with a mixture of live and pre recorded segments. The event was broadcast live on Fox. The show received mixed reviews. In one interview by Robert Bianco of USA Today, Yearwood's Mary may have been singing about Jesus, but she never interacted with him. While he was mostly seen in segments shot around the city, she sang to the crowd gathered in front of that big white stage, belting out You'll Never Walk Alone to no one in particular. A review by Entertainment Weekly called Yearwood's performance of the songs she performed expressive , but lacking the live elements as it was filmed through pre recorded scenes. Her musical tastes originated from classic artists her parents listened to. This included Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette. However, as Yearwood developed into her teenage years, she developed a liking for country rock artists such as Allman Brothers and James Taylor. She also cited the Eagles and Gordon Lightfoot as influences. According to Yearwood, her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt. She discovered her music after her parents bought her Ronstadt's studio album Simple Dreams. Yearwood commented to the Wall Street Journal that while Ronstadt's music was considered pop, her phrasing and emotional style appeared country. Music critics and writers have drawn similarities between Ronstadt and Yearwood's voice. In an interview for Ronstadt's album Feels Like Home, Peter Galvin of Rolling Stone commented, Listening to Yearwoods new album, Thinkin About You, you would sometimes swear you were hearing Ronstadt circa 1976. Yearwood's voice is thinner and more pliable than Ronstadt's, but both resort to a hearty squawk when passion takes them over, and both possess low honey tones. She also reported to be influenced by Emmylou Harris. Yearwood once commented, I've had to say to myself, well, if I passed Emmylou Harris on the street, would I be able to hold my head up Yearwood's musical style has been considered country pop and adult contemporary . Additionally, her artistic choices have been considered unique from writers because of song choice and quality. When ranking her top 10 songs, staff from The Boot magazine explained her musical quality, Yearwood has carved out a very successful and unique niche for herself by finding some of the highest quality songs in the genre, then recording them in arrangements that bring them to life in a way that is sonically different from any other artist in the commercial country marketplace. Laura McClellan of Taste of Country explained that it is Yearwood's diverse musical styles that make her music quality and career successful. McClellan also noted, Her songs have shaped country music particularly for female artists for decades. Yearwood has participated in various philanthropic events. She recorded a version of My Favorite Things for the Sears Heroes at Home program in 2008. The song was available for download via the Sears website. The project supported the families of service men and women during the Christmas holiday season. Yearwood has been an active member of the charity home building group Habitat for Humanity. Yearwood first joined with husband Garth Brooks in 2006. They assisted in the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief by building flood walls in New Orleans and protective structures in Mississippi. Between May 2 to 10, 2009, Yearwood participated in National Women Build Week near her home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The project saw two hundred crews of women learn to build houses in Atlanta, Georgia and Oklahoma. For the project, Yearwood learned to construct and build simple and affordable houses for Habitat for Humanity construction sites nationwide. On Mother's Day, Yearwood, her sister, mother and niece joined the project as well. Many of these Habitat for Humanity projects have been collaborations with former president Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter. Yearwood married her first husband, Chris Latham, in 1987. The pair divorced in 1991. In 1994, she married Bobby Reynolds, a bassist for The Mavericks. During their marriage, the couple lived in a log cabin styled home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The pair divorced in 1999 after five years of marriage. Yearwood commented that the separation was difficult in a 1999 interview with Country Weekly, Since I do hang on to the past with my fingernails, divorce was difficult...Its a serious decision involving someone youre tied to emotionally, so its hard to move on. And its easy to drag things out so you dont have to face people talking about you. Yearwood and Garth Brooks had been friends and musical partners before romantically seeing each other. According to Brooks, his first encounter with Yearwood felt like that feeling when you just meet your wife . During this period, Yearwood and Brooks were both married to separate people. For these reasons, they remained friends during the first half of their careers. Following Brooks's divorce and Yearwood's second divorce, the two began dating around 2002. They became engaged in 2005 when Brooks proposed to Yearwood onstage amidst a crowd of 7,000 in Bakersfield, California. The pair married on December 13, 2005. The wedding took place at the couple's home in Owasso, Oklahoma. Brooks's three children were also part of the wedding ceremony. According to Yearwood, the pair made a commitment not to spend time apart. It is estimated by Yearwood that the couple spends about 5 days away from each other per year. In an interview with People Magazine she explained this further, We really have made a conscious effort since getting married to not be apart, so weve toured together. If Im doing something, hell be with me, even if you dont see him, hell be in the hotel or around...And were not always together, but weve been married before, and we decided we dont want to be apart. So lets make an effort to make sure thats our priority and weve been able to do it. She became a stepmother to Brooks's three children following their marriage. In an 2017 interview, Yearwood explained her new role, I had no idea what I was doing. I have to say that now as these girls have growntheyre adults now on their ownits been a part of my life that I would have never would have even known to dream about and its been so rewarding to get to be a part of this family. Yearwood has received many awards and nominations. This includes 3 Grammy Awards , 3 Academy of Country Music awards , 3 Country Music Association awards , and 1 Daytime Emmy award .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisha%20Yearwood
"Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on June 18, 2013, through Def Jam Recordings. West gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for production on the album, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. Yeezus also features guest vocals from Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank Ocean. Fifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Yeezus has been characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. It also continues West's unconventional use of samples, as on Blood on the Leaves , which contains a sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of Strange Fruit . The release features no album artwork, and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances. West released two singles from the album, the song Black Skinhead in July 2013 and Bound 2 the following month. Yeezus received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it among West's best work and commended its brash direction, though public response was divided. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in its first week of release. It charted in 30 other countries, including also topping the charts in the United Kingdom and Australia. Yeezus was nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album. As of 2016, the album has sold 750,000 copies in the United States. Following the release of his fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 2010 , West collaborated with longtime friend Jay Z on Watch the Throne 2011 . In July 2012, producer No I.D. revealed that he had been working on West's sixth solo studio album and seventh overall and that it would be released after Cruel Summer 2012 , a collaborative compilation album between members of West's record label GOOD Music. For Yeezus, West enlisted several collaborators, including Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, S1, The Heatmakerz, Mike Dean, Hudson Mohawke, Skrillex, Young Chop, Chief Keef, Frank Ocean, Odd Future, Travis Scott, The Dream, Cyhi the Prynce, Malik Yusef, King L, John Legend, James Blake, RZA, Mase, and Pusha T. The album features additional vocals by Justin Vernon, Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi, Chief Keef, King L, Assassin, and Charlie Wilson. West was influenced primarily by minimalist design and architecture during the production of Yeezus, and visited a furniture exhibit in the Louvre five times. A single Le Corbusier lamp was his greatest inspiration . West worked closely with the architect Oana Stanescu, and took field trips to Le Corbusier homes. Fascinated by Stanescu's comments on the unusual and radical nature of Corbusier design choices, West applied the situation to his own life, feeling that visionaries can be misunderstood by their unenlightened peers . West also met with architect Joseph Dirand and Belgian interior designer Axel Vervoordt, and had rare Le Corbusier lamps, Pierre Jeanneret chairs and obscure body art journals from Switzerland delivered to the loft. West also wanted a deep hometown influence on the album, and listened to 1980s house music most associated with his home city of Chicago for influence. Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain was also an inspiration for the album. In 2012, West began recording his seventh studio album with collaborators, including No I.D. and DJ Khaled. The first recordings were held in January 2013, in the living room of his personal loft at a Paris hotel, referred to in the album's credits as the No Name Hotel . West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album. The atmosphere in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as very focused , and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive group atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return the next day to sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had, and it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that. Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, it would all be edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, he kind of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to undermine the commercial , several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no bass wobbles reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as very raw by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was rapping kind of screaming primally, actually . While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as the fastest record we ever made . In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the final product , only later to be changed describing the album as dark . W writer Christopher Bagley reports that West's creative process often bordered on perfectionist. In March 2013, West described the album to Bagley as near completion, only to revise this statement one month later to only 30 percent complete . West made several last minute alterations to Yeezus, enlisting the co founder of Def Jam Recordings, Rick Rubin, as an executive producer for additional recording mere days before its release changes included re recording whole songs and rewriting entire verses. The rough cut West played Rubin ran nearly three and a half hours long. West's orders to Rubin were to take the music in a stripped down minimal direction , often removing elements already recorded. For several days in late May and early June 2013, West and a rotating group of intimates, collaborators and hangers on holed up at Rubin's Shangri La Studio in Malibu in service of completing the record. Rubin thought it impossible to meet the deadline and all involved ended up working long hours with no days off in order to complete the record. West had intended the album be 16 tracks until Rubin suggested cutting the album down to fewer tracks. Rubin gave as example Bound , which was a more middle of the road R B song, done in an adult contemporary style before Kanye decided to replace the musical backing with a minimalistic sample, a single note bassline in the hook which we processed to have a punk edge in the Suicide tradition. Two days before the album had to be delivered to the label, West wrote and sung lyrics to two songs while also recording the vocals to three others in just two hours. Rubin also suggested to reduce the album from sixteen songs to just ten, saying the others could be reserved for a follow up. According to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot, Yeezus is a hostile, abrasive and intentionally off putting album that combines the worlds of 1980s Chicago acid house, 2013 Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the avant rap of Saul Williams, Death Grips, and Odd Future. The Independent, Mass Appeal, and The Village Voice described it as an experimental release, while Meagan Garvey of The Outline described it as West's industrial album . Rolling Stone described it as an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip hop, drone y wooz and industrial gear grind, while Vulture called it a punk rap opus , and Rolling Stone called it an industrial rap opus . Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself, writing that West reconceives the notion of what kind of music or noise can underpin hip hop . According to Charles Aaron of Spin, Yeezus is a hip hop album, not a rap album , because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together, and although listeners can hear 'punk' or 'post punk' or industrial' throughout, hip hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation . The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music. The record most closely resembles 1990s industrial rock, during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact, with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Marilyn Manson gaining success. The industrial scene created a vast global underground community , and Esquire notes that one of its epicenters was in Chicago, where West was raised. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop. West, himself would later go onto describe the sound of the album as a protest to music . Yeezus is primarily electronic in nature, and boasts distorted drum machines and synthesizers that sound like they're malfunctioning, low resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds. To this end, the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of CD skips or corrupted MP3's, and Auto Tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher. Esquire cites On Sight as an early example of the album's connection to electronic music, citing its droning synthesizer tone , which is modulated until the signal starts throwing off harshly treble heavy spikes and begins to clip, as if it were overloading a digital audio processor. Yeezus continues West's practice of eclectic samples he employs an obscure Hindi sample on I Am a God , and a sample of 1970s Hungarian rock group Omega on New Slaves . On Sight interpolates a melody from Sermon He'll Give Us What We Really Need by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family, although the track originally sampled an old vocal track from the original recording. As late as a week prior to release, lawyers were forced to track down the choir director and members of the choir on the South Side of Chicago in order to get clearance for such a sample. Def Jam executives were significantly worried enough the deal would not be in place in time for the record's deadline, and producers re recorded the vocals with a new choir as the sample could not be cleared in enough time. Bound 2 features heavy soul music samples and has been described as the only song on Yeezus which recalls the sound of West's early work. Bound , a 1971 song by American soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One from their album 2 2 1 Ponderosa Twins Plus One, serves as the primary sample used in West's track. The album's second track Black Skinhead has alternately been called an industrial hip hop song and a galloping punk rap manifesto . I Am a God was inspired by a diss from a major fashion designer, who informed West of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on the condition he agree to not attend other shows. I'm In It began with a different sample and melody, but West removed the sample and Rubin edited the track down from a six minute arrangement. Blood on the Leaves , which samples Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of Strange Fruit and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list, is an example of West's signature dichotomy in which he melds the sacred and profane. Strange Fruit , first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939, brought the lynchings of black Americans to a startling poignancy , creating one of the most towering, important songs of the 20th century . West's anthemic re telling instead details an MDMA fueled hookup and the perils of fame. On May 1, 2013, West used the social networking site Twitter to post a single message reading June Eighteen , leading several media outlets to speculate that the post referred to the release date of West's upcoming album. On May 17, he began promotion of the album by unveiling the previously unreleased song New Slaves through video projections in 66 assorted locations. The following day, West appeared on the American late night live television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live and performed the songs New Slaves and Black Skinhead . He subsequently revealed the album's cover and title, Yeezus, on his official website. The iTunes Store made Yeezus available for pre order on May 20, but the listing was subsequently taken down for unknown reasons. On May 29, A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou unveiled an advertisement for Yeezus which stated that the album would not be available for pre order. Speaking about the album's minimal promotion, West stated With this album, we ain't drop no single to radio. We ain't got no NBA campaign, nothing like that. Shit, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music. The physical CD edition of Yeezus was released in a clear jewel box with no album artwork, reflecting the minimalist tone. The packaging consists of little more than a piece of red tape and a sticker affixed to the back, with sample credits and the album's UPC. Other versions of this release have different colors of stickers, with green, yellow and orange being some of the other colors. The front is affixed with a Parental Advisory label. The Source pointed out a resemblance between the Yeezus CD packaging and a packaging concept designed for the single Crystal by the English band New Order in 2001. Def Jam confirmed in late June 2013 that Black Skinhead would be serviced to American radio as the album's first single on July 2, 2013 and that a music video for the track was being produced. It was officially released to radio in the United Kingdom on June 19. The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and 34 on the UK Singles Chart. In August 2013, it was revealed that Bound 2 would be released as the second single from Yeezus. Bound 2 features vocals from American soul singer Charlie Wilson and incorporates numerous samples into its production, including prominent elements of the song Bound 1971 by soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One. Bound 2 received general acclaim from music critics, who referred to the song as one of the highlights of the album and compared its soul sample based production to West's early work from his debut studio album The College Dropout. The song has since peaked at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. In November 2013, producer Hudson Mohawke revealed that Blood on the Leaves would serve as the album's third single. West subsequently made the announcement in an interview on New York's 92.3 NOW. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced The Yeezus Tour, a North American tour to take place between October 19 through December 7, 2013. The tour was marketed as his first solo tour in 5 years , and featured Kendrick Lamar, Pusha T, A Tribe Called Quest, and Travis Scott as a supporting acts. On October 30, 2013, while on the road to Vancouver, a truck carrying custom made video screens and equipment for the show was involved in a car accident, the crash damaged the equipment beyond repair. The tour resumed on November 16, 2013, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The missed Chicago and Detroit shows were rescheduled however, the rest of the missed dates were cancelled, Def Jam cited routing logistics as the reason. Yeezus was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 46 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic gave Yeezus 8.2 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Reviewing the album in The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis found it noisy, gripping, maddening, potent , while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph said it was the most exciting album she had heard in some time. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a brilliant, obsessive compulsive career auto correct that made other abrasive records by mad geniuses , such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead's Kid A, seem tame by comparison. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a razor sharpened take on West's fourth album, 808s Heartbreak, concluding that cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, perhaps more than any other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the album's fast 40 minutes. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet, and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said it was his most uninhibited record Even by the standards of an artist who reinvents himself with each release, it's a drastic departure. In the opinion of AllMusic's David Jeffries, the album was an extravagant stunt with the high art packed in, offering an eccentric, audacious, and gripping experience that's vital and truly unlike anything else. Rock artist Lou Reed reviewed Yeezus in July 2013 shortly before his death, describing it as majestic and inspiring. He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's not even on the same planet. Some reviewers expressed reservations. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said West's innovative transfiguration of his musicwith unrefined electronica and drill elementswas undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits . In Robert Christgau's opinion, the combination of harsh rock and hip hop sounds on Yeezus was as bold as Public Enemy's music during the 1980s, but West's lyrics were grotesquely off putting. He's wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery is very hard to take , Christgau wrote in The Barnes Noble Review, describing the album as an alt rap also ran . Chris Richards from The Washington Post found West's lyricism perhaps his least compelling yet and drunk on bitterness , while Alex Griffin of Tiny Mix Tapes described the record as a nebulous, dense, paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that's utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much you care about Yeezy. In The Times, Will Hodgkinson surmised that Yeezus could have been West's masterpiece had he not become so hopelessly self important . Based on 146 individual year end top ten lists compiled by Metacritic, Yeezus was the most critically acclaimed album of 2013, appearing on 61 lists and being named first on 18 of them. In October 2013, Complex named Yeezus the sixth best hip hop album of the last five years. Yeezus was rated as album of the year by nine publications. Spin named it the best album of 2013, writing, Yeezus was a thorny tangram puzzle of boxy headbanger blats that exemplified a year of equally stripped down, basal pleasures. The A.V. Club named it the best album of 2013 saying It's magnificent, and it sounds like absolutely nothing else . Rolling Stone named it the second best album of 2013, comparing it in concept to Reed's polarizing 1975 album Metal Machine Music No wonder the late, great Lou Reed embraced Yeezus, since it's basically the Metal Machine Music concept translated into futuristic hip hop, all industrial overload and hypertense egomania and hostile vibes. Exclaim also named it the hip hop album of the year. NME named it the second best album of the year calling it his most sonically challenging album to date . Stereogum, Time, and Complex also named Yeezus the best album of 2013. Yeezus was also nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for New Slaves . West responded unfavorably to this due to not receiving more nominations. He then addressed the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at one of his concerts and referred to it as patronizing. The album received nominations for Foreign Rap Album of the Year at the Hungarian Music Awards, International Album of the Year at the Danish Music Awards, World's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards, and Best Album at the 2014 NME Awards. The Pitchfork online music publication ranked Yeezus in the eighth position of a list of the best 100 albums of the decade so far between 2010 and 2014on August 19, 2014. In January 2014, Yeezus was named the best album of 2013 by The Village Voice's Pazz Jop annual critics' poll this is the fourth instance that a Kanye West album has topped the poll, after The College Dropout, Late Registration, and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2004, 2005, and 2010, respectively. On the same poll for singles, Bound 2 , New Slaves , and Black Skinhead were ranked in the top 10. In 2015 Way Too Indie named it the album of the decade thus far. Within one day of availability on the iTunes Store, Yeezus topped sales in the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany, while remaining at number two in the United States behind J. Cole's Born Sinner. It would eventually have chart topping performances in the United Kingdom, where Yeezus debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on downloads alone, making the album West's first number one on that chart since Graduation in 2007, and Australia, where it became West's first album to top the ARIA Charts. Yeezus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 327,000 copies in the United States in its first week. The album failed to reach the 500,000 sales projections, and marked West's lowest solo opening week sales in the US. However, it still had the third best first week sales of 2013 at the time of its release and the best first week sales by a hip hop album since Drake's 2011 album Take Care. The second week sales saw the album fall dramatically although it still ended at number three on the chart, sales dropped by 80 to 65,000 units, making Yeezus the largest second week percentage drop for a number one debuting album in 201213 and the fourth largest for a number one bowing album in the SoundScan era. Billboard's Keith Caulfield attributed the diminished figures to the non traditional marketing, considering that the lack of singles and public appearances led the album to find difficulty in sustaining its momentum . On August 12, 2013, The album was certified gold for sales of over 500,000 copies. On January 8, 2014, it was certified platinum for shipments of one million albums shipped to stores and digital retailers. As of February 2016, the album has sold 750,000 copies in the United States. In Australia, Yeezus debuted at number two with sales of 9,500. 'Yeezus debuted behind The Great Country Songbook by Troy Cassar Daley and Adam Harvey. However, after a data error was found, a re count of sales was done. The re count found that Yeezus was actually the number one album of the week. ARIA issued an apology and the chart was fixed. Yeezus was ranked as the thirty seven most popular album of 2013 on the Billboard 200. Public reaction to Yeezus, including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion as well as its brash and aggressive sound, was mixed. Yeezus was noted as one of the most anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications, but the lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move. Regardless, radio stations have still played tracks from Yeezus on air, despite it being a departure from the normal playlists found on hip hop stations. When I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more, stated West at his headlining June 9, 2013 Governor's Ball performance, where he unveiled several tracks from the record for the first time. Rolling Stone summarized the audience's response Half the crowd cheered, half almost audibly rolled their eyes. West's June 11 interview with Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was similarly viewed with a mixed reaction, with many outlets mocking West's seemingly vain statements. In the article, West compares himself to Apple co founder Steve Jobs and refers to himself as the nucleus of all society . Within four days prior to the release, Yeezus was leaked online. The New York Times wrote that the leak stirred up a Twitter frenzy and received widespread media coverage. The Washington Post commented on the significance of the leak Kanye Wests new album didnt leak online over the weekend. It gushed out into the pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude ominous, mesmerizing and of great consequence. Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as musical and commercial suicide , and fans live blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook . The New Yorker's Sasha Frere Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the lean vibrancy of the album. One of the most fascinating aspects of Yeezus' arrival is the discursive crisis it's caused, produced by a fast react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding, wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton. West was criticized by the UK and US Parkinson's disease Associations for controversial lyrics in lead song On Sight . In February 2014, English singer Lily Allen announced that she would title her third studio album Sheezus. In an interview with Australian radio station Nova, Allen stated that she is terrified that West would think it's a diss rather than a tribute . She said that she thinks West is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all the time. Jack White, a vocal advocate of analog recording, remarked that the album is obviously recorded on Pro Tools but sounds unbelievable, because it is very simple and there aren't a lot of components going on, and this really allows the songs to shine. Plus he mixed using analogue components. Notes Sample credits Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.

"Yehudi lights are lamps of automatically controlled brightness placed on the front and leading edges of an aircraft to raise the aircraft's luminance to the average brightness of the sky, a form of active camouflage using counter illumination. They were designed to camouflage the aircraft by preventing it from appearing as a dark object against the sky. The technology was developed by the US Navy from 1943 onwards, to enable a sea search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to within 30 seconds of flying time before becoming visible to the submarine's crew. This in turn enabled the aircraft to engage the submarine with depth charges before it could dive, to counter the threat from German submarines to allied shipping. The concept was based on earlier research by the Royal Canadian Navy in its diffused lighting camouflage project. Yehudi lights did not come into operational usage and were considered obsolete with postwar advances in radar. With more recent improvements in stealth technology, Yehudi lights have again attracted interest. The use of Yehudi lights to camouflage aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering experiments in the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish he realized that the reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production. An equivalent active camouflage strategy, known to zoologists as counter illumination, is used by many marine organisms, including fish, shrimps, and cephalopods such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies the intensity of the light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage by painting out the animal's silhouette with light. Yehudi lights were developed by the US Navy to help counter the menace of German submarines to Allied shipping in the North Atlantic. The United States Army Air Force's Director Of Technical Services DTS asked the camouflage section of the National Defence Research Committee NDRC to develop a camouflage method that would allow a radar equipped, sea search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to within 30 seconds' flight time before being seen. This was to enable the aircraft to drop its depth charges before the submarine could dive. British researchers had found that the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive and that externally mounted light projectors following the Canadian approach unacceptably disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics. The DTS, and through him the NDRC, were informed, in line with the Canadian findings, that even a white aircraft would normally appear dark against the sky. They were further told that while floodlighting the aircraft in the manner of diffused lighting camouflage for ships could in theory make it bright enough to match its background, that would require an impossibly large amount of electrical power but a less power hungry option was available, namely to use forward facing lights, and to require the aircraft to fly within 3 degrees of the line directly towards the submarine, so that only its counter illuminated front would face the enemy. Pilots noted that in a crosswind, the nose of the plane would not point directly at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight line path with the nose pointed upwind. The NDRC estimated that lights could be spaced up to about 4 feet 1.2 m apart without becoming visible as individual objects at a distance of 2 miles 3.2 km . On this basis, it calculated that a large aircraft like a B 24 Liberator bomber could be camouflaged against the sky for a power consumption of under 500 watts. The key technology investigated under Yehudi was therefore the use of forward facing lights to anti submarine and attack aircraft. To improve confidence in the approach, the project made a prototype in the form of a counter illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers 100 feet 30 m at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level 2 miles 3.2 km away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the 1 inch 2.5 cm thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was completely invisible with the lamps correctly adjusted. The Yehudi project therefore used forward pointing lamps mounted in the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their brightness controlled by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match the brightness of the sky. One photocell pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945. By directing the light forwards towards an observer rather than towards the aircraft's skin , the system provided effective and efficient counter illumination camouflage, more like that of marine animals such as the firefly squid than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. However, the system never entered active service. Yehudi Lights raise the average brightness of a Grumman Avenger from a dark shape to the same as the sky. Yehudi Lights plan for counter illumination camouflage of a B 24 Liberator, showing lights spaced along leading edges and front of fuselage In 1945 a Grumman Avenger with Yehudi lights got within 3,000 yards 2,700 m of a ship before being sighted, when under the same conditions an uncamouflaged plane was detected at a range of about 12 miles 19 km . It was noted at the time that this would force the enemy either to give up radar silence, making submarines easy to locate but harder to approach, or for observers to use binoculars continually. Since 8x binoculars at the time had a field of view of only 5 degrees, whereas enemy submarines at the surface kept watch with three observers each assigned a 120 degree arc, the camouflage was considered effective. The ability to approach a target unseen was rendered obsolete by advances in radar in the 1940s and 1950s. Since the development of stealth technology, Yehudi lights have attracted renewed interest, first in 1973 when McDonnell Douglas researched a Quiet Attack aircraft for the Office of Naval Research, modifying the F 4 Phantom with Yehudi lights on its underside, and later in the 1970s when Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works was contracted to develop a stealth aircraft prototype Have Blue, which helped to guide the development of the F 117A stealth fighter and the B 2 stealth bomber. The Have Blue prototype was disruptively camouflaged to disguise its shape from casual onlookers, as well as being constructed of angled facets to reduce its radar cross section. The use of any form of active camouflage, whether Yehudi lights or microwave emissions, was however rejected.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi%20lights
"The Yellala Falls Rapides de Yelala or Chutes Yelala also spelled as Ielala are a series of waterfalls and rapids on the Congo River just upstream from Matadi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The falls are the lowest of a long series of rapids that render the river unnavigable, forcing colonial explorers to travel by foot as far as the Stanley Pool 350 kilometres 220 mi upstream. The Congo is the third largest river in the world by volume of water discharged, and the deepest in the world. The section of river that ends with the Yellala falls has over 300 species of fish, many found nowhere else. The region drained by the Congo River covers one eighth of Africa, including both tropical rain forest and savanna, much of it in a huge, shallow basin. The present system of rivers seems to date from around five million years ago, not long ago on a geological time scale. At that time the Atlantic continental margin was lifted up and formed a barrier between the basin and the sea. A large lake formed before the Congo River broke through this barrier, running through a narrow, rocky channel about 350 kilometres 220 mi long from Kinshasa to Matadi. The river is navigable both above and below this stretch, called the lower Congo. The upper portion of the Lower Congo starts with the steep Livingstone Falls just below Kinshasa and continues for 133 kilometres 83 mi through a number of smaller rapids. The central portion of about 129 kilometres 80 mi is navigable, at times lake like and at times narrow and as deep as 200 metres 660 ft . The lower portion of about 88 kilometres 55 mi is the steepest, with huge rapids at the Inga Falls and again at the Yellala falls, after which the river is navigable to the ocean. About 1,250,000 cubic feet 35,000 m3 of water flows over the falls each second. The Yellala Falls were reached by Europeans as early as 1485, when the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cao took a group of men as far as the falls before they were forced to turn back by disease, probably malaria. In that place he set a padrao, a large stone cross shaped marker, customary during the Portuguese Age of Discovery. The stone, which was not rediscovered until 1911, bears the words Aqui chegaram os navios do esclarecido rei D.Joao II de Portugal Diogo Cao, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa. Here arrived the ships of illustrious John II, King of Portugal Diogo Cao, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa . Captain James Hingston Tuckey visited in 1816. He said that the local people thought the falls were the residence of an evil spirit, and that anyone who saw them would never see them again. Visiting in the dry season, he was disappointed by the falls. He described the site as comprising a large hill of syenite, a course grained igneous rock, on the south side. The northern side, made of the same material, was not as high, but steeper than the south. He described the river as having forced its course and within the middle of the river an island of slate still defies its power, and breaks the current into two narrow channels that near the south side gives vent to a great mass of water, over which the torrent rushes with great fury and noise, as may easily be conceived . Tuckey, who was sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society of London to obtain information on the slave trade, noted the brutality of the Portuguese slave trade and gathered valuable information about the geography, animals, plants, minerals and people of the region. Talking of the people who lived above the falls, Tuckey said that fowls, eggs, manioc and fruits were the property of women. The items were never dealt with by the men without a discussion with their wives. Beads were given as presents from the men. In 1848 the Hungarian Laszlo Magyar ascended the Congo to the Yellala falls, before spending five years exploring the region to the south. Due to his lack of contact with the outside world, the valuable information that he gathered received little circulation. Sir Richard Francis Burton, who first saw the falls in 1863, wrote a description of the great Yellala. Waves developed in the course of the river for a mile and a half above . Afterwards, the water heads down a slope of around thirty feet in 300 yards, spuming, colliding and throwing up foam, which looks dingy white against the dull yellow brown of the less disturbed channel the movement is that of waves dashing upon a pier . He went on The old river valley, shown by the scarp of the rocks, must have presented gigantic features, and the height of the trough walls, at least a thousand feet, gives the Yellala a certain beauty and grandeur. The site is apparently the highest axis of the dividing ridge separating the maritime lowlands from the inner plateau . The explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who visited the falls on April 6, 1880, wrote that over a five or six mile stretch the incline was only 45 feet 14 m , but that the general fury of the water is caused by the obstructions which the giant volume meets in the bed of the narrow defile. Sir Harry Johnston, who visited the falls in 1883, called the river the last grand fall of Yellala and detailed the sight and sounds of his impression of the falls. The Yellala Falls and the other falls and rapids upstream have largely isolated the aquatic fauna of the Congo Basin for around five million years, a significant period on an evolutionary timescale. The cichlid genera Steatocranus, Nanochromis, Lamprologus and Teleogramma are found only in the Congo basin. Several dozen species in these genera are found only in the lower Congo. Steatocranus are rheophilic, meaning they have adapted to living in fast water. The four species of Teleogramma are found only in the lower Congo rapids. Genetically distinct populations have been found on opposite sides of the river. Although only 1 mile 1.6 km apart, powerful currents that may exceed 30 miles per hour 48 km h have prevented interbreeding.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellala%20Falls
"Yellow is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. The band wrote the song and co produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album, Parachutes 2000 . The song was recorded in March 2000 and released in June that same year as the second single from Parachutes, following Shiver, and the lead single in the United States. Yellow reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, giving Coldplay their first top five hit in the United Kingdom. It was Coldplay's breakthrough hit internationally, reaching number one in Iceland, number five in Australia, number nine in Ireland and number 48 in the United States. Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song thrust the band into popularity. Yellow has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide, and remains one of the band's most popular songs. Yellow was written in Rockfield's Quadrangle studio in south Wales, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after finishing recording Shiver , the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and just amazing , according to the song's co producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice . Martin has said, The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice. The melody started off a lot slower , according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, and it sort of got a bit heavier . While composing the song's lyrics, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing keyword in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song Yellow as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line Look at the stars . That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it. A much different origin of the song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck with him for a bit then in a Neil Young voice he sang look at the stars . Martin went on to further explain that the word yellow has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change yellow to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word yellow just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just to move on to the next question. Martin applauded Stern saying I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'. The band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was acquainted with the band's music through the former's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay, and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live. Yellow was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio, basically a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. The track was later mixed in New York City. Nelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song. According to Champion, ... it was really difficult to record because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging... The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove . To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle. Nelson used an analogue 2 inch type tape in recording most of the tracks on the album. As the recording progressed, Yellow was one of a couple of songs that they couldn't quite get on analogue . They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools to get the feel of just right once all takes were recorded into the computer, we then put it down to the 2 inch, which I found was a great way to do it , according to Nelson. Martin has explained, 'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and devotion. The references in some of the lyrics, including swimming and drawing a line, are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion . The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists, and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion, referring to his unrequited love for someone or something. Despite its lyrical theme, many fans have considered Yellow to be an upbeat track, although it is often interpreted as melancholy as well. The song is written in the key of B major with a tempo of 88 beats per minute. Yellow and Shiver were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000 along with the songs Help Is Round the Corner and No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground , the third taken from the band's first EP, Safety. In the United States, the song was released as the lead single from the album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets. The band released a limited edition CD of Trouble , the third single from Parachutes, which features a remix of Yellow . It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists. The single, accompanied by its TV reception through its music video, received massive radio airplay, particularly at BBC Radio 1. The reaction was chiefly positive and even the newly revitalised BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly. This heavy rotation continued for months after its release, eventually ending as 2000's most aired song. A month after the album was released in the United States via record label Nettwerk, Yellow was used as the theme song for ABC autumn television promotions. The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia's Daffodil Day , in recognition of that organisation's official flower's yellow hue. The song was well received by music critics. Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone Magazine has noted Yellow is unrepentantly romantic , adding that the band creates a hypnotic slo mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme . Yellow won Best Single at the 2001 NME Carling Awards. It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Billboard said that every time that electric guitar riff barges in, you're hooked all over again. In August 2009 the song was listed at 263 on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 songs of the 2000s . In October 2011, NME placed it at number 139 on its list 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years . Yellow played well in Europe, and was popular. In the United Kingdom, its midweek sales suggested that the single would reach the Top 10 of the chart. Although the band supposed Yellow would decline inside the Top 20, they would have considered its performance a triumph since the album's lead single, Shiver , had only reached the 35th position. Since Yellow 's second week sales were stronger, it eventually reached number four, giving the band their first Top 10 single in the United Kingdom. The popularity of the song in British clubs, pubs and sporting events bolstered the album to debut at number one on the UK Albums Chart. As of February 2015, the song has sold 530,000 copies in the UK. Yellow achieved popularity in the United States, and was Coldplay's first American hit. The single charted on eight different Billboard singles charts it also topped various US modern rock radio playlists in the spring of 2001. The single performed as it did in Europe and has helped Parachutes be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America during the single's stay on the chart. As of October 2014, the song has sold over 2 million copies in the US. After Coldplay's appearance at Sound Relief in Australia, In the charting week starting 22 March 2009, the single made a return to the Australian ARIA Top 50, after almost eight years since its last appearance in the Top 50. It re entered the chart at number 48. The music video for Yellow was filmed at Studland Bay in the county of Dorset, South West England. The video is minimalistic, featuring only Martin singing the song as he walks along the beach. He is seen wearing a set of waterproofs with his hair wet, suggesting that it had just rained. The video is one continuous shot with no cuts. The entire sequence is in slow motion. Originally, it had been intended for the whole band to appear in the video. Champion's mother's funeral was held on the day of the shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part. The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving stars in the sky, as if in a time lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin. The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point. The video was directed by British directing duo James Frost Alex Smith of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted from a monochromatic, grainy look at the start, to a warm, colourful and bright look at the end of the video. The look was inspired by the night swimming scenes in the movie Jaws. Coldplay have performed the song throughout their career, and it is a firm audience favourite. The song had its debut performance on television on the show Later...with Jools Holland. They performed Parachutes's lead single, Shiver , and the new song, Yellow but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact. They have also performed it at the Glastonbury Festival, one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed Yellow and effortlessly captured over 10,000 spectators. Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and Yellow has helped cultivate it Martin has said it was the best day of their year. During most concert performances, large yellow balloons are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in the air with a surprised look. In more recent years, January 2013 the balloons are filled with confetti, and at the end of the song Chris Martin would pop one with his guitar causing confetti to fly everywhere. A live acoustic version performed on Jo Whiley's The Lunchtime Social was included on the Acoustic EP. Another live version featuring only piano and vocals performed and broadcast in Los Angeles on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic was included on the Japanese Clocks EP. Most recently an acoustic piano version the song was recorded in the studio for Starbucks charity compilation album Every Mother Counts 2012. Coldplay performed the song at the Celebrating Steve event at the Apple campus on 16 October 2011. Before the performance, Martin revealed that, when they first played it for Steve Jobs 10 years ago, Jobs said the song was shit and that they would never make it . The song was later performed on 7 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany with guest vocals from Shakira. Yellow has been covered by many musicians, some in different languages and styles. Among the most notable is a Chinese language cover used as the last song in the 2018 movie, Crazy Rich Asians. Warner Bros. and Coldplay were initially both opposed to using the song, but Director Jon M. Chu convinced them otherwise, adding that a white director couldn't do it, but he could. Coldplay was convinced after Chu wrote a moving letter to the band. Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone Magazine deemed the song a career making record. Martin Roach claimed in his book, Coldplay Nobody Said It Was Easy, that although Shiver earned the band their debut UK Top 40 single, it was Yellow that has changed everything , and that it exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular . In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001. According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, for Spin magazine, the band is still known in the United States for their surprise smash 'Yellow' . A Billboard magazine review said, After one single 'Yellow' and its accompanying album Parachutes ... , Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit rock throne. The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album. The song was featured in Richard Linklater's film Boyhood. shipments figures based on certification alonesales streaming figures based on certification alone Citations Sources",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow%20%28Coldplay%20song%29
"Yellow Flicker Beat is a song by New Zealand singer Lorde released on 29 September 2014 as the lead single from the soundtrack for The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 by Republic Records. Written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Little and Paul Epworth, it is as an art pop and electropop song with an electronic production and minimal synthesisers and rattling drums in its instrumentation. Critics compared its style to that of Lorde's earlier releases such as her song Biting Down from The Love Club EP 2013 and Team 2013 from the singer's debut studio album Pure Heroine 2013 . The lyrics of the track refer to the rise of The Hunger Games' heroine Katniss Everdeen. Yellow Flicker Beat was well received by music critics, who praised its lyrical content for being more mature than that of Lorde's previous releases. Commercially, the song peaked at number 34 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the record charts of several nations, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. A music video for the song was directed by Emily Kai Bock and was released on 7 November 2014. Four days later, a remix of the song titled Flicker Kanye West Rework co produced by Lorde and Kanye West was released. Lorde performed the original version at the 2014 American Music Awards on 23 November 2014. The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and Best Song at the 20th Critics' Choice Awards. Yellow Flicker Beat lasts for a duration of 3 52 three minutes and fifty two seconds . The Sydney Morning Herald's reviewer Bernard Zuel characterised it as an electropop song and noted the electronic production on the song. Meanwhile, Billboard's Jason Lipshutz shared that the track explored Lorde's art pop sensibilities. The song features Lorde's brooding croon over minimal synthesisers and rattling drums. Alex Young and Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound labelled the song a throwback to Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine 2013 . Brennan Carley from Spin compared the style of Yellow Flicker Beat to that of Pure Heroine for the typically sweeping themes and moody, electronically enhanced melodies. He eventually drew comparisons between the track and Biting Down from The Love Club EP while Lipshutz compared the hook to her song Team 2013 . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony ATV Music Publishing, it is set in a tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor originally recorded six steps lower in G sharp Minor , and follows the chord progression AmDmAmE. Lorde's vocals range from E3 to E5. The lyrics of Yellow Flicker Beat reference the rise of The Hunger Games' heroine Katniss Everdeen. The song begins with a slow and measured start, which features the touched by pain lyrics I'm a princess cut from marble smoother than a storm. As the drums start, Lorde sings This is the start. Zuelit opined that the line was also the beginning of the end of something. Not their innocence, already sacrificed for a higher goal, but definitely any easy comfort. Carley pointed out that the lines The scars that mark my body They're silver and gold and My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones showcased a big step towards more mature lyrics. On 31 July 2014, it was announced that Lorde would be the curator for the soundtrack of The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 2014 . On 23 September 2014, Lorde announced that the song, titled Yellow Flicker Beat , would be released on 29 September 2014. The song was written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Paul Epworth. Yellow Flicker Beat was recorded at the Lakehouse Recording Studios in New Jersey on 28 and 29 August 2014. The song was engineered by Matt Wiggins and Erik Kase Romero. On 29 September 2014, Yellow Flicker Beat was released digitally on the iTunes Stores worldwide by Republic Records. The same day, it was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio and US adult album alternative AAA and modern rock stations. Yellow Flicker Beat received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Writing for Spin, Carley praised the metaphorical and mature lyrics of Yellow Flicker Beat . Meanwhile, Reed complimented on the song's production, writing that the song fits comfortably within the 17 year old's sonic wheelhouse. On behalf of The Sydney Morning Herald, Zuel labelled the track another smart musical, as much as career, step by Lorde . Billboard's Steven J. Horowitz opined that Lorde's voice complemented the song's beat well, and rated it three and a half out of five stars. The single was ranked at number four on Cosmopolitan's year end list. Yellow Flicker Beat was nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and Best Song at the 20th Critics' Choice Awards. Despite its praise, several critics noted its conventional sound. Chris Schulz of The New Zealand Herald wrote that Yellow Flicker Beat sounded too similar to Lorde's previous work, and lamented the lack of a catchy hook and chorus. Echoing Schulz' statements, Lydia Jenkin, also from the Herald, pointed out that while its sound was reminiscent of the singer's early works, it was still a perfect musical depiction of Katniss Everdeen . In the United States, Yellow Flicker Beat debuted at number 17 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs chart. In doing so, Lorde logged the highest launch by a female artist on the chart since 1995 when Juliana Hatfield's Universal Heart Beat also debuted at number seventeen. Additionally, the single appeared on the Adult Alternative Songs at number 19 with 5.2 million radio audience impressions in first week audience. On the Billboard Hot 100, the single peaked at number 34. Yellow Flicker Beat also charted moderately on several national record charts, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The single was a success in New Zealand, peaking at number four on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was certified gold by the Recorded Music NZ and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA . The song was ranked the 18th greatest song of 2014 by Australian alternative music station Triple J. The music video for Yellow Flicker Beat was directed by Emily Kai Bock, and was released on 7 November 2014 at midnight NZDT , when Lorde turned eighteen years old. It has been described as first person narrative from a woman expressing the strength and resolve of Katniss Everdeen, the central character of The Hunger Games franchise. Commenting on the concept of the video, Lorde wrote on her Tumblr page that she wanted to convey a mood a harsh, crackling heat. She refers to Katniss as someone pushed over the edge and considers her a shapeshifter, full of intensity and impulse. The singer stated that whether Katniss is in small space or a cavernous one, shes fiery. Lorde revealed that she broke her foot when filming the scene where she fell towards the camera. The video starts with Lorde singing in a faintly lit motel room, with a television displaying static and a running car facing the window. The singer is dressed in a white button down shirt, black slacks and her hair done up in a pompadour. Afterwards, the clip showcases Lorde looking away from the camera in a room surrounded with potted plants. The camera moves away towards a dark, abandoned road filled by smoke with only one street light beaming on the singer. As the chorus begins, a group of teenagers form a circle as they point a flashlight at Lorde as she dances. Her dancing was described as twitchy and witchy . In the next scene, the singer sits alone on the edge of a dark lit public swimming pool. She then arrives at 1920s inspired cocktail party where she falls into a bottomless pit which was described as a surreal cliff . She appears dancing besides a white curtain concluding the video wearing a white suit as she sits in a bus stop bench. The frequent white colored fashion choices was compared by critics to Peeta's look during his video announcements in the Capitol. Critics compared the singer's fashion and dancing to that of Prince and Robyn. Billboard's Zach Dionne complimented the fashion choice on the video, calling it awesome . Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone opined that the music video had little to do with The Hunger Games' concept however, it did capture the alienation and defiance that fuels Katniss. Likewise, Andrew Untergerger from Spin wrote that the clip was disappointing there's no actual Hunger Games footage in there , yet complimented its overall production and called it cinematic. On behalf of MTV, Abby Devora wrote that Lorde is ... truly coming into her own and named it a welcome change from Lorde's previous videos. Slant wrote that despite looking awkward and slightly unhinged during public appearances , her performance in the visual was described with elegance and sophistication. The scene where Lorde and other guests smile toward a camera at a cocktail party was compared to the ending of the 1980 horror film The Shining. On 2 October 2014, Lorde performed Yellow Flicker Beat for the first time at Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California. Later that month, she gave a live rendition of the track at the ACL Music Festival. The overall performance was praised. Lorde performed the song at the 2014 American Music Awards on 23 November 2014. She began the performance by singing inside of an orange lit box . Halfway through the song, the box lifted, exposing Lorde in a white crop top and black pants outfit to the audience and was accompanied with a group of white clad dancers. She ended by smearing her lipstick on stage. The performance was highly praised, particularly Lorde's stage presence and was considered one of the night's best by several publications. Billboard described the performance as an honest, impeccable portrayal of Lordes most idiosyncratic qualities. , referring to it as scary good . The publication later ranked it the second best performance of the night, behind Taylor Swift's Blank Space 2014 stating that Lorde proved to be the coolest weird dancer in the pop world. Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly gave the performance an A, expressing that despite being the show's most awkward moment, Lorde delivered a dose of bracing weirdness. Rolling Stone compared her thrashing and headbanging to Nine Inch Nails' March of the Pigs 1994 video. The publication also praised the singer's exquisitely intimate and intense moments inside the box she performed in. Lorde and Kanye West produced a version of the song titled Flicker Kanye West Rework , which was also included on the Mockingjay Part 1 soundtrack album, at a Malibu, California studio. The track was made available for purchase on 11 November 2014 as one of the pre order tracks from the soundtrack. Talking about the collaboration with West, Lorde commented, He's so private I feel weird talking about how he does stuff. I feel lucky to even be in a room with him. The track incorporates stripped down production, creepy textural synthesisers and booming, echo laden beats and does not feature West's vocals. According to a number of critics, the production on it was reminiscent of West's album Yeezus 2013 . Rolling Stone stated that the rework made ample use of ethereal synths and backing vocals, while the haunting piano line at the end perfectly contrasted from the track's original heavy, clanking percussion. The Independent called it understated and beautiful. Stereogum writer James Rettig shared similar stating that the rework was a subtle adjustment of the track that makes it a bit more grandiose and ominous. Emilee Lindner from MTV News deemed the rework as creepy in an epic way. Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Hunger Games Mockingjay, Part 1 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Tidal.

The Yellow Line runs from Huntington in Virginia to Greenbelt station during all times since May 2019. Before then, it used to short turns at Mount Vernon Square during peak hours and ended at Fort Totten station during off peak hours. Due to platform reconstruction, all Yellow and Blue line services terminated at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from May 22, 2019 to September 8, 2019. The line shares tracks with the Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza northward to Greenbelt. It is a quick link between downtown Washington and National Airport, and shares nearly all of its track with either the Green or Blue Line. The Yellow Line has only two stations that are not shared by any other lines Eisenhower Avenue and Huntington , and only two sections of track that are not shared by any other lines the section at the south end of the line, and the section between the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza stations, crossing the Potomac River. Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of the region projected for 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a regional transportation agency with a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. The new agency, the National Capital Transportation Administration, issued a 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report, which did not include the route that became the Yellow Line. A central route under 7th Street in downtown was only added in 1967 primarily to serve the inner city . In March 1968, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority WMATA board approved its 98 mile 158 km Adopted Regional System ARS which included the Yellow Line from Franconia and Backlick Road in Springfield to Greenbelt. While a cut and fill tunnel for Yellow Line was built under 7th Street and U Street, both street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets were difficult. The result was the loss of the traditional retail businesses along the route. The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977. Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince Georges' County of the exact alignment of the Yellow Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, the ARS called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned North Central Freeway, but after that road was cancelled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays. Service on the Yellow Line began on April 30, 1983, adding Archives to the system and linking the two already built stations of Gallery Place and Pentagon with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond National Airport by four stations to Huntington on December 17, 1983, the first station outside the Capital Beltway. When the Green Line link to U Street opened on May 11, 1991, it acted as an extension of the Yellow Line until the southern Green Line branch was completed. When Green Line service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at Mount Vernon Square, where a pocket track exists to relay trains. The Yellow Line was originally planned to follow a slightly different route in Virginia. The plan would have sent Yellow Line trains to FranconiaSpringfield, with Blue Line trains serving Huntington. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars at the time of the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington due to the Yellow Line's shorter route the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Yellow Line operated to FranconiaSpringfield on July 4, as part of Metro's special service pattern on that day. In 1998, Congress changed the name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to implement the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change the name of the National Airport station which never included the full name of the airport . In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only at the request of the local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Finally, in 2001, Congress made changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding. In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. To accommodate these platform reconstructions, the Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport would be closed from May 25, to September 8, 2019, in what would be the longest line closure in Metro's history. In 2006, Metro board member Jim Graham and D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams proposed re extending Yellow Line service to Fort Totten station or even to Greenbelt station, which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line. Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban members of the board initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off peak hours. An 18 month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of 5.75 million to the District of Columbia. The pilot program was made a permanent service. Starting June 18, 2012, the Yellow Line was extended as part of the Rush program, to Greenbelt on the northern end and several trains were diverted to Franconia Springfield on the southern end. This was discontinued on June 25, 2017 in part of budget cuts. Yellow Line trains now stop at Mt Vernon Square during peak hours and Fort Totten station all other times. In 2019, Metro announced that Yellow Line trains will be re extend from Mt Vernon Sq Fort Totten back to Greenbelt during all times beginning May 25, 2019. The Southern terminus of the Yellow Line is adjacent to Kings Highway Virginia Route 241 in Fairfax County, Virginia. The line heads northeast on a bridge over Hunting Creek and the Washington Beltway Interstate 95 to a station just south of Eisenhower Avenue, which serves a number of government office buildings including the United States Patent Office. The Yellow Line then merges with the Blue Line and follows the right of way of the CSX Railroad through the City of Alexandria. The line enters a short tunnel under U.S. Route 1. After crossing a bridge over Four Mile Run, the line enters Arlington County on an elevated structure above the National Airport parking lots. At the north end of the airport, the Yellow Line enters a tunnel under 18th Street South and South Hayes Street in Crystal City. The tunnel continues along the southwest face of the Pentagon which is a two level station to facilitate a fork with the Blue Line. After the Pentagon station, the Yellow Line emerges from its tunnel east of the Pentagon and crosses the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge over the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Potomac River, and Ohio Drive. At the end of the bridge, the Yellow Line re enters a tunnel near the Jefferson Memorial and crosses under the Washington Channel. The tunnel merges with the Green Line tunnel under 7th Street Southwest just south of the L'Enfant Plaza. The joint Yellow Line Green Line tunnel continues north through downtown Washington under 7th Street, turns west under Florida Avenue and U Street, and then north under 14th Street Northwest. The tunnel then turns toward the northeast under Park Road and New Hampshire Avenue. The tunnel then bends eastward under Rock Creek Cemetery and Fort Totten Park to emerge just before entering the lower level of the Fort Totten station. Until May 2019, this was the northernmost terminal for Yellow Line service, with the track continuing northeast as just the Green Line to the Greenbelt terminus. Since then, the Yellow Line continues along these tracks to Greenbelt with the Green Line. The Yellow Line needs 10 six car trains 60 rail cars to run at peak capacity. Internally, the Yellow Line in Virginia was called the Huntington Route C and the route through the District of Columbia and beyond to Greenbelt as the Greenbelt Route E . The following stations are along the line, from south to north. On November 16, 1995, WMATA and the developer of the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria, Virginia, signed an agreement to construct a new station between Braddock Road and National Airport that will be financed by the developer. The Federal Transit Administration, in cooperation with WMATA, the National Park Service and The City of Alexandria government, completed an environmental impact statement for the project in June 2016. The station would be complete by 2021 or 2022. A second improvement project involves building a pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center with the western mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would reduce the number of passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remained unfunded. Route map",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow%20Line%20%28Washington%20Metro%29
"Yellow Star is a 2006 biographical children's novel by Jennifer Roy. Written in free verse, it depicts life through the eyes of a young Jewish girl whose family was forced into the odz Ghetto in 1939 during World War II. Roy tells the story of her aunt Syvia, who shared her childhood memories with Roy more than 50 years after the ghetto's liberation. Roy added fictionalized dialogue, but did not otherwise alter the story. The book covers Syvia's life as she grows from four and a half to ten years old in the ghetto. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and her younger cousin Isaac were three of only twelve children who survived. After the war, Syvia moved to the United States, married, and only much later told her story to Roy. Since its publication in 2006, the book has received multiple awards, starred reviews, and other accolades, and has been made into a likewise well received audiobook. Yellow Star is the outgrowth of Sylvia Perlmutter Rozines' recollections of life in the odz ghetto. Perlmutter Rozines, then Syvia Perlmutter, was a four and a half year old child when she and her relatives were confined to the ghetto in late 1939. The ghetto was liberated the day before she turned 10 more than half her life had been lived in the ghetto. The book relates the events of those five and a half years, as an adult Sylvia recalled them years later. The title derives from the yellow badge that Syvia was forced to wear. More than 50 years after the events described in the book, Perlmutter Rozines began telling her story to family members, starting with her son, Roy's cousin Greg, who told Roy's sister Julia, who told Roy. Roy tape recorded the conversations between herself and Perlmutter Rozines, and used those conversations as the basis for the book. Yellow Star is written in free verse, after Roy struggled with how to authentically express Perlmutter Rozines' experiences to children in a way that did not seem stiff or detached. Roy cites Karen Hesse's Newbery Medal winning Out of the Dust as an inspiration for the book's voice. Roy edited Perlmutter Rozines' various recollections together into chronological order, and penned narrative introductions to each chapter describing the war's events outside the ghetto. While the book is substantially based on Perlmutter Rozines' recollections, it is classified as historical fiction since Roy included fictionalized dialogue. In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland and forced that nation's second largest community of Jews, 270,000 strong, into one section of the city of odz, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in odz. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other odz area Jews, into a segregated section of the city a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings. When the other Jewish children were sent to Chelmno, Syvia's family smuggled the children from cellar to cellar. The book also relates tragic events one of Syvia's friends disappears, and another is killed and burned in an extermination camp. The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia's tenth birthday, on January 19, 1945. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and a younger cousin, Isaac, were three of only twelve children who survived. An extensive Author's Note details the fate of the people Syvia interacted with in the Ghetto, including how the survivors in her immediate family settled initially in Paris. Afterwards, she emigrated to the United States, Americanized her name, married David Rozines another Holocaust survivor , and settled in upstate New York as Sylvia Perlmutter Rozines. As of 2006, Sylvia, now widowed, had moved to Maryland, and volunteers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. She gave a videotaped interview to the Shoah Foundation, which records the personal recollections of Holocaust survivors. Yellow Star received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly and Booklist. The Publishers Weekly review commended the book for the lyricism of the narrative, and Syvia's credible childlike voice, maturing with each chapter, as she gains further understanding of the events around her . Another reviewer praised the format, saying the free verse format suits the young narrator and subject matter well and concluding that Readers searching for an accessible Holocaust novel will be absorbed by this haunting story based on true events . Library Media Connection's review praises Roy for her age appropriate language When Syvia witnesses the shooting of people in the street, author Jennifer Roy captures the fear of the moment without graphic descriptions . Yellow Star was selected as a fiction and poetry honor book in the 2006 Boston Globe Horn Book Awards, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book for Older Readers in April 2007, and won the 2009 William Allen White Children's Book Award, selected by vote of sixth through eighth graders in Kansas. Yellow Star was made into an audiobook read by Christina Moore in 2007. A Booklist review noted that Moore's 'vroom sput sput pop' to mirror Nazi motorcycles, booming bomb sounds, and transition to a scratchy voice to reflect the youngster's oncoming sickness more than make up for a few technical glitches, including evidence of page turning and distracting breathing sounds.

"Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 17 January 1969 in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released Yellow Submarine and All You Need Is Love . The remainder of the album is a re recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some songs were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before and issued two months after the band's self titled double LP also known as the White Album and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered for release, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters. Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed . The album arose from contractual obligations for the Beatles to supply new songs to the soundtrack to United Artists' animated film Yellow Submarine. Having recently completed their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967, the group showed minimal enthusiasm for the project. Along with the music for their Magical Mystery Tour TV film, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack was part of a period that author Ian MacDonald later described as the band's regime of continuous low intensity recording ... it had a workaday quality about it an intrinsic lack of tension which was bound to colour the resulting material. Al Brodax, producer of the Yellow Submarine film Only one side of the album contains songs performed by the Beatles of the six, four were previously unreleased. Yellow Submarine had been issued in August 1966 as a single, topping the UK chart for four weeks, and had also been released on the album Revolver. Following the Beatles' performance of the song on the Our World international television broadcast, All You Need Is Love had also been issued as a single, in July 1967. A stereo mix was made of this song on 29 October 1968 for release on this album. Of the unreleased tracks, the first to be recorded was George Harrison's Only a Northern Song , taped in February 1967 but rejected for inclusion on Sgt. Pepper. The group performed overdubs on this basic track in April, immediately after completing the stereo mixes for that album. Among the sounds added during what Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn describes as a curious session , were trumpet, glockenspiel and spoken voices. Harrison's lyrics reflect his displeasure at being merely a contracted songwriter to the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. All Together Now was recorded in a single session on 12 May 1967, specifically for the film project. The title came from a phrase Paul McCartney had heard as a child, to encourage everyone to sing music hall songs. He later described the song as a throwaway . The band recorded Harrison's It's All Too Much in late May 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios in central London. Inspired by its author's experimentation with the drug LSD, and originally running to over eight minutes in length, the song reflects the Summer of Love philosophy of 1967 and makes extensive use of guitar feedback. As with the later recorded All You Need Is Love , the track includes musical and lyrical quotations from other works in this case, a trumpet passage from Jeremiah Clarke's Prince of Denmark's March and a lyric from the Merseys' 1966 hit Sorrow . John Lennon's Hey Bulldog was recorded on 11 February 1968 and evolved from an initial intent to shoot a promotional film for the single Lady Madonna . Like All Together Now , it was specifically recorded with the film soundtrack in mind. The track's ending featured a jam session after the point where a fade out was intended in the final mix, which was kept in the finished version. Lennon later described the song as a good sounding record that means nothing . Side two features a re recording of the symphonic film score composed by the Beatles' producer, George Martin, specifically for the album. The recording took place with a 41 piece orchestra over two three hour sessions on 22 and 23 October 1968 in Abbey Road, and was edited down to the length on the LP on 22 November. In some of his arrangements, Martin referenced his past work with the Beatles for example, Sea of Time includes what MacDonald terms an affectionate quotation from the Indian styled Within You Without You , from Sgt. Pepper, and Yellow Submarine in Pepperland reprises the film's title track. In Sea of Monsters , Martin included the beginning of Bach's Air on the G String, while in other selections he parodies works by Stravinsky. MacDonald also detects the influence of Mozart and Webern among the classical allusions in Martin's score. The film received its worldwide premiere in London in July 1968, by which time the Beatles were busy working on their self titled double album, commonly called the White Album . After viewing the finished film, the Beatles were much more enthusiastic and did more to associate themselves with it after its release. Having been delayed so that it would not clash with the release of The Beatles, and to allow for the re recording of Martin's contributions, Yellow Submarine was issued by Apple Records on 13 January 1969 in the US and on 17 January in the UK. The album was issued in stereo only in the US, while the UK album was available in both stereo and mono, although the mono version is simply a fold down a combination of two stereo channels into one mono rather than a specific mix. Since All You Need Is Love had been rush released as a single, it did not have an official stereo mix. Although the track was released on the US LP Magical Mystery Tour, an official stereo mix of the track was not made until 29 October 1968 for the album. In the US, 8 track tape and cassette tape versions featured Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds , which was also heard in the film, as an additional song. In contrast to the animated film, Yellow Submarine was not generally considered to be a significant release. Issued two months after The Beatles, it was one of the few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States, peaking instead at number 3 and number 2, respectively. In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12 week run at number 1. On America's Billboard Top LPs chart, it was kept from the top by the same album. The artwork on the sleeve contains a drawing of the Beatles as featured on trailer posters, created by Heinz Edelman. The same basic design was used for the UK and US covers, though the UK jacket contains the words Nothing is Real taken from Strawberry Fields Forever just below the album's title, while the US version did not. On the back of the cover, the UK album contained a review of the White Album written for The Observer by Tony Palmer. The review was introduced by a few liner notes by Apple press officer Derek Taylor. The US cover contained a fictitious illustrated biography by Dan Davis of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles in the history of the English speaking world Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence. An EP containing the new songs had been considered for release in September 1968, but any plan to issue the soundtrack music from Yellow Submarine was then postponed to allow for the White Album's unveiling. Following the delayed release of the soundtrack album, however, Lewisohn writes that the Beatles were mildly criticised for issuing a new LP with just four new songs and having ceded a full LP side to Martin's music and thereby failing to provide their customary excellent value for money . As a result, the band decided to reissue Yellow Submarine as a five track mono EP, without the film score but including the then unreleased Across the Universe as a bonus track. This EP was mastered in March 1969 but was never issued. The original running order for the EP was Only a Northern Song , Hey Bulldog and Across the Universe on side one, with All Together Now and It's All Too Much on side two. Lennon later dismissed Martin's contributions as all this terrible shit and blamed Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, for allowing Martin to participate in the project. According to author and music journalist Peter Doggett, neither the proposed EP format nor an expanded soundtrack album containing other previously issued Beatles songs that appear in the 1968 film was possible at the time, since both options would have denied George Martin his contractual right to appear alongside The Beatles and robbed him of potentially the largest royalty payment of his career. The first compact disc release of the album appeared in August 1987. It was consistent with the British version of the LP, with Sea of Time and Sea of Holes as separate tracks the Nothing Is Real subtitle remained, and the review of the White Album with Taylor's introduction was reproduced inside the CD insert. The soundtrack album returned to the UK charts, peaking at number 60. A new Yellow Submarine album appeared on 13 September 1999, coinciding with the remastered re release of the film. Titled Yellow Submarine Songtrack, it dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all completely remixed for this disc. The original album remained available and was remastered and reissued, along with the rest of the Beatles' catalogue, on 9 September 2009. This release included both the UK and US sleeve notes. The mono mixes of the four songs that were intended for the unreleased EP along with Across the Universe were released for the first time on the Mono Masters collection as part of the box set The Beatles in Mono. Recalling the album's release in a special edition issue of Mojo magazine, Peter Doggett writes that The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine . Beat Instrumental bemoaned the paucity of new material by the band, but added be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film is really very nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track. In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score superbly produced and, of the songs, wrote only of It's All Too Much , which he described as, variously, Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling and Happy singalong music . Record Mirror's reviewer said that, given the longstanding demand for a soundtrack album, the release of Yellow Submarine would evoke the ecstasy of fans the world over . The reviewer added that the four new Beatles songs matched the quality of the two excellent hit singles, and Martin's side represented a tremendous achievement that also justified any complaints about the price. Writing in their 1975 book The Beatles An Illustrated Record, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations that had resulted in the release of a full soundtrack album, saying that the four new tracks would have made a superb EP . More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger has written of Yellow Submarine The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four song EP ... with the addition of a bonus track in Across the Universe ... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye or ear there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good. Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered and describes Hey Bulldog as a tough and funky piano driven rocker, by a good margin the best song here . Richardson concludes But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise. PopMatters' David Gassman views Martin's selections as kind of twee and inconsequential and the four new songs on side one as fascinating , adding that The material's tossed off origins give it a character unlike any other Beatles album. While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the 1999 release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Gassman writes No matter how you get them, though, the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought to be part of any thinking Beatles fan's collection. Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes as a whole, Yellow Submarine is a delightful album, even if it's still a less than acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon , though he criticised the inclusion of Martin's score, which he felt should have been sold as a separate release. All tracks are written by LennonMcCartney, except Only a Northern Song and It's All Too Much , by George Harrison. All tracks are written by George Martin, except Yellow Submarine in Pepperland , by LennonMcCartney, arr. Martin.

"The yellow lipped sea krait Laticauda colubrina , also known as the banded sea krait, colubrine sea krait, is a species of venomous sea snake found in tropical Indo Pacific oceanic waters. The snake has distinctive black stripes and a yellow snout, with a paddle like tail for use in swimming. It spends much of its time underwater in order for it to hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack when feeling threatened. The head of a banded sea krait is black, with lateral nostrils and an undivided rostral scale. The upper lip and snout are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends backward on each side of the head above the eye to the temporal scales. The body of the snake is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is typically a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to more than half of the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate overlapping dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle shaped and adapted to swimming. On average, the total length of a male is 875 mm 34.4 in long, with a 130 mm 5.1 in long tail. Females are significantly larger, with an average total length of 1,420 mm 56 in and a tail length of 145 mm 5.7 in . The yellow lipped sea krait is widespread throughout the eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. It can be found from the eastern coast of India, along the coast of the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh, Myanmar and other parts of Southeast Asia, to the Malay Archipelago and to some parts of southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The species is also common on Fiji and other Pacific islands within its range. Vagrant individuals have been recorded in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. The venom of this elapid, Laticauda colubrina, is a very powerful neurotoxic protein, with a subcutaneous LD50 in mice of 0.45 mg kg body weight. The venom is an neurotoxin that disrupts synapses by competing with acetylcholine for receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, similar to erabutoxins and bungarotoxins. In mice, lethal venom doses cause lethargy, flaccid paralysis, and convulsions in quick succession before death. Dogs injected with lethal doses produced symptoms consistent with fatal hypertension and cyanosis observed in human sea snake bite victims. Some varieties of eels, which are a primary food source for banded sea kraits, may have coevolved resistance to banded sea krait venom. Gymnothorax moray eels taken from the Caribbean, where the banded sea krait is not present, died after injection with doses as small as 0.1 mg kg body weight, but Gymnothorax individuals taken from New Guinea, where banded sea kraits are endemic, were able to tolerate doses as large as 75 mg kg without severe injury. Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay in water and on adjacent coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females. Body adaptations, especially a paddle like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations are also found in more distantly related sea snakes Hydrophiinae because of convergent evolution. However, because of the differences in motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land. When hunting, banded sea kraits frequently head into deep water far from land, but return to land in order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. One study found that when banded sea kraits on Fijian islands were relocated to different islands 5.3 km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days. Banded sea kraits collected near the tip of Borneo had heavy tick infections. Hunting is often performed alone, but L. colubrina may also do so in large numbers in the company of hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique is similar to that of the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey. While probing crevices with their head, banded sea kraits are unable to observe approaching predators and can be vulnerable. The snakes can deter predators, such as larger fish, sharks, and birds, by fooling them into thinking that their tail is their head, because the color and movement of the tail is similar to that of the snake's head. For example, the lateral aspect of the tail corresponds to the dorsal view of the head. Banded sea kraits primarily feed on varieties of eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt for only one prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey. The banded sea krait is oviparous, meaning it lays eggs that develop outside of the body. Each year during the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring. When a male detects a female, it chases the female and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies with the female and rhythmically contract the resulting mass of snakes can remain nearly motionless for several days. After courtship, the snakes copulate for about an average of two hours. The female banded sea kraits then lay as many as 10 eggs per clutch. The eggs are deposited in crevices where they remain until hatching. These eggs are very rarely found in the wild only two nests have been definitively reported throughout the entire range of the species. Because banded sea kraits spend much of their time on land, they are often encountered by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts. There are fewer recorded bites from this species compared to other venomous species such as cobras and vipers as it is less aggressive and tends to avoid humans. If they do bite, it is usually in self defense when accidentally grabbed. Most sea snake bites occur when fishermen attempt to untangle the snakes from their fishing nets. In the Philippines, banded sea kraits are caught for their skin and meat the meat is smoked and exported for use in Japanese cuisine. The smoked meat of a related Laticauda species, the black banded sea krait, is used in Okinawan cuisine to make irabu jiru Japanese , irabu soup .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-lipped%20sea%20krait
"Yelp is a business directory service and crowd sourced review forum, and a public company of the same name that is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company develops, hosts and markets the Yelp.com website and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd sourced reviews about businesses. It also operates an online reservation service called Yelp Reservations. The company has been accused of using unfair practices to raise revenue from the businesses that are reviewed on its site e.g., by presenting more negative review information for companies that do not purchase its advertising services or by prominently featuring advertisements of the competitors of such non paying companies. The company has acknowledged these practices to some degree, while denying certain behavior. The company's review system's reliability has also been affected by the submission of fake reviews by external users, such as false positive reviews submitted by a company to promote its own business or false negative reviews submitted about competing businesses a practice sometimes known as astroturfing , which the company has tried to combat in various ways. Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew in usage and raised several rounds of funding in the following years. By 2010 it had 30 million in revenue, and the website had published about 4.5 million crowd sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009, it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. As of the second quarter of 2019, Yelp reported having a monthly average of 61.8 million unique visitors via desktop computer and 76.7 million unique visitors via its mobile website. As of June 30 2019, Yelp stated on their Investor Relations page that it had 192 million reviews on its site. Major competitors in the United States for the company's review service include TripAdvisor, Foursquare, and user reviews on Google Maps. A service offered by dianping.com in China is also similar, although Yelp does not operate in China. Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004. Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor. The co founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided 1 million in initial funding. MRL co founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name Yelp . In an interview published in February 2013, Stoppelman explained why they decided on Yelp for the company's name, stating that it was short, memorable, easy to spell, and was familiar with 'the help' and 'yellow pages' . According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email based system was convoluted . The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family. Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the Real Reviews feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the site's popularity soared after it was re designed in late 2005. Yelp raised 5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and 10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital. The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006. By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors. It raised 15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008. In 2010, Elevation Partners invested 100 million 75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while 25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion. Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews. By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be 30 million and it employed 300 people. Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009 and one for Canada that August. The first non English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010 users had the option to read and write content in French or English. From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period. An Australian website went live in November 2011. It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings, and was initially glitchy. Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey and Denmark. Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore, which was followed by Japan in 2014. In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company, but the two parties failed to reach an agreement. According to The New York Times, Google offered about 500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered 1 billion. Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers. In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services. Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation. That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites. Having filed for an initial public offering IPO with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011, Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of 15, the company was valued at 898 million. In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for 50 million. The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to 1. Yelp acquired the start up online reservation company SeatMe for 12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013. Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of 55 million exceeded expectations , but the company was not yet profitable. In 2012 13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying about 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery the former PacBell building in San Francisco. The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm. It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility. Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina. Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German based restaurant review site Restaurant Kritik and French based CityVox. In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food ordering service, for 134 million. Then in August 2017, Yelp sold Eat24 to Grubhub for 287.5 million. The acquisition resulted in a partnership to integrate Grubhub delivery into the Yelp profiles of restaurants. In late 2015, a Public Services Government section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages. For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages. Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections. Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant related food poisoning outbreaks. On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30 international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce. In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for 20 million. In May, 2017 Yelp's stocks dropped by 30 following disappointing sales. Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd sourced local business review and social networking site. Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas. The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services using a one to five star rating system. Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals. In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives. According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is one of the most important sites on the Internet. As of Q4 2017 it has 141 million monthly unique visitors and 148 million reviews. 78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better, but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Users can give a thumbs up to reviews they like, which causes these reviews to be featured more prominently in the system. Each day a Review of the Day is determined based on a vote by users. As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device. The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008. In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera. Check in features were added in 2010. Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010. Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable, but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015. SeatMe was reworked into the current Yelp Reservations feature. In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores and make appointments at spas. Yelp's content was integrated into Apple's Siri virtual assistant and the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of the iOS 6 computer operating system. Yelp also has features for businesses to offer special deals to Yelp users. In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf games, and legal consultations, among other things. In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp. Yelp started a 710 cash back program at some US restaurants in 2016 through partnership with Empyr. On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched Yelp Questions and Answers, a feature for users to ask venue specific questions about businesses. Users can upvote and downvote the answers that have been provided to the questions. Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008. Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to resolve their complaints. In some other cases, disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations. The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs. A business owner can claim a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports. Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using a Yelp check in feature. In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device. Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines. Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses. Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors. As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30 year over year. Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three star rating to sign up for advertising. Originally a sponsored favorite review could place a positive review above negative ones, but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter the valid criticism that advertisers were able to obtain a more positive review appearance in exchange for pay. A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each star in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 59 percent. A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours. A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer. According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses. Criticism of Yelp continues to focus on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers. As Yelp became more influential, the phenomenon of business owners and competitors writing fake reviews, known as astroturfing , became more prevalent. A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6 of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20 in 2014. Yelp's own review filter identifies 25 of reviews as suspicious. Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use. The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their first obviously fake reviews . Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star rating. The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has the most aggressive astroturfing filter out of the crowd sourced websites it looked into. Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works, which it says would reveal information on how to defeat it. Yelp also conducts sting operations to uncover businesses writing their own reviews. In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90 day consumer alert on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read We caught someone red handed trying to buy reviews for this business . In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay. In 2013, Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his legal disputes and activism against Yelp. An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014. In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations. In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over 34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress. According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has always had a complicated relationship with small businesses . Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs. Many business owners have said that Yelp salespeople have offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising. Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried, and then soon afterwards, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising. Yelp staff acknowledged that they had allowed their advertising partners to move their favorite review to the top of the listings as a featured review , but said the reviews were not otherwise manipulated to favor the partner businesses. Such featured reviews were shown with a strip above them that said One of 's Favorite Reviews and This business is a Yelp sponsor. The company also said it might have had some rogue salespeople that misrepresented their practices when selling advertising services. In response to the criticism of their allowing their advertising partners to manipulate the review listing, Yelp ceased its featured review practice in 2010. Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay 300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion. In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustration with seeing Yelp remove positive reviews after they declined to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company. Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature. In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices. In 2018, in the case Hassell v. Bird, the California Supreme Court held by a narrow 4 3 margin that a business cannot force Yelp to remove a review, even if the review is defamatory of the business. A 2019 investigation by Vice News and the podcast Underunderstood found that in some cases, Yelp was replacing restaurant's direct phone numbers with numbers that routed through GrubHub, which would then charge restaurants for the calls under marketing agreements GrubHub has with restaurants. Some users have posted reviews that contained comments about the political activities and political views of businesses and their owners or have submitted ratings affected by political motivations. In some instances, the Yelp review area for a business has become flooded with thousands and thousands of such review submissions after a business was involved in some politically sensitive action. Yelp has removed reviews of this nature and has tried to suppress their submission. Amy McKeever of Eater wrote, As a social media platform based on free speech, the company had to decide whether to allow political expression on its pages or protect businesses and its own business model. Yelp chose the latter. Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews. In 2012, the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet cleaning business in 2014, Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws. In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using disparagement clauses in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online. According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers sometimes called Yelpers are well intentioned and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or to be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike. Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location, or by praise and attention from other users. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Users can give a review a thumbs up rating, which will cause it to be ranked higher in the review listings. Each day a Review of the Day is determined based on a vote by users. According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet savvy adults aged 1825 or suburban baby boomers . Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos. Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self nominated to the Yelp Elite Squad and some are accepted based on an evaluation of the quality and frequency of their reviews. Members may nominate other reviewers for elite status. Users must use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad. To accept a nomination, members must not own a business. Elite Squad Yelpers are governed by a council and estimated to include several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected. Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member. The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005, and in 2006 it was formally codified the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the Yelp Elite Squad . Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks. As of 2017, there are over 80 local Elite Squads in North America. As of 2017, Yelp employed a staff of over 80 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners. Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp
"Yemen sent a delegation to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia from 15 September to 1 October 2000.

"Yeovil jovl YOH vl is a town and civil parish in the district of South Somerset, England, with a population of 45,000. Yeovil is close to Somerset's southern border with Dorset, 130 miles 210 km from London, 40 miles 64 km south of Bristol, 6 miles 9.7 km from Sherborne and 30 miles 48 km from Taunton. The aircraft and defence industries developed in the 20th century made it a target for bombing in the Second World War. They are still major employers. Yeovil Country Park, which includes Ninesprings, is one of several open spaces with educational, cultural and sporting facilities. Religious sites include the 14th century Church of St John the Baptist. The town is on the A30 and A37 roads and has two railway stations. Archaeological surveys of the town have yielded Palaeolithic burial and settlement sites mainly to the south of the modern town, particularly in Hendford, where a Bronze Age golden torc twisted collar was found. Yeovil is on the main Roman road from Dorchester to the Fosse Way at Ilchester. The route of the old road is aligned with the A37 from Dorchester, Hendford Hill, Rustywell, across the Westland site, to Larkhill Road and Vagg Lane, rejoining the A37 at the Halfway House pub in the Ilchester Road. The Westland site has evidence of a small Roman town. There were several Roman villas estates in the area. Finds have been made at East Coker, West Coker and Lufton. The name Yeovil was first mentioned in a Saxon charter dated 880 as Gifle. It derives from the Celtic river name gifl forked river , an earlier name of the River Yeo. The estate was bequeathed in the will of King Alfred the Great to his youngest son Aethelweard. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as Givele, a thriving market community. The parish of Yeovil was part of the Stone Hundred. After the Norman Conquest, the manor, later known as Hendford, was granted to the Count of Eu and his tenant Hugh Maltravers, whose descendants became Earls of Arundel and held the lordship until 1561. In 1205 it was granted a charter by King John. By the 14th century, the town had gained the right to elect a portreeve. The Black Death exacted a heavy toll, killing approximately half the population. In 1499 a major fire destroyed many of the wooden, thatched roofed buildings in the town. Yeovil suffered further fires, in 1620 and again in 1643. After the dissolution of the monasteries the lord of the manor was the family of John Horsey of Clifton Maybank from 1538 to 1610 and then by the Phelips family until 1846 when it passed to the Harbins of Newton Surmaville. Babylon Hill across the River Yeo to the south east of the town was the site of a minor skirmish, the Battle of Babylon Hill, during the English Civil War, which resulted in the Earl of Bedford's Roundheads forcing back Sir Ralph Hopton's Cavaliers to Sherborne. During the 1800s Yeovil was a centre of the glove making industry and the population expanded rapidly. In the mid 19th century it became connected to the rest of Britain by a complex set of railway lines which resulted from competition between the 7 ft 2,134 mm broad gauge lines of the Great Western Railway GWR and the 4 ft 8 12 in 1,435 mm standard gauge lines of the London and South Western Railway LSWR . In 1853 the Great Western Railway line was opened between Taunton and Yeovil. The first railway in the town was a branch line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway near Taunton to a terminus at Hendford on the western side of the town, which opened on 1 October 1853. As an associated company of the GWR, this was a broad gauge line. The GWR itself opened Yeovil Pen Mill railway station on the east side of the town as part of its route from London on 1 September 1856 this was extended to Weymouth on 1 January 1857 , and the original line from Taunton was connected to this. The LSWR route from London reached Hendford on 1 June 1860 but a month later the town was by passed by the extension of the LSWR to Exeter. A new station at Yeovil Junction was provided south of the town from where passengers could catch a connecting service to Hendford. On 1 June 1861 passenger trains were withdrawn from Hendford and transferred to a new, more central, Yeovil Town railway station. In 1854, the town gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 inhabitants and was dominated by the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst of the bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high explosive bombs fell on the town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged. Industrial businesses developed in the area around the Hendford railway goods station to such a degree that a small Hendford Halt was opened on 2 May 1932 for passengers travelling to and from this district, but the growth of road transport and a desire to rationalise the rail network led to half of the railway stations in Yeovil being closed in 1964. First to go was Hendford Halt which was closed on 15 June along with the line to Taunton, then Yeovil Town closed on 2 October. Long distance trains from Pen Mill had been withdrawn on 11 September 1961, leaving only Yeovil Junction with a service to London, but the service between there and Pen Mill, the two remaining stations, was also withdrawn from 5 May 1968. As a former centre of Britain's leather industry, the town is post industrial in character. Journalist John Harris, for instance, described the towns Taunton, Yeovil and Bridgwater as a post industrial, hardscrabble place that contain 19 of the council wards in the 20 of English areas classed as the most deprived. Officially designated as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854, the town continued to lend its name to the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974, with the merging several neighbouring rural and urban districts, which is today known as South Somerset. Some of the suburbs fall within the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton. Yeovil still has a town council which took over the functions of the Charter Trustees in 1982. The council has responsibility for the management of recreational and leisure facilities, open spaces and play areas. In 2005, Yeovil Town Council became the first large council in Somerset to be awarded Quality Town Council status. There are five electoral wards covering Yeovil. Yeovil is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament MP by the first past the post system of election. The constituency covers the towns of Yeovil, Chard, Crewkerne and Ilminster, all in Somerset. Until 1983 Somerset was split into four constituencies and Yeovil constituency also contained the towns of Ilchester, Martock and Somerton, but these were moved into the newly created constituency of Somerton and Frome. From the next election, Yeovil constituency will contain Ilchester once again to equalise the populations of the Somerset constituencies. The Boundary Commission for England estimate the electorate of Yeovil constituency after the pending boundary changes to be 77,049. The current MP is Marcus Fysh, a member of the Conservative Party. Yeovil also forms part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament. There is, in Johannesburg, South Africa, a suburb called Yeoville which has a link to Yeovil. It was proclaimed in 1890 by one Thomas Yeo Sherwell, a native of Yeovil. He named the streets after his sons, friends and business associates. Yeovil is situated at the southern boundary of Somerset, close to the border with Dorset, 130 miles 209 km from London, 40 miles 64 km south of Bristol and 30 miles 48 km from Taunton. It lies in the centre of the Yeovil Scarplands, a major natural region of England. The suburbs include Summerlands, Hollands, Houndstone, Preston Plucknett, Penn Mill, New Town, Hendford, Old Town, Forest Hill, Abbey Manor, Great Lyde. Outlying villages include East Coker, West Coker, Hardington Mandeville, Evershot, Halstock, Stoford, Barwick, Sutton Bingham, Mudford and Yetminster. Other nearby villages include Bradford Abbas, Thornford Corscombe, Montacute where one will find Montacute House , and Pendomer. The village of Brympton, now almost a suburb of Yeovil, contains the medieval manor of Brympton d'Evercy. Tintinhull is also a village close to Yeovil featuring the National Trust owned Tintinhull House and Gardens. Ninesprings Country Park is in the south east near Penn Hill. It is linked to by a cycle way following the route of the old railway to Riverside Walk, Wyndham Hill and Summerhouse Hill forming the 40 hectare 99 acre Yeovil Country Park. Along with the rest of South West England, Yeovil has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is about 10 C 50.0 F and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1 C 33.8 F and 2 C 35.6 F . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 22 C 71.60 F . The south west of England is in a favoured location for the Azores high pressure zone, when it extends north eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. However, convective cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine, whose annual average annual is about 1,700 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter, when most of the rain that falls in the south west is from that source. Average rainfall is about 725 millimetres 28.5 in . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south west. Yeovil urban area had a population of 41,871 at the 2001 census, but in 2011 the civil parish was home to 30,378. The parish consists of Yeovil Central Ward, population 7230, Yeovil East 7300, Yeovil South 7802, and Yeovil West 7280. The urban area also includes Yeovil Without, with a population of 7260, and Brympton, with 5268. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, Honeywell builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Yeovil's reputation as a centre of the aircraft and defence industries lived on into the 21st century, despite attempts at diversification and the creation of numerous industrial estates. The principal employer is the aviation group AgustaWestland, created through the acquisition of Westland Helicopters by Finmeccanica in 2000. In January 1986 the proposed sale of Westland to the American Sikorsky Aircraft group led to the Westland affair, a crisis in the Thatcher government, the resignation of Michael Heseltine as Secretary of State for Defence and the resignation two weeks later of Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Leon Brittan, who admitted to leaking a governmental law officer's letter harshly critical of Heseltine. Yeovil Aerodrome ICAO EGHG , sometimes known as Yeovil Westland 'Judwin' to avoid confusion with nearby RNAS Yeovilton , is 1 nautical mile 1.9 km west of the town centre. British defence giant BAE Systems also operates a site producing high integrity networked software, primarily for the military. The Screwfix Direct company is based in Houndstone, having started life as the Woodscrew Supply Company in 1979 it is now a subsidiary of Kingfisher plc.

One symbol of Yeovil is Jack the Treacle Eater , a folly consisting of a small archway topped by a turret with a statue on top. This is actually located in the village of Barwick, just to the south of the town. The hamstone Abbey Farm House was built about 1420 by John Stourton II, known as Jenkyn, and the associated Abbey Barn dates from the same period. Hendford Manor in the centre of the town was built about 1720 and has since been converted into offices. It is a Grade II listed building.

"The Yermolayev Yer 2 Russian 2 was a long range Soviet medium bomber used during World War II. It was developed from the Bartini Stal 7 prototype airliner before the war. It was used to bomb Berlin from airbases in Estonia after Operation Barbarossa began in 1941. Production was terminated in August 1941 to allow the factory to concentrate on building higher priority Ilyushin Il 2 ground attack aircraft, but was restarted at the end of 1943 with new, fuel efficient, Charomskiy ACh 30B aircraft Diesel engines. Although designed as a long range medium bomber it was flown on tactical ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow with heavy losses. The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last examples were transferred to schools. However, the resumption of production in 1943 allowed the aircraft to resume combat operations in April 1945. The Yer 2 remained in service with Long Range Aviation until it was replaced by four engined bombers such as the Tupolev Tu 4 at the end of the 1940s. Roberto Bartini had designed and built the Stal 7 airliner whilst he was the chief designer at the ZOK NII GVF Russian Zavod Opytnykh Konstrooktsiy Naoochno Issledovatel'skogo Institoota Grazhdanskogo Vozdooshnogo Flota Factory for Special Constructions at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet . The performance of the Stal 7 was exceptional, particularly in respect to its payload at gross overload weight over 56 of the total weight was payload. During flight trials with maximum all up weight the prototype crashed on takeoff in early 1938, resulting in the arrest of Bartini and his imprisonment in a Siberian Gulag in February 1938. The Stal 7 lay unrepaired until Vladimir Yermolaev was appointed as chief designer at OKB 240 after Bartini's arrest, with the task of transforming the Stal 7 design into a long range bomber, a task made easier since Bartini had reserved space for a bomb bay in the fuselage. After repair the Stal 7 carried on with the flight test programme, including a record breaking nonstop flight on 28 August 1939 when it flew MoscowSverdlovskSevastopolMoscow a distance of 5,086 km 3,160 mi at an average speed of 405 km h 252 mph . Preliminary design of the DB 240 Russian dahl'niy bombardirovschik long range bomber , as the bomber version was designated, was completed by the beginning of 1939 and the construction of two prototypes began the following July. The DB 240 retained little apart from the general layout of the Stal 7 as the structure was almost completely redesigned. The pilot's cockpit was offset to port to improve his downward view and the navigator bomb aimer sat in the extensively glazed nose with a 7.62 millimeter 0.300 in ShKAS machine gun, the radio operator sat below and to starboard of the pilot and the dorsal gunner in a partially retractable turret with one 12.7 millimeter 0.50 in Berezin UBT machine gun. Another ShKAS was fitted in a ventral hatch. Up to 2,000 kg 4,409 lb of bombs could be carried in the bomb bay and two 500 kilogram 1,102 lb bombs could be carried externally. Up to 4,600 kg 10,141 lb of fuel could be carried. The DB 240 had been designed to use the experimental Klimov M 106 V12 engines, but the less powerful Klimov M 105 engine had to be substituted because the M 106 was not available. The DB 240 prototype flew for the first time on 14 May 1940 and began its State acceptance tests on 27 September 1940. The weaker engines prevented the DB 240 from reaching its designed performance. It could only attain 445 km h 277 mph at 4,250 m 13,944 ft instead of the expected 500 km h 311 mph at 6,000 meters 19,685 ft . Its defensive armament was deemed inadequate and other problems included an excessively long take off run and engine defects. However, these did not offset its virtues of a heavy bomb load and long range 4,100 kilometers 2,548 mi carrying 1,000 kg 2,205 lb of bombs . It was ordered into production at Factory No. 18, in Voronezh, as the Yermolayev Yer 2. Manufacture began in March 1941, with approximately 50 aircraft delivered by 22 June 1941. These aircraft were about 58 km h 3.15.0 mph slower than the prototype and their normal weight increased 1,220 kg 2,690 lb to 12,520 kg 27,602 lb . Production was terminated in August 1941 with only 128 built to allow the factory to concentrate on the higher priority Ilyushin Il 2 ground attack aircraft. A Yer 2 was modified with experimental Mikulin AM 37 engines, a reinforced undercarriage, armored seats for the navigator and gunner, and 12.7 mm UBT machine guns in place of its original ShKAS weapons. It first flew in July 1941 and was able to reach 505 km h 314 mph at 6,000 m 19,685 ft , but the range was reduced to 3,500 km 2,175 mi carrying 1,000 kg 2,205 lb of bombs. One significant problem with this version was the excessive takeoff roll which hindered operations from grass airstrips. The engine was unreliable, however, and had cooling problems that the Mikulin OKB did not have the resources to resolve so it was cancelled in October when the factory was forced to evacuate from Moscow by the German advance. The Charomskiy M 40F Diesel engine was also evaluated in a Yer 2 in 1941. This engine, like all Diesels, offered a greatly reduced fuel consumption compared to a standard gasoline powered engine, but at a great penalty in weight. These engines increased the gross takeoff weight to 13,500 kg 29,762 lb which required the undercarriage to be reinforced and the wing area increased to keep the same wing loading. The M 40F powered aircraft reached a maximum speed of 430 km h 267 mph at 6,050 m 19,849 ft . However, the M 40 was not yet ready for service use and the project was cancelled. The aircraft engine combination did have enough potential that development work continued using the closely related, but more mature, Charomskiy ACh 30B Diesel engine. The cockpit was modified to accommodate two pilots side by side and the wing and tailplane areas were increased. The 12.7 mm UBT machine gun in the dorsal turret was replaced by a 20 millimeter 0.79 in ShVAK cannon and the nose and ventral ShKAS machine guns were exchanged for 12.7 mm UBT machine guns. Up to 5,460 kg 12,037 lb of fuel could be carried. The Yer 2 ACh 30B was placed into production at Factory No. 39 in Irkutsk at the end of 1943 and the first production aircraft was submitted to its State acceptance trials the following month. Some excess aircraft were converted as Yer 2ON VIP transports. The Yer 2 was not in squadron service when Germany invaded on 22 June 1941, but the 420th and 421st Long Range Bomber Regiments Russian Dahl'niy Bombardirovchnyy AviapolkDBAP were formed shortly afterwards. However neither regiment flew any operational missions until later in the summer. On the evening of 10 August Yer 2s of the 420th DBAP, accompanied by Petlyakov Pe 8s of the 432nd DBAP, attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near Leningrad. The airfield was too short to accommodate a fully loaded Yer 2, but three bombers did manage to take off regardless. Two managed to bomb Berlin, or its outskirts, but only one successfully returned the other was shot down by 'friendly' Polikarpov I 16s when it reentered Soviet airspace and the third aircraft went missing. Three crews from the 420th DBAP bombed Konigsberg during the nights of 2829 and 30 August 1 September from Ramenskoye Airport, southeast of Moscow. On 1 October 1941 63 Yer 2s were in service, but only 34 were operational. The 420th DBAP had flown 154 sorties by the beginning of November 6 in August, 81 in September, 67 in October and had lost 30 of its 40 aircraft. Over half of these 19 were due to non combat losses. Losses were extremely high over the autumn and winter as they were inappropriately committed against German tactical frontline targets during the Battle of Moscow at low altitudes and only 12 were in service on 18 March 1942. On 4 August 1942 the 747th DBAP had only ten Yer 2s on hand and it was briefly committed during the Battle of Stalingrad. The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last few aircraft were transferred to schools by the 2nd Guards DBAP and the 747th DBAP. The Yer 2 was placed back into production at the end of 1943, but none of the new bombers had been issued to combat units by 1 June 1944. However 42 were in service on 1 January 1945 and 101 on 10 May 1945 after the war ended. The first combat mission undertaken by Yer 2s after they returned to production was a raid on Konigsberg on 7 April 1945 by the 327th and 329th Bomber Aviation Regiments Russian Bombardirovchnyy Aviatsionyy Polk . It remained in service with Long Range Aviation units until replaced by four engined bombers like the Tupolev Tu 4 in the late 1940s.

"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories is a picture book collection by Theodor Seuss Geisel, published under his more commonly known pseudonym of Dr. Seuss. It was first released by Random House Books on April 12, 1958, and is written in Seuss's trademark style, using a type of meter called anapestic tetrameter. Though it contains three short stories, it is mostly known for its first story, Yertle the Turtle , in which the eponymous Yertle, king of the pond, stands on his subjects in an attempt to reach higher than the moonuntil the bottom turtle burps and he falls into the mud, ending his rule. Though the book included burp , a word then considered to be relatively rude, it was a success upon publication, and has since sold more than a million copies. In 2001, it was listed at 125 on the Publishers Weekly list of the best selling children's books of all time. The eponymous story revolves around Yertle the Turtle, the king of the pond. Dissatisfied with the stone that serves as his throne, he commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see farther and expand his kingdom. However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him to be quiet. Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain and hunger to the turtles at the bottom of the pile. Again, Yertle yells at Mack to be quiet. Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something dares to be higher than Yertle the King , he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before he can give the command, Mack decides he has had enough. He burps, which shakes up Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him King of the Mud and freeing the others. The second story recounts the tale of the girl bird Gertrude McFuzz, who only has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for something that will make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. But because of the added weight of too many feathers, she is unable to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, hearing her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather leftas beforeshe now has enough, because now she is smarter. The third and final story tells of a rabbit and a bear, who both boast that they are the best of the beasts , because of the range of their hearing and smelling abilities, respectively. However, they are humbled by a worm who claims he can see all around the worldright back to his own hill, where he sees the rabbit and bear, whom he calls the two biggest fools that have ever been seen . A stack of turtles drawn similarly to those featured in Yertle the Turtle first appeared on March 20, 1942, in a cartoon for the New York City newspaper PM, where Seuss worked as an editorial cartoonist. The illustration shows two stacks of turtles forming the letter V on top of a large turtle labelled Dawdling Producers , with a caption reading You Can't Build A Substantial V Out of Turtles Seuss has stated that the titular character Yertle represented Adolf Hitler, with Yertle's despotic rule of the pond and takeover of the surrounding area parallel to Hitler's regime in Germany and invasion of various parts of Europe. Though Seuss made a point of not beginning the writing of his stories with a moral in mind, stating that kids can see a moral coming a mile off , he was not against writing about issues he said there's an inherent moral in any story and remarked that he was subversive as hell . Yertle the Turtle has variously been described as autocratic rule overturned , a reaction against the fascism of World War II , and subversive of authoritarian rule . In 2003, reporter John J. Miller also compared Yertle to the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, saying that ts final lines apply as much to Saddam Hussein as they once did to the European fascists . The last lines of Yertle the Turtle read And the turtles, of course ...all the turtles are free As turtles, and maybe, all creatures should be. When questioned about why he wrote maybe rather than surely , Seuss replied that he didn't want to sound didactic or like a preacher on a platform , and that he wanted the reader to say 'surely' in their minds instead of my having to say it. The use of the word burp plain little Mack did a plain little thing. He burped was also an issue before publication. According to Seuss, the publishers at Random House, including the president, had to meet to decide whether or not they could use burp because nobody had ever burped before on the pages of a children's book . However, despite the publishers' initial worries, it eventually proved to be a hitin 2001, Publishers Weekly reported that it was 125th on the list of best selling hardcover children's books in the United States, at just over one million copies. Dedication, Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories The book is dedicated to the Sagmaster family as a tribute to Joseph Sagmaster, who had introduced Seuss to his first wife, Helen Palmer, when they were both attending Oxford University. Sagmaster is quoted as saying that bringing the two together was the happiest inspiration I've ever had . Although Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories has not been directly adapted, several characters from the book have appeared in other media. Yertle is a character in the 19961997 television series The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, and in Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty's Broadway musical Seussical, Yertle serves as a judge and Gertrude McFuzz acts as Horton's love interest. The story was also turned into a dance number in the 1994 film In Search of Dr. Seuss. Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories is a 1992 animation directed by Ray Messecar and narrated by John Lithgow later released and cropped to widescreen format on Blu Ray part of Who's Who in the Dr. Seuss . The Red Hot Chili Peppers adapted the story in the song Yertle the Turtle on their second album, Freaky Styley, released in 1985. In 1961 RCA Camden Records released Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories with the three stories on the A side and Bartholomew and the Oobleck on the B side. The liner notes state set to dramatic action personally by Dr. Suess with music featuring Marvin Miller .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yertle%20the%20Turtle%20and%20Other%20Stories
"The Yes Album is the third studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released on 19 February 1971 by Atlantic Records. It is their first album with guitarist Steve Howe, who replaced Peter Banks in 1970, and their last to feature keyboardist Tony Kaye until 1983's 90125. The album was the first by the group not to feature any cover versions of songs. The band spent mid 1970 writing and rehearsing new material at a farmhouse at Romansleigh, Devon, and the new songs were recorded at Advision Studios in London in the autumn. While the album retained close harmony singing, Kaye's Hammond organ and Chris Squire's melodic bass, as heard on earlier releases, the new material also covered further styles including jazz piano, funk and acoustic music, with all band members contributing ideas, and tracks were extended in length to allow music to develop. Howe contributed a variety of guitar styles, including a Portuguese guitar, and recorded a solo acoustic guitar piece, Clap , live at the Lyceum Theatre, London. The album was a critical success and a major commercial breakthrough for Yes, who had been at risk of being dropped by Atlantic Records due to the commercial failures of their first two albums. It reached number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 40 in the United States, and was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for surpassing one million copies. The album has been reissued on CD several times, and was given a Blu ray release in 2014 remixed by Steven Wilson. Yes had already recorded two albums for Atlantic Records by mid 1970, but neither had been commercially successful and the label was considering dropping them. They had replaced founding member Banks with Howe, who enjoyed playing a wider variety of styles, including folk and country music, and played a mix of electric and acoustic guitars. Singer Jon Anderson later said that Howe could jump from one thing to the other, very fast, very talented. After some warm up gigs with Howe, the band moved to Devon to write and rehearse new material. They arrived at a cottage in Churchill, north of Barnstaple, but the group felt restricted there and were not allowed to make any noise after dark. They advertised in the local paper for a new location, and moved to Langley Farm in Romansleigh, near South Molton, some 20 miles away. Howe in particular enjoyed working on the farm, and eventually bought it. Following rehearsals, the band booked Advision Studios in London with producer Eddie Offord and spent the autumn recording. The band enjoyed the sessions, and soon had enough material ready for an album. In November 1970, the group were involved in a car accident returning from a gig in Basingstoke. The band all suffered shock, and Kaye broke a foot. He had to do the next few gigs, and the album cover's photo shoot, with it in plaster. Howe mostly used a Gibson ES 175 semi acoustic guitar and a Martin 00 18 acoustic for recording, though he did attempt to play a variety of styles with the two instruments. Kaye's main instruments were the Hammond organ and piano, including a solo on A Venture . Kaye had previously played the Hammond M 100, but for this album used the B 3, a move which he saw as a turning point . He was not interested in playing synthesizers, which had started to appear on the market. This proved to be a problem with the other members of the band, and Kaye thought his style conflicted too much with Howe's. He left the group during rehearsals for the follow up album in mid 1971, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman. Yes had started their career as a covers band, performing radical re arrangements of hit songs, and their first two albums included covers in this vein. The Yes Album was the first to feature group written material in its entirety. Some familiar elements remained Anderson, Howe and Squire sang three part vocal harmony throughout the record, while Squire's melodic bass and Bill Bruford's spacious drumming made up their unique rhythm section. Yours Is No Disgrace originated from some lyrics written by Anderson with his friend David Foster. This was combined with other short segments of music written by the band in rehearsals. Howe worked out the opening guitar riff on his own while the rest of the band took a day's holiday. The backing track was recorded by the group in sections, then edited together to make up the final piece. Howe's solo acoustic tune, Clap incorrectly titled The Clap in original album pressings , was influenced by Chet Atkins and Mason Williams' Classical Gas . The piece was written to celebrate the birth of Howe's son Dylan on 4 August 1969. The version that appears on the album was recorded live at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1970. The studio take of the piece, which was added as a bonus track on the 2003 Rhino remaster, continues into a section that would return almost unaltered in Howe's next solo acoustic piece Mood for a Day on their next album, Fragile. The spacey, electronic sounding effect in Starship Trooper was achieved by running the guitar backing track through a flanger. Anderson wrote the bulk of the song, while Squire wrote the Disillusion section in the middle. The closing section, Wurm is a continuous cadenza of chords G E C played ad lib. It evolved from a song called Nether Street by Howe's earlier group, Bodast. I've Seen All Good People is a suite of two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into the funky second movement. The band had difficulty recording the initial Your Move section, which was resolved by making a tape loop of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Portuguese 12 string guitar, miscrediting it as a vachalia on the album's credits. Gnidrolog's Colin Goldring played recorder on the track. The group also used a Dewtron bass pedal synthesizer on the track, which Anderson would then play in concert. Anderson wrote A Venture in the studio the song was then arranged by the rest of the band. Kaye played piano on the track, contributing a jazzy solo towards the end. Howe played a guitar solo on the original recording, but it was left off the final mix, which faded out just as it started. The song was never played live by the original group, but an arrangement was worked out when Yes decided to play the whole album live in 2013. Anderson was inspired to write the lyrics for Perpetual Change by the view of the countryside from the cottage at Churchill. The middle of the track features a polyrhythmic structure, where two pieces of music in different time signatures are playing simultaneously. The front cover was shot by Phil Franks the day after the Basingstoke gig accident. Franks had already taken some photos from the Lyceum gig, but felt he needed something more for the front cover. The band showed up late having been in hospital earlier that day, and only 30 minutes were available for a shoot. Unable to get a satisfactory photo in the studio, Franks took the band round to his flat, grabbed a polystyrene mannequin head from a bin, put a 1,000 watt bulb in the kitchen light fitting, and improvised the shot. Franks credited the sleeve designer, Rolling Stone art director Jon Goodchild, for making the cover a success. When Yes performed a live version of Yours is No Disgrace for the German television series Beat Club in April 1971, footage of the band was combined with that of another mannequin head spinning over a chair, mimicking the cover's concept. The inside of the album's gatefold sleeve shows Kaye playing a Hammond organ, while the front cover showed his leg in plaster, following the accident. Anderson is credited as John Anderson on the album but he had dropped the h from his first name by the next album, Fragile. The Yes Album was released in the UK on 19 February 1971. It was a commercial success and was the band's breakthrough album, selling around 60,000 copies upon release and reaching number 4 in the UK. and number 40 in the US. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over one million copies. Squire later said a key reason for the success was that there was a postal strike which prevented chart returns being sent, and reducing the available ones to a few retailers in London. Yes had the largest fanbase in these stores, and that allowed a good chart position. By the time the strike had ended, the album had started to sell well due to its initial apparent success. The 1976 Italian reissue of the album differs from the original UK issue in two respects. The title on the front cover is The Yes instead of The Yes Album , although the spine bears the correct title and the track The Clap appears as the third track on the second side. The album had a positive reception from critics. John Koegel, writing for Rolling Stone, praised the instrumental unity between Squire, Howe and Kaye, but missed the cover songs present in the band's earlier albums. The album is one of three by Yes to appear in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. Author Tom Moon preferred the group unity that he felt was missing on later releases and gave a positive impression of Anderson's vocals, saying the melodies in I've Seen All Good People were instantly singable and still somehow deep. The album is also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Anderson was worried about the initial response to the album, but after about a month noticed that fans started singing along at concerts, and concluded that this musical style could be developed and still remain popular. Kaye concluded that overall it was quite a simple album, considering where Yes went onto from there. Rush singer and bassist Geddy Lee included The Yes Album among his favourite albums. Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks has said it is his favourite Yes album and that he preferred the band when Kaye was a member. It was the addition of Steve Howe's guitar pyrotechnics that finally allowed Yes to find their true identity. The Yes Album is a giant leap forward, wrote J. D. Considine in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide. The Yes Album was remastered and reissued in 2003 by Rhino Records with several bonus tracks, including a studio version of Clap , entitled as Howe intended. In 2014, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree created a new stereo mix and a 5.1 surround sound mix, available as either a DVD or Blu ray Disc. It was released on 21 April with bonus tracks including the studio version of Clap , an extended version of A Venture , and an alternate version of the album with live tracks, single edits, and an extended mix. The Blu ray version also features an instrumental version of the album, a needle drop sample of the original vinyl release, and additional live tracks.

The viewership was up over 15 from the previous episode, Extraordinary Merry Christmas , which was seen by 481,000 viewers. Yes No received mixed reviews from critics. Robert Canning of IGN gave it a good rating of 7 out of 10, and noted hit and miss musical performances, random quirky and funny bits, and storytelling choices that kind of sort of work . TVLine's Michael Slezak was more enthusiastic, and said it was the best episode of the third season he credited both Helen Mirren and some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters . Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented that Glee had returned to its frequent habit of dropping plot twists on us that come out of nowhere , and MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan wrote that the episode's promising bright spots couldn't escape from under the weight of the show's typical mistakes . Reviewers were unhappy with most of the marriage storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a jackass throughout and called the storyline so pathetic and sad , words echoed by Entertainment Weekly's Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents. John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, Will desperately needs to make some grown up friends , a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV's Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness he felt using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person . There was broad agreement regarding the scene where Will asks Finn to be his best man not one reviewer approved. Lynch called it questionable and said it crossed a line of weirdness , Slezak and TV Guide's Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate, if not unethical, and Bell said the actual request was the episode's biggest WTF moment . Will's statement that Finn had taught him more about being a man was met with incredulity. Slezak declared Finn has a lot of growing up to do before he's really a man , and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted like a petulant man boy on the show, Will must have been referring to events in a season of Glee that didn't air . Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter, however she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father one of Cory Monteith's best scenes yet , and Slezak described it as beautifully handled by Monteith. Finn's marriage proposal to Rachel at the end of the episode was controversial. Reviewers thought it was a bad ideaKubicek declared, No one in high school should get engaged but Poniewozik wrote that it made a lot of sense for Finn as a character, and VanDerWerff said the scene worked for him. Becky's storyline was acclaimed by most reviewers. Canning called it exceptional and the most emotional and satisfying of the episode . Poniewozik also praised it, and wrote, Artie and Becky's arc, on the other hand, really worked it was sweet, uncomfortable and messy in the way that Glee does well. He continued, it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky's condition but because of what theyre like as people . VanDerWerff said the story was handled with just the right level of pathos , and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky into a fully realized character, while confronting head on the dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with Down Syndrome . Sullivan wrote, The plot touched on a universal experience, unrequited love, from a very Glee perspective, the treatment of handicapped people as people. It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky's touching dynamic. Bell liked Sue in this episode, as she was helping the plot, which in turn made her one liners added treats rather than overdone cliches . The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky's thoughts was highly praised. Poniewozik called it the kind of ridiculous but weirdly logical move I love from Glee , and Lynch said it was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while . Sullivan wrote that both actresses turned in great performances that elevated the episode significantly . Not all reviewers agreed, however Futterman called Mirren's vocal cameo bizarre , and although Kubicek thought Mirren was pretty darn hilarious , he said the Becky having a crush on Artie story arc made him feel as uncomfortable as the members of New Directions, and stated, It's easy to say that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else, but actually doing it is somewhat problematic. The cameo appearance of NeNe Leakes as Coach Roz Washington received plaudits from most reviewers. Poniewozik described her as pretty damn excellent , and Votta wrote, She only has one generally pointless scene but is arguably the best part of the whole episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal said Leakes does well , and Bell stated she actually wasn't that bad . Kubicek, however, while he liked the writing for the character, wrote that Leakes was an embarrassingly terrible actress . The opening number of the show received the most disparate reviews from critics. Kubicek was one of the most enthusiastic about Summer Nights , and wrote, This is the kind of ridiculous, over the top, hilariously cheesy stuff I want to see from Glee all the time. He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines, and Sugar was being embraced as a part of the group . Lynch thought that Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully , and gave this easily the most fun number of the episode an A . Stanhope said that the energy is infectious and you can feel the sparks between the former pair , but the performance was way too much of a copycat of the original Grease scene, while Flandez said that the two leads lacked chemistry and that the number was inexplicable . VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed dumb and unnecessary . Chaney wrote that the number was a high energy, cute way for the show to mark its comeback , but said that Rory sounded flat on one of his lines, and Sam couldnt quite hit the ending high note in the song, and graded it a B . Wedding Bell Blues was described by Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle as the perfect combination of a great song, plot relevance, and Princess Beatrice hat . Stanhope agreed with him on all three points, and added that it was a great pick for her vocals . Slezak described those vocals as a breath of dewy spring air and gave the song an A , but Lynch thought Emma was not much of a singer and gave the number a B , though he said the curiosity of backup vocals from Coach Beiste and Sue Sylvester made this entirely worthwhile . Poniewozik characterized the staging of the song as phoned in . The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face was given an A by Lynch and an A by Slezak the latter called the vocals pretty electrifying . Flandez said the song was sublime and complimented the lighting, the mood, and the direction by Eric Stoltz, and VanDerWerff described it as the episode's best single number . While Futterman thought the performers sang with controlled power , she felt singing it dressed in black with tears rolling down was funereal rather than bridal, and Sullivan called it an odd song choice that was made worse by Lea Michele's cry singing . Chaney gave the song her lowest grade of the episode, a C , and characterized it as a flagrant eye watering fest . Flandez called the propulsive mash up of Moves Like Jagger and Jumpin' Jack Flash one of the episode's highlights , and Billboard's Rae Votta said it was impeccably choreographed by Glee's often unsung hero Zach Woodlee. She also lauded Artie's Jagger moves while sitting in a chair and said he outshines even Mike and Will who dance beside him . Sullivan described Artie as consistently awesome , and Slezak said it was one of Arties more appealing musical moments this season and gave it a B . Lynch characterized the song as a spunky diversion and gave it a B , but he noted it was not a good song for marriage proposals by any stretch of the imagination , a point also made by Rolling Stone's Erica Futterman, who said the number would have fared much better as a stand alone performance . While Chaney liked Will and Mike's moves , she felt there was far too much quick cutting to shots of Morrison in a tank top and gave the song a B Slezak and VanDerWerff were also critical of these shots. Futterman was impressed that in Without You , Glee crafted a cover to rival the original , and said it totally works . Slezak called it a vocally stunning reimagining and gave it an A . Both Lynch and Chaney gave it a B , and the latter wrote I can't deny that she sang the heck out of it . Chaney was not so pleased with We Found Love , to which she gave a C . She wrote that it was part old Esther Williams movie, part classic 'SNL' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for 'Magic' by the Cars. In short, it was kind of a train wreck. However, she and Stanhope, who said it was way too fast paced , were in the minority. Lynch called it sheer pleasure and gave it an A , and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an A grade and described it as a sublimely, ridiculously, excessively terrific production number which he placed in the show's all time Top 10 . VanDerWerff praised the nice sense of visual spectacle , and Hankinson called it really fantastic and something different . Futterman, after she admitted to her unabashed love of the song, noted that the show had found the trifecta of a current song that both fits the overall theme of the show and the characters singing it . Five of the six singles released from the episode, which included a total of seven cover versions due to the Moves Like Jagger Jumpin' Jack Flash mash up, debuted on the Billboard Hot 100. Without You debuted at number twenty eight, followed by We Found Love at number fifty six, the aforementioned Moves Like Jagger Jumpin' Jack Flash mash up at number sixty two, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face at number seventy and Summer Nights at number eighty eight. The same five songs charted in Canada on the Canadian Hot 100 and in the same order on that chart Without You at number twenty nine, We Found Love at number fifty five, Moves Like Jagger Jumpin' Jack Flash at number fifty nine, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face at number seventy eight and Summer Nights at number eighty five. The sixth single, Wedding Bell Blues , did not appear on either chart.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes/No%20%28Glee%29
"Yes I Am a Long Way from Home is the opening track on the Scottish post rock band Mogwai's 1997 debut album, Mogwai Young Team. It was primarily composed by the band's bassist, Dominic Aitchison, prior to the 1997 Mogwai Young Team recording sessions. The song features electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit, organ, and glockenspiel, bookended by sampled monologues from friends of the band. It is an example of the predominantly electric guitar based genre the band employed at the time featuring quiet, clean sections contrasting with loud, distorted sections, sometimes connected with crescendos and diminuendos. This dynamic contrast was referred to by the band as serious guitar music. Yes I Am a Long Way from Home received a positive reception from music journalists, with album reviews focusing mainly on the effectiveness of the dynamic contrast featured within the song, the band's usage of instrumentation, and the track's overall representation of the band's genre at the time. The first live performance documented of Yes I Am a Long Way from Home was on 6 April 1997 at Highbury Garage in Londonthe band's first show promoting the Ten Rapid Collected Recordings 19961997 compilation album. This performance, as well as several other performances of the track throughout 1997, was instrumental. During this period, Yes I Am a Long Way from Home sometimes went under the title of New Dom . The song took its title from an exclamation from Lee Cohen, a Chicagoan friend of the band, at Brighton in May 1997. The band recorded Yes I Am a Long Way from Home during the Mogwai Young Team sessions from July to August 1997 at MCM Studios in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where the band had previously recorded the majority of their earlier material. The song was produced by Mogwai and Paul Savage, who handled production and mixing duties on the bulk of the band's previous recordings. Yes I Am a Long Way from Home is 5 minutes 58 seconds long, in the key of A major, in 4 4 time. The song begins with an organ pedal point of an A note, accompanied by a recording of a monologue passage from a Bergen Student Newspaper, being recited by Mari Myren, referring to when Mogwai played a show on 15 March 1997 at the Hulen, in Bergen, Norway. Myren describes the band's music as bigger than words and wider than pictures and states that If the stars had a sound, it would sound like this. The sound of clapping is heard, followed at 0 54 , by a bassline. This is joined at 1 09 by a soft drumbeat and a clean, two note guitar melody, based around the chord of A major. At 1 31 , the guitars and bass guitar modulate to the relative minor chord, F minor, and D major, and play alternate melody, before returning to the main melody. This is repeated until 2 32 , when the drumbeat gradually fades out, leaving only the ride cymbal keeping the beat, and the guitars, which repeat a melody based around the chord of A major, using harmonics. At 3 11 , the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at 3 42 into a distortion laden chord progression, using the chords F minor, D major, and A major. At 3 46 , a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until 5 09 , after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo laden feedback of the guitar. During professional reviews, Yes I Am a Long Way from Home received largely positive reception. Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine described the song as gorgeous, moving from a gentle beginning to a series of shattering crescendos , also noting that it describes almost all of Mogwais music at this stage of their career. David Wilson of The Daily Nebraskan described the song as having low key harmonics and delicate melody , followed by a blistering shard of explosive distortion out of nowhere , noting that the dynamic contrast within the song, sets the seesaw pace for the whole record. Lee Harvey of Vox also referred to the dynamic contrast, noting that it and you with gentle percussion, leaving you helpless before the surge of sky swallowing guitars that follows . Scott Irvine of UpBeetMusic described it as a standout track , also noting track alone is worth checking out 1997s best bet for an instrumental tour de force . Christopher Jackson of Fluffhouse described the track as a to the point introduction to the classic Mogwai sound elegant musings on a web of bass heavy guitars, growing patiently to a peak filled out with massive distorted chords and fat drum fills . Brandon Wu of Ground and Sky described the song's progression, with a quietly pretty melody . . . to a massive climax of guitar and bass noise. and woven through crescendo is a beautiful, lyrical guitar line . . . simply stunning.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%21%20I%20Am%20a%20Long%20Way%20from%20Home
"Yeshe O c. 9591040 spiritual names Jangchub Yeshe O, Byang Chub Ye shes' Od, Lha Bla Ma, Hla Lama Yeshe O, Lalama Yixiwo, bKra shis mgon also Dharmaraja 'Noble King' was the first notable lama king in Tibet. Born as Khor re, he is better known as Lhachen Yeshe O, his spiritual name. Yeshe O was the second king in the succession of the kingdom of Guge in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. The extent of the kingdom was roughly equivalent to the area of the kingdom Zhangzhung that had existed until the 7th century. Yeshe O abdicated the throne in c. 975 to become a lama. In classical Tibetan historiography, the restoration of an organized and monastic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism is attributed to him. He built Tholing Monastery in 997 when Tholing was the capital of Guge. Yeshe O' sponsored noviciates, including the great translator Rinchen Zangpo. From a young age, Yeshe O was interested in religious matters. He was the son of king Tashi gon bKra shis mgon , and ruled the merged the kingdoms of Tashigon and Detsugon, covering the regions of Purang and Guge and Zanskar, Spiti and Lahaul and Upper Kinnaur. He ruled over the combined Purnag Guge Kingdom from 967. Yeshe O', better known by his spiritual name, Lhachen Yeshe O, was the first notable lama king in Tibet. His first act as king was to issue commands decreed under the title bka shog chen mo 'Great Dictums' , which reflected his primary aim of ruling his kingdom theocratically it was the reason that he came to be known as 'a king and monk'. This orientation was to ensure propagation of Buddhism throughout Tibet. He commanded farmers and nomads to pay an endowment fee towards the maintenance of the monastery. The 'second diffusion of Buddhism' in Tibet is solely attributed to Yeshe O. He believed in reforming his kingdom under the ethos of three R s namely, religious education, religious architecture, and religious reform, during a time when the Indian Buddhist religious, artistic, architectural, scriptural and philosophical traditions permeated all the Tibetan world through Guge. Based on the practices followed in India, Yeshe O deputed twenty one specially chosen young novitiates to be trained as monks in Kashmir and other parts of India. They were to study under Indian Buddhist Gurus in renowned institutions, and to translate Buddhist scriptures from the Sanskrit to Tibetan. Of the novitiates, only two survived, Rinchen Zangpo and Lekpai Sherap. The others succumbed to the extreme weather conditions of northern India. Rinchen Zangpo was such an impressive student that Yeshe O made him responsible for the translation of other Sanskrit scriptures, as well as the building of monasteries in Tibet. The first one in western Tibet, Tholing, was built in 997, after Yeshe O had been king for thirty years. The other main monasteries built under the king's initiative were Tabo Monastery in Ladakh, and the Khochar monastery. He ruled, along with his brother, the entire Western Himalayan region. He founded temples and encouraged the nobility of Tibet. He opposed the esoteric forms of tantric practices mostly by non organised groups which were prevalent in Tibet, and felt revulsion about the introduction of Tantrism into Tibet's new culture of Buddhism. His wish was to maintain a purer and more rationalistic form of religion in Tibet, and his views were quoted in the Blue Annals, written in the fifteenth century. The large number of bronze works of art made of are credited to Nagaraja, one of his two sons. The tenth century Yeshe O temple is currently under reconstruction after the Red Guards damaged it during the Cultural Revolution in 1967. In the Lotsava Lakhang in Riba, in Ngari Prefecture, field research revealed a painting of eight monks, including Rinchen Zangpo, sent to Kashmir by Yeshe O to bring texts of scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism from there to western Tibet.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshe-%C3%96
"Yesterday's Wine is the thirteenth studio album and a concept album by country singer Willie Nelson. Nelson had been recording for RCA Victor since the early 1960s, and had no significant hits. By 1970, his recordings had reached mid chart positions. Nelson lost the money from his song writing royalties by financing unsuccessful concert tours that were generally unprofitable. In addition to problems with his music career, Nelson had problems in his personal life. He had divorced his wife, Shirley Collie, and his Tennessee ranch had been destroyed by a fire. After moving to a new home in Bandera, Texas, Nelson was called by RCA producer Felton Jarvis about the upcoming scheduled recording sessions. At the time, Nelson had not written any new material. He returned to Nashville, where he wrote new songs to use with others from his old repertoire. These new concept songs were recorded at the RCA studio in Nashville in just two days. Recognized today as Country Music's first true concept album, Yesterday's Wine is the story of the Imperfect Man , from the moment he is born to the day of his death. RCA originally released the singles Yesterday's Wine and Me and Paul . The former peaked at number 62 in Billboard's Hot Country Singles. The album failed to reach the charts, and a frustrated Nelson decided to temporarily retire from music, while still under contract to RCA Records. Later with his musical style revitalized, he returned to music in 1972. By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved from Monument Records to RCA Victor, under the leadership of Chet Atkins, signing a contract for US 10,000 per year. During his first few years at RCA Victor, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969 his singles reached the top 25 consistently One In a Row number 19, 1966 , The Party's Over number 24 during a 16 week chart run in 1967 , and his cover of Morecambe Wise's Bring Me Sunshine number 13, March 1969 . Up to 1970, Nelson had no major success. His royalties were invested in tours that did not produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near Bandera, Texas and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single I'm a Memory reached the top 30. Felton Jarvis contacted Nelson for the recording of his next album. Nelson had not written any material for the sessions by the time he arrived in Nashville in April 1971. While living in the new ranch, Nelson read the Bible, Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, the works of Edgar Cayce and Episcopal priest A.A Taliaferro's work. Inspired by his readings, Nelson decided to work in new material. On May 12, he wrote nine songs, combining new ones with previous material from his repertoire, such as Family Bible , to create the concept for the album. He recorded Yesterday's Wine in four sessions, backed by David Zettner and the studio session players, beginning with two sessions on May 3 and finishing with the last two on May 4. In his 2015 autobiography, Nelson reminisced about this turbulent time in his life Nelson had recorded a concept album previously about his home state called Texas in My Soul, which had been the brainchild of RCA head Chet Atkins, but Yesterdays Wine was far bolder, contemplating his mortality as the imperfect man, an idea that was so far out that when it came time to record in early May of 1971 producer Felton Jarvis had no choice but to let the tapes roll. The album describes the life of a man, called The Imperfect Man , from the beginning to the day of his death. The story begins with a dialog between two characters. The first asks the other You do know why you're here , and the second replies Yes, there's great confusion on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following Perfect man has visited earth already and His voice was heard The voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest and I have been selected as the most likely candidate. This statement is followed by Where's the Show and Let Me Be a Man . In the medley, Nelson depicts the birth of the character, who implores God to become a man. The song is followed by In God's Eyes , depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In Family Bible , the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the family Bible. It's Not for Me to Understand depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command . In the last stanza, the character now expresses his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley These Are Difficult Times Remember the Good Times , describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times. Summer of Roses depicts the character falling in love and in the prime of his life. It is followed by the anticipation of the beginning of the end in December Day , as the character announces This looks like a December day. It looks like we've come to the end of the way . Yesterday's Wine finds the character drinking in a bar, talking to the regulars about his life, and reflecting on aging. In Me and Paul , the Imperfect Man remembers the circumstances in which he lived with a friend in past times. The album ends with Goin' Home , as the character watches his own funeral. Although it was perhaps the LP's most accessible track, and has since become regarded as one of Nelson's finest compositions, the title track a tale of two old friends meeting up unexpectedly in a bar after many years limped to 62 on the Billboard country survey. In 1982 Merle Haggard and George Jones recorded a duet of Yesterday's Wine which became a 1 single, remaining so for one week and spending a total of ten weeks on the chart. Yesterdays's Wine also contains two love ballads, December Day and Summer of Roses, with Nelson later remembering, I couldnt write a suite of songs, no matter how spiritual, without reference to romance, calling Summer of Roses and December Day love poems. In the first song, love was fleeting, tragically brief in the second, love was remembered... December Day had been recorded previously for Nelsons 1969 LP Good Times. Family Bible was another old tune that Nelson, a struggling songwriter at the time, sold to Paul Buskirk for fifty dollars Buskirk took it to Claude Gray, who scored a number 7 hit with it in 1960. A song about his own youth, Nelson later insisted, There could be no Yesterdays Wine without Family Bible. In his memoir Nelson wrote that Me and Paul was a song that described the road that my drummer and best friend, Paul English, and I had been riding together. Yesterdays Wine marked the beginning of the end of Willies relationship with RCA Records. In 2015 Nelson recalled one RCA Records executive telling him, Its your f ckin worst album to date. Nelson also quoted somebody at RCA as opining, This is some far out shit that maybe the hippies high on dope can understand, but the average music lover is gonna think youve lost your cotton pickin mind. Nelson felt at the end of his rope RCA appeared to finally realize its folly five years later when Jerry Bradley included the album's title track and Me and Paul on the platinum selling RCA compilation LP Wanted The Outlaws after Nelson's popularity had exploded. The songs were a perfect fit for the outlaw themed record. RCA released the songs Yesterday's Wine and Me and Paul as singles. The song Yesterday's Wine peaked at number 62 in Billboard's Country Singles. The promotion of the album was complicated for RCA's marketing department by the changes of Imperfect Man between spirituality and mundane behavior. The album did not appear on any chart, failing to satisfy RCA's expectations. Although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire because of the number of failures he had had. Nelson later wrote in his autobiography, I think it's one of my best albums, but Yesterday's Wine was regarded by RCA as way too spooky and far out to waste promotion money on. Nelson returned to music in the following year, as his style was influenced in the Armadillo World Headquarters. Music critic Robert Christgau wrote The great Nashville songsmith has never bowled anyone over with his singing, and here he finds the concept to match. Most of these songsthough not the two best, Yesterday's Wine and Me and Paul are on religious themes, which tends to limit their general relevance. Nathan Bush wrote for Allmusic 'Summer of Roses', 'December Day', and the title track songs that detail a sense of longing and loss with the changing seasons mirroring the narrator's own life ... many of the numbers stand on their own, outside the album context. 'Family Bible', 'Me and Paul', and the title track are all particularly fine examples of Nelson's songcraft. As a whole, Yesterday's Wine provides further insight into the development of his art during this prolific period. The New York Times later described Yesterday's Wine as the last and best of Nelson's Nashville albums , saying that it was Organized in the manner of an epic poem, each cut a metaphor in the journey through life ... it was Nashville's first fully conceived concept album, and nobody knew what to make of it. It soon disappeared quietly and utterly. Rolling Stone wrote is the first of his bold, conceptual departures from country's hits plus filler norm. Rather than tack rock guitar riffs onto modern honky tonk sagas, Nelson absorbed the innovations of Bob Dylan and the singer songwriters into his own distinct style. Even if the narrative concepts don't always hold together, Willie hangs his most ambitious albums on some of his catchiest tunes. Author Michael Streissguth tried to be a concept album, but it lacked a clear thread, despite Willie's claim to the contrary. Robert Oermann and Douglas B. Green, in their book The Listener's Guide to Country Music, compared the album with Nelson's later recordings for Columbia Records All of those are beautiful records. They're all on Columbia and are made just the way Willie wanted them. It was not always so at his previous record label, RCA. Nevertheless, he made a few landmark recordings while he was with that company ... Few of the songs on Yesterday's Wine are well known Nelson compositions, but all are minor masterpieces . All tracks were composed by Willie Nelson except where indicated",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday%27s%20Wine

The majority of the film was shot in Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, mostly in Ramoji Film City, while two songs were shot in Switzerland and Bangkok. Released during the season of the Makar Sankranti festival, the film received decent feedback from critics. It grossed more than 600 million and collected a distributor share of 471 million, becoming one of the highest grossing Telugu films of 2014. The film was dubbed into Tamil as Magadheera and in Malayalam as Bhaiyya My Brother. Satya and Deepthi are lovers living in Visakhapatnam. A dreaded don, Veeru Bhai, lusts for Deepthi. When Deepthi's parents are killed, she and Satya escape. They board a bus on route to Hyderabad, but the bus is stopped unexpectedly and boarded by three men Veeru's henchman Deva, Veeru's brother Ajay, and a corrupt police inspector, Shravan. They kill Deepthi in front of Satya, and he suffers an almost fatal stab wound. Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death after stabbing him. However, Dr. Shailaja saves Satya by giving him a new face and skin. Ten months later, Satya wakes up from his coma. Under the pseudonym of Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Shruti, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Shruti, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a half constructed apartment or unconstructed building , where Satya kills Deva. A photo of Deva is discovered by assistant commissioner Ashok Varma, which has been marked with a 1 . Satya then files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Shravan knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him. During the investigation on Shravan's death, Satya presents himself to Varma as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall in love with Shruti and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pictures, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Shruti in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. Instead, Satya sends copies of the pictures to Veeru, to turn him against both Ajay and Shruti. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Shruti from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay, but Veeru is himself killed by Satya, who reveals his true identity. He apologises to Shruti for using her, before leaving. His vengeance fulfilled, Satya departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a stranger attacks Satya, but is killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Shailaja. When they meet, Shailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. Charan was a happy go lucky rich graduate who hung out with his friends and girlfriend, Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the slum people. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. Charan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, where Charan is stabbed to death. Charan's body is sent to Shailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Shailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital. Leaving Shailaja, Satya visits the slum, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. However, the mob, which has followed Satya, finally kills Dharma. Afterwards, Manju is shown living in a distant land, mourning Charan's death. The film ends with Satya meeting her. Dil Raju wanted to produce a technically driven film and selected a script written by Vamsi Paidipally. Raju announced the project officially in early October 2011, as well as announcing that Ram Charan would star as the film's protagonist. The project would be produced under the banner Sri Venkateswara Creations, with the details, including its cast and crew, announced shortly thereafter. Before sharing the script with Charan, Paidipally worked on it for nearly two months, choosing the action genre after having directed family dramas like Brindavanam 2010 . Devi Sri Prasad was confirmed as the film's music director in early November 2011, marking his first collaboration with both Paidipally and Charan. The music sittings were held at Goa. The film's production was officially launched on 9 December 2011, in Hyderabad the film's title was announced as Yevadu and a first look poster was unveiled on the same day. Paidipally based his screenplay from a story written by Vakkantham Vamsi. Anand Sai was the film's art director and completed his work by September 2013. Abburi Ravi contributed to the dialogues. C. Ram Prasad was the film's cinematographer, while Marthand K. Venkatesh was the film's editor. Ram Charan was signed as the protagonist in October 2011.

For the other pairing with Charan, in his alter ego role, Amy Jackson was selected to play the role of Shruti. This marked her debut in Telugu cinema, and she participated in various workshops to prepare herself for the role before joining the shoot. Jackson revealed that she was afraid to be seen as a glamorous young woman aiming to be an actress she worked hard to get her diction right and called the workshop an orientation programme to get her used to the Telugu language. For her role, she practised yoga, functional training, and went for jogs in and around Bandra bandstand in Mumbai, before rejoining the film's sets in Hyderabad. Kajal Aggarwal was signed for a cameo appearance and was paired with Arjun. Her inclusion was in doubt due to scheduling conflicts, but she eventually accepted the role, calling it a short and sweet one. Shweta Bhardwaj was approached to perform an item number in early May 2012, which she confirmed the news at the time, but added that although she was approached, she was not officially cast in the film. Scarlett Mellish Wilson was selected for an item number, which was supposed to be her first in Telugu However the film, Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu, was released earlier, making it her debut. Samantha walked out of the project in mid November 2012 due to creative differences. She was subsequently replaced by Shruti Haasan, who was reportedly paid a remuneration of 6 million, but her participation was delayed due to scheduling problems. Sai Kumar was signed as the main antagonist. Lyricist Sirivennela Sitaramasastri's second son, Raja, was signed for a supporting role.

Shashank and Prabhas Sreenu were seen in cameo roles. Principal photography began on 27 April 2012. Ram Charan was involved in two projects simultaneously, Yevadu and Zanjeer 2013 . After completing initial filming on Zanjeer, Charan joined the cast and crew of Yevadu on 8 May 2012, to shoot the item number, as well as scenes featuring him, Amy Jackson, and others. After this first phase of production, Charan was scheduled to go back to Bangkok to complete the filming schedule of Zanjeer, before rejoining the Yevadu production on 7 August 2012. Filming continued in Hyderabad until mid September 2012 after which production moved to Visakhapatnam on 14 September 2012. By early October 2012, 40 percent of the film was completed, consisting mostly of the first half. Shruti Haasan joined the film's sets on 24 January 2013. After a short break, filming recommenced on 5 March 2013, and by the end of the month, 90 percent of the film's speaking sequences were completed. Several action sequences were shot at Ramoji Film City in mid April 2013, under the supervision of Peter Hein. By then, the portions containing Arjun and Aggarwal were almost complete. The film's team left for Switzerland on 20 May 2013, to film a song sequence. Charan and Haasan were on location in Zurich, Switzerland to film one of the songs, which was completed by 27 May 2013. Primary filming recommenced on 29 May 2013, in Hyderabad, with Amy Jackson rejoining the production. The filming was expected to be wrapped up by 20 June 2013. In mid June 2013, a song featuring Charan was shot at Keesara Stretch, Ramoji Film City. Later, a song choreographed by Shekhar, and featuring Charan and Haasan was shot at Annapurna 7 Acres Studio. Meanwhile, a song featuring Charan and Jackson was shot in Bangkok. The song Freedom which was choreographed by Johnny, was shot in early July 2013 at Ramoji Film City. Principal photography came to an end on 22 July 2013 after the completion of Haasan's scenes. However, in late September 2013, some parts of the film were reportedly re shot and new scenes were added, in an effort to speed up the pace of the film, after the completion of censor formalities. Despite the film's writer, Vamsi, denying it in early June 2013, many critics believed the film was heavily inspired from John Woo's 1997 action film, Face Off, as well as bearing similarities to the Telugu films Chhatrapati 2005 and Vikramarkudu 2006 , both directed by S. S. Rajamouli. While critic Sangeetha Devi Dundoo called the film a combination of Face Off and Vikramarkudu, another critic, Karthik Pasupulate, wrote, This movie this isn't a rip off of Face Off. We don't have filmmakers who have the required creativity and technical know how to make half decent adaptation of that 1997 action thriller. The director just borrows the central idea to dish out another silly revenge drama. Devi Sri Prasad composed the film's soundtrack, which consists of six songs. Ramajogayya Sastry penned the lyrics for two songs, while Sirivennela Sitaramasastri, Chandrabose, Krishna Chaitanya and Sri Mani each wrote the lyrics for one song. Aditya Music acquired the audio rights. The soundtrack was released on 1 July 2013. After postponing several times, the audio was officially launched at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad on the same date i.e., 1 July 2013 where the star crew of the film attended the launch with Chiranjeevi as the main guest. The audio received positive reviews. The Times of India gave a review stating Devi Sri Prasad has come up with an album that is high on beat and low on melody, but plays to the galleries unabashedly, blending multiple genres. Though there isn't one stand out song, the album has an overriding happy vibe about it. It isn't a record that you will cherish for long, but might just swing along while it lasts and rated the album 3 5. Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating Devi Sri Prasad has composed some of the youthful and fresh tunes for the soundtracks. Having meaningful lyrics, some of the songs are very melodious and trendy. Devi Sri Prasad has used western instruments as well as rustic beats for them. A couple of songs offer a chance to Ram Charan Teja to show his dancing skills. Like his previous music albums, the composer has played it safe and all his songs are decent and appealing. The film was initially slated for a 14 July 2013 release, which was Charan's first wedding anniversary. After few delays, the film's release date was announced as 31 July 2013 to coincide with the fourth anniversary of Ram Charan's 2009 film Magadheera. After several delays, the film was rescheduled to open the same day as Pawan Kalyan's Attarintiki Daredi, but was postponed again to 21 August 2013. The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences. However, due to protests in Seemandhra over the Telangana State formation, the release of both the films were delayed. Raju scheduled the release on either Diwali or Christmas 2013, again postponing the release from 10 October to avoid another release conflict with Attarintiki Daredi. Due to Piracy issues, Attarintiki Daredi released on 27 September 2013 which forced Yevadu to enter the theatres as a December release. Dil Raju confirmed that the film's original and Malayalam dubbed version would release simultaneously on 19 December 2013. Regarding the film's release, Dil Raju said I'm planning to release the film on Dec 19 if the Telangana bill is not passed. I haven't decided on postponing the film, but if the bill is passed and it is likely create some agitation, then I plan to release the film during Sankranti next year in January . The film finally released on 12 January 2014 as a Sankranthi release clashing with 1 Nenokkadine, Veeram and Jilla at the worldwide box office. Sathyam Cinemas distributed the film in Chennai, where it released in 16 screens. A special paid premier show was held on 11 January 2014 at 9 00 PM and the money made from the premier show was donated to the construction of Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple in Mallepally. Bhadrakali Prasad acquired the film's Tamil dubbing rights under his banner Bhadrakali films. The Tamil dubbed version was titled Magadheera after the 2009 Telugu film of the same name. The film's dubbing activities commenced in July 2015. The film's posters were designed by Anil and Bhanu of AB Core Design. The first look poster was unveiled on 24 March 2013, featuring Charan with a rugged look. The first look teaser of 36 seconds was unveiled on 27 March 2013.

Charan released the second trailer of 85 seconds on 3 January 2014, at the Sandhya 70MM theatre in RTC X Roads. Hindustan Unilever became associated with the film by paying 10 million for co branding activity in terms of hoardings, television, radio, and print. MediaCorp did the marketing tie ups for the film. The film's official app was launched on 5 January 2014. While promoting the film, Shruti Haasan was admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad, and underwent treatment for suspected food poisoning. The promo of the song Cheliya Cheliya was unveiled on 7 January 2014. The film's crew visited Tirumala Temple on 17 January 2014, and made obeisance to Venkateswara, before interacting with the audience at Group Theatres. A press meet addressing the audience was held at Vijayawada on the next day, with Vamsi, Dil Raju, Sai Kumar, Shashank, L. B. Sriram, Raja and others in attendance. The promo of the song Ayyo Paapam was unveiled on 13 March 2014. The All India Film Employees Confederation mandated that all regional film productions employ at least 70 per cent local stuntmen. When the Chennai stunt masters, FEFSI Vijayan and Stunt Silva, failed to comply with this mandate, Andhra Pradesh stuntmen obstructed the film's production. K. Nagendra Prasad, a former councillor of Yemmiganur in Kurnool district, lodged a complaint with the police regarding a poster, alleging that it featured an image of a half nude Amy Jackson. Suits were filed, naming Ram Charan, Amy Jackson, Dil Raju, the film's presenter Anitha, co producer Sirish, the photographer, and the owner of the Raghavendra theatre which screened the film, citing section 292 of the IPC, as well as section 3 of the Indecent Representation of Women Prohibition Act of 1986. Vamsi defended that Jackson's still used in the poster was from a song sequence which had no obscenity in it and called the charges baseless. Justice K. G. Shankar of the High Court stayed the criminal cases on 28 July 2014. Just before the release of Race Gurram 2014 , stills of Shruti Haasan from the song Pimple Dimple, taken from obscene angles, were leaked on the internet. Shruti received huge criticism for the photos, while some called it a cheap publicity stunt. Regarding them, she said that those stills were neither pre approved by the production house or her and were shot during a song shoot and called the leakage a breach of trust. She filed a FIR in Hyderabad. CID began investigation in May 2014. They questioned administrators of the websites which uploaded the photos, and the photographers who reportedly supplied the photos to them. However, it was uncertain whether uploading the photographs, since they were taken in a public place, could be termed as illegal, and sought a legal opinion on how to go about the investigation. The film's television rights were acquired by MAA TV for an undisclosed price. The film registered a TRP rating of 10.14 during its television premiere. The television rights of the dubbed Malayalam version, Bhaiyya My Brother, were sold to Mazhavil Manorama for 6.5 million, which was the highest price ever paid for a Telugu film dubbed in Malayalam. The Indian DVD and Blu ray were marketed by Aditya Videos, and were released in June 2014. Yevadu was also dubbed in Hindi and released in 2015 by Goldmines Telefilms. The television rights for the Hindi version were sold to SET Max . According to International Business Times India, the film received decent feedback from critics. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu felt that the film was made only for the mass audience. She criticised the film's revenge sequences, calling them non stop and prolonged but praised Devi Sri Prasad's music and C. Ram Prasad's cinematography. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, For those watching Yevadu, the first half ends quite shockingly as the director tries to wrap up the movie in the first leg itself. It is a treat for Cherry's fans and for others, it's strictly average stuff . He felt that the violence, lack of comedy and a predictable turn of events affected the film's narration. IndiaGlitz rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, Yevadu has not one but two revenge stories. The first revenge story has not much going for it perhaps the director deemed it fit not to take it seriously. Followed by this no brainer, there comes the film's actual story, giving us respite and much needed entertainment in good measure . Sify also rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, Yevadu provides novelty in the beginning episodes promising a different commercial film but ends up as a regular revenge drama. Has many cliched moments but it is also a film that works to some extent. A masala fare . Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India was yet another to rate the film 3 out of 5, but he criticised its blatant similarities to Face Off. He added that the action choreography was undecipherable and called Sai Kumar's character as one of the most over the top villain characters ever adding that he would certainly break the outer limit of human hearing threshold . Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment rated the film 3 out of 5 as well, stating, Yevadu is a good action entertainer with all commercial ingredients. Ram Charan Teja is the showman in the film. If you are looking for entertainment without any message, it is good treat for you this Sankrathi . The film became the biggest opener for Ram Charan by collecting 86.5 million on its first day, making the film with the fourth highest opening day grosses of all time, surpassing 1 Nenokkadine. While the film's trade witnessed a drop on its second day, earning 40 million, it improved on its third day, earning 45 million, bringing its three day total to 173.8 million, overtaking the totals of 1 Nenokkadine and Ramayya Vasthavayya 2013 . The film collected a distributor share of 200 million in four days at AP Box office. The film collected 278.5 million in six days, surpassing the first week share of Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, and was expected to surpass its first week worldwide share of 335 million. The film also established a first week record in Nellore, and the east and west areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, by collecting 16.3 million, 26.7 million, 22.2 million and 40.6 million, respectively. However, it missed a first week record in Ceded and Visakhapatnam by a small margin. It also took the second spot in the list of the top 10 films with highest first week shares from AP. The film collected 337.5 million in 9 days, and more than 60 million from other areas, including Karnataka, the rest of India, and overseas territories, enabling it to cross the 400 million mark at the worldwide Box office, becoming Ram Charan's fourth film to cross that mark.

"Yi Jianlian simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin Yi Jianlian born October 27, 1984 is a Chinese professional basketball player for the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association CBA . He has also played in the National Basketball Association NBA for the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks. Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 200203 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. In the 2007 NBA draft, he was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick. Initially, Yi declined to sign with Milwaukee for several months before agreeing to a contract with them on 29 August 2007. He later played for three other NBA teams until returning to the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2012. Yi also plays for the Chinese national team, having represented his country at the Olympics in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, as well as the 2006 and 2010 FIBA World Championships. Yi played in the 2004 Olympics at age 16 and remains the youngest man to play Olympic basketball since 1948. As a child, Yi's parents did not allow him to join a sports school, which is designed for children predicted to be future professional athletes. However, a sports school's basketball coach who noticed Yi's potential in playing street basketball persuaded Yi's family to allow him to train professionally. Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal, Adidas invited him to attend the company's ABCD Camp in New Jersey in 2002, where he competed against all American high school players. After returning to China later that year, he signed a professional contract with Chinese Basketball Association side Guangdong Southern Tigers and averaged 3.5 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in his first season. He also averaged 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in four games during the playoffs, and won the Rookie of the Year award. Yi was featured in TIME's August 2003 article titled The Next Yao Ming . In each of his next three seasons, Yi led Guangdong to the CBA championship and he was awarded the CBA finals' most valuable player honor in 2006. In Yi's final season in the Chinese Basketball Association before he entered the 2007 NBA draft, he averaged a career high 24.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game, but his team lost to the Bayi Rockets in the playoff finals. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Yi signed a one year contract to return to the Guangdong Southern Tigers. Unlike most NBA players who went to the Chinese Basketball Association during that time, he received an option to return to the NBA once the lockout had been resolved. After the lockout ended, he signed with the Dallas Mavericks for the remainder of the 201112 season. Yi re joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 201213 CBA season and went on to win a fourth championship that season. In October 2016, Yi returned to Guangdong after spending training camp with the Los Angeles Lakers. Yi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience. Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft. Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016. After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi year rookie contract. Yi was named to Milwaukee's starting lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 200708 season. He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 7872 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi's first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Yao Ming praised Yi's play in his first few games, saying, If you compare us in our third NBA games, you will see that Yi's statistics are far better than mine. On 9 November 2007, Yi played against Yao for the first time when the Houston Rockets hosted Milwaukee in a 10488 loss. Yi recorded 19 points and nine rebounds, including two three pointers, while Yao recorded 28 points and nine rebounds. The game between the two was watched by over 200 million people in China, making it one of the most watched games in NBA history. After the game, Yao called Yi's talent unbelievable and Tracy McGrady said that Yi had a tremendous upside in this league . Del Harris, the former head coach of the Chinese national basketball team, also described Yi as the most athletic 7 footer in the NBA. Yi was named the NBA Rookie of the Month for December 2007 after averaging 12.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game that month, while scoring a career high 29 points on 14 of 17 shooting in a win over the Charlotte Bobcats on December 22. On 30 January 2008, he was selected for the rookie team in the Rookie Challenge at the 2008 NBA All Star Game. On 2 February 2008, Yi faced Yao for the second time when Milwaukee played at home against Houston, which Krystkowiak dubbed the Chinese Super Bowl. However, both players struggled during Houston's 9183 victory over Milwaukee. Yao scored 12 points while Yi injured his shoulder during the game, finishing with just six points. On 2 April 2008, it was announced that Yi would miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Having already missed eight games with other injuries, Yi managed 66 out of a possible 82 games in his rookie season, averaging 8.6 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. One of Milwaukee's assistant coaches, Brian James, later said that the injuries he had bothered him more than people realized, and he couldn't play through them. On 26 June 2008, Yi was traded by the Milwaukee Bucks along with Bobby Simmons to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Richard Jefferson. New Jersey's team president Rod Thorn said that we feel strongly he's going to be a real good player, and the team's chief executive Brett Yormark said it opens up a truly new fan base for us. Yi stated that he didn't expect to be traded, but that it was an honor to join the Nets. Through his first 37 games with New Jersey, Yi averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 39 from behind the three point line, which was well above his average from the previous season. But on 9 January 2009, Yi broke the little finger on his right hand and was expected to miss four to six weeks. Thorn called it lousy timing because he'd been playing well, but Yi said I'll just take my time. I'll come back. In voting for the 2009 NBA All Star Game, Yi finished third in total votes for forwards in the Eastern Conference, ahead of players such as Paul Pierce and Chris Bosh. Yi made his return from injury after the 2009 NBA All Star Game in a loss to the Houston Rockets on 17 February 2009. However, after averaging only six points on 36 shooting after his return, Yi was removed from the team's starting lineup. His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38 shooting percentage from the field and 34 on three point field goals. After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs, Yi's agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and said it begs the question ...who's accountable New Jersey's head coach Lawrence Frank said that you have to be patient. He's only 21 , and Yi assessed his season by saying he was still too much up and down. In the 200910 season, Yi returned to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a laceration on his upper lip on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, as well as a 40 shooting percentage from the field and 37 on three point field goals. On 29 June 2010, Yi was traded to the Washington Wizards along with 3 million in cash considerations for Quinton Ross. Yi ended the 201011 season averaging 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. Washington had until 30 June 2011 to extend Yi's contract but decided not to. On 6 January 2012, Yi signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a one year contract after starting the season with the Guangdong Southern Tigers. He was immediately assigned to Dallas' D League affiliate team, the Texas Legends. Yi benefited from the new collective bargaining agreement rules which allowed players with more than two years of NBA experience to be assigned to the D League with the players' consent. On 9 January 2012, after playing two games for the Texas Legends, averaging 23 points and 12 rebounds per game, he was recalled by Dallas. The team faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the playoffs and in Game 3 of the playoff series, Yi played in his first NBA playoffs game, where he scored two points for the team in five minutes. On August 22, 2016, Yi signed a one year, 8 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the NBA for the first time since 2012. Lakers head coach Luke Walton considered Yi to be the team's best shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much of a role. Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. Feeling he would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season. The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016. Yi's first major international experience came at the 2003 FIBA Under 19 World Championship in which he averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. He made his debut with the Chinese national basketball team during the 2004 Summer Olympics and averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds per game at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. His performance impressed coaches on the Chinese national team as well as the coaches from other countries. In 2008, Yi was once again selected to play for the Chinese national team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In China's first two group stage matches, Yi scored 9 and 4 points respectively, and China lost both their games against the United States and Spain. But in a win against Angola, Yi recorded a double double, and in a win against Germany, Yi recorded 9 points and 11 rebounds, and hit the crucial shot with 28 seconds left to help China advance to the quarter finals. However, Lithuania ended China's run by beating them 9468, as Yi scored 11 points for his side. Yi, along with former NBA player Sun Yue, was a member of the Chinese national team that played at the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship and the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. Yi was named the most valuable player of the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship, averaging 16.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. Yi also played for the Chinese national team during the 2012 Summer Olympics, ranking first in rebounds per game with 10.2 per game and ranking second in blocks with 2.2 per game.

Yi is fluent in both Mandarin and his native tongue of Cantonese. He was ranked fourth on Forbes' China Celebrity 100 in income and popularity in 2008. In 2008, Yi donated 100,000 yuan to support the 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims and also participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics' torch relay by carrying the torch during the Hainan leg of the relay. In 2004, Yi was listed as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese officials said that it was probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age. In 2007 and 2008, Yi's date of birth was further scrutinized as being 27 October 1984, including a Chinese reporter discovering a high school enrollment form from 1997 that listed Yi as being born on 27 October 1984.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi%20Jianlian
"Yield is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on February 3, 1998. Following a short promotional tour for its previous album, No Code 1996 , Pearl Jam recorded Yield throughout 1997 at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The album was hailed as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound, and marked a more collaborative effort from the band as opposed to relying heavily on frontman Eddie Vedder to compose the song lyrics. The lyrics deal with contemplative themes, albeit seen in a more positive manner compared to the band's earlier work. Yield received positive reviews and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. While like No Code, the album soon began dropping down the charts, Yield eventually outsold its predecessor. The band did more promotion for the album compared to No Code, including a return to full scale touring and the release of a music video for the song Do the Evolution. The record has been certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States. The album is Pearl Jam's last release with drummer Jack Irons, who left the band during the album's promotional tour. For its fifth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O'Brien, whom the band had worked with on its previous three records. Yield was recorded throughout 1997 in Seattle, Washington at Studio X and Studio Litho, the latter of which is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album would be the last collaboration with O'Brien for several years, until he was brought on board in 2008 to remix the band's debut album Ten and produce 2009's Backspacer. Compared with Vitalogy and No Code, Yield represented more of a team effort among all members of the group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for Vitalogy and No Code however, at the end of the No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that everybody took that to heart, and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept everybody energized about their place in the band. Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ... We talk more now, and hang out ... He seems very, very centered now. Vedder said that the band was able to team up and have a partnership while the album was being recorded. The band spent a large amount of time rehearsing the songs to get the best takes possible. Gossard commented that there was more contouring and honing of demo material than on previous records. Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, We didn't put any time limit on it. It was like, 'When this record's done, we call it a record.' We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it. Ament stated that Yield was a superfun record to make. And so much of it was Ed kind of sitting back. He added that everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band. The band discussed the album's production on the documentary Single Video Theory. Overall, Yield resembles the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work. Gossard said The songs were a little bit more structured. I don't know if it was poppier, but it seemed more professional. O'Brien noted that during the Yield sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten. Given to Fly, the album's first single, was noted for its similarity to Led Zeppelin's Going to California from the 1971 album, Led Zeppelin IV. Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code. Vedder said that while in the past we got really angry and we cried out against many things in our songs, he considered that when you become an adult you have to express your energy in a different way, more calm. This led to songs that, while not eschewing the bad side of life, ended up facing it from a more positive point of view, looking for a way to solve it. In the past we said what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it's time to say stop, let's look for a solution, let's be positive. Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita Pilate , Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael Do the Evolution , and the writings of Charles Bukowski In Hiding . Gossard wrote the lyrics for the songs No Way and All Those Yesterdays, and Ament, making his first lyrical contributions to a Pearl Jam album, wrote the lyrics for Pilate and Low Light. Ament said, watch Eddie put his heart into singing lyrics that I wrote was an experience I can't put into words. Gossard said No Way expresses the idea that people just need to live and quit trying to prove something. According to Vedder, Given to Fly is about rising above anybody's comments about what you do and still giving your love away, Do the Evolution is about someone who's drunk with technology, who thinks they're the controlling living being on this planet, MFC takes place in a car and is about getting the fuck out of a problem, and In Hiding is about taking a fast from life. Ament said that Pilate concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while Low Light was the answer, and that it deals with a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be. The album's cover art shows an empty road underneath a bright blue sky with a yield sign on the right hand side of the road. The front cover art image was taken from a photograph of Montana Highway 200 between Lincoln and Great Falls, Montana, while the inside cover depicts the yield sign in the middle of the ocean. The cover of the cassette version mirrored the image. A yield sign is hidden in every picture of the liner notes booklet. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, Yield received a nomination for Best Recording Package. Ament said that the cover came from the idea on how cool to have a yield sign where there's nothing to yield to , and the place was a road on the way to his Montana home which he considered perfect for the photo. The album title is rooted in the idea of yielding to nature, a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more comfortable within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me yielding, letting something else happen and going with it. Vedder said, Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, and then you have to think, 'What are the real battles ' 'What's really important ' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you. The indie rock band BOAT parodied the album's cover art, among several others, on its 2011 release Dress Like Your Idols. Yield was released on February 3, 1998, on CD, vinyl, cassette and MiniDisc. Epic promoted the album more than No Code, with marketing vice president Steve Barnett claiming it was the first time since debut album Ten that the label had the lead time to do the job right. The album leaked on the internet in December 1997 as Syracuse, New York radio station WKRL FM played an advance copy of the record, leading fans who taped the broadcast to release the tracks online. Two singles were released from Yield. The lead single Given to Fly entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 21, reached number three on the Modern Rock charts, and spent a total of six weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album's other commercially released single, Wishlist , charted on the Hot 100 at number 47. Album tracks In Hiding and Do the Evolution also charted on the rock charts. The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for Do the Evolution . It was the band's first music video since 1992. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, Do the Evolution received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance and its music video received a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form. Yield sold 358,000 copies during its first week of release, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 album chart. It was held off the top spot by the Titanic soundtrack. Yield became Pearl Jam's first album not to peak at number one on the Billboard charts since Ten in 1991. However, Yield has been certified platinum by the RIAA, and eventually outsold its predecessor No Code with 1.9 million copies in the United States as of 2013 according to Nielsen SoundScan. Yield received mixed to positive reviews from music critics but being proclaimed as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Rolling Stone staff writer Rob Sheffield gave Yield four out of five stars, saying that before, the band's best songs were the change of pace ballads...Yield marks the first time Pearl Jam have managed to sustain that mood for a whole album. He added that Vedder is singing more frankly than ever about his life as an adult, and that the album shows that Pearl Jam have made the most out of growing up in public. Spin gave the album eight out of ten stars. The review said that Pearl Jam have come back with an album full of gracefully ambivalent anthems. All commodities should be this unstable, and have this much blood pumping through them. In his review for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A , saying, Like nobody less than Nirvana...they voice the arena rock agon more vulnerably and articulately than any Englishman standing. Rarely if ever has a Jesus complex seemed so modest. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the band applies its introspection to spiritual possibilities and its guitars to chomping, snarling, exuberant riffs. He said the songs sound bolder and more confident, even when they invoke private crises. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that the overall tone is less pretentious than in the past, reflecting a looser, even marginally whimsical, worldview. Holly Bailey of Pitchfork called it the most lyrically powerful album Pearl Jam have ever produced, and stated that Yield proves that Pearl Jam, and even rock music, is still alive and kicking. NME gave Yield a score of seven out of ten. In the review, it is stated, Here's where Pearl Jam put on their diverse boots and stomp across their bluesy roots, careering through various styles and pop mongous strops. However, AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album two and a half out of five stars, saying that it emphasizes the relative lack of exceptional material. Writing for Select in March 1998, Eddy Lawrence concluded that Yield is an abandonment of the anthemic qualities present in Pearl Jam's previous work, claiming, in relation to the band's grunge roots, that the album makes you realise how '60s fans felt watching the first generation of rock heroes die. He went on to state that Yield's retroisms represent no leap forward for the band as a whole, and the oft times mildly diverting tunes are, ironically, less challenging than their strong willed early output. Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both were met with financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him. He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer ' Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band. Pearl Jam's summer tour of North America marked the band's return to full scale touring and the use of Ticketmaster, to which the band had previously protested. Pearl Jam once again began using it in order to better accommodate concertgoers. The band still kept Ticketmaster venues at a minimum, stadiums in particular as manager Kelly Curtis joked that unlike U2, the band doesn't have a lemon . The first leg of the tour focused on the West Coast of the United States and the Midwest, and then the band moved to the East Coast for the tour's second leg. and after it was completed the band released its first live album, Live on Two Legs, which featured select performances from the tour. McCready stated that the band released the live album due to the strength of Pearl Jam's shows on the tour. On October 20, 2014, at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee, during the Lightning Bolt Tour, Pearl Jam played the entire album in order as part of their set. All lyrics are written by Eddie Vedder, except where noted. I Contains a sample of Happy When I'm Crying , a song written by Irons and released on Pearl Jam's 1997 fan club Christmas single. II All Those Yesterdays contains the hidden track Hummus at 5 04. The album's singles featured two B sides from the Yield recording sessions that were not included on the album Leatherman , about the eponymous 19th century vagabond was a B side on the Given to Fly single, and U was featured on the Wishlist single, being later re recorded for the 2003 Lost Dogs collection of rarities. Whale Song , sung by Irons, was also recorded during the Yield sessions and was eventually included on the 1999 Music for Our Mother Ocean, Vol. 3 compilation as well as Lost Dogs. Happy When I'm Crying was recorded around this time and was released on the band's 1997 fan club Christmas single.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield%20%28album%29

"Yo English I or Me is the sixth studio album by Romanian singer Inna, released on 31 May 2019 by Global Records and Roc Nation. Inna began work on the record in 2016 inspired by a recent trip to Latin America, she decided the album would feature only Spanish language material. Inna contributed significantly to the songwriting process of Yo, and collaborated extensively with Romanian producer David Ciente on its songs. An experimental and heavily gypsy music influenced effort, Yo marks the first time Inna took control over an album's creative process it acts as a departure from her past EDM releases. Lyrically, Inna sings about love, and presents several female characters seen from different perspectives throughout the album. Upon its release, music critics received Yo with positive reviews, commending its experimental nature and the resulting expansion of Inna's artistry. To promote the album, five singles were released from September 2018 to May 2019 Ra , Iguana , Sin Ti , Tu Manera and Te Vas . Of these, Iguana experienced commercial success in Romania, peaking at number four on the country's Airplay 100 chart. In addition, Inna made several public appearances in the United States and Mexico to promote Ra , such as the 2018 Telehit Awards and 19th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, alongside promotion through Inna's inclusion in magazines such as Rolling Stone and Vogue Mexico y Latinoamerica. A music video directed by Bogdan Paun was filmed for each of the album's tracks, which feature the singer embodying different women as part of independent storylines. Inna began work on Yo in 2016, and around 50 songs were composed from which to select the album's final tracklist. After her first official tour in Canada and the United States in SeptemberOctober 2018, Inna uploaded a short film on her YouTube channel on 16 Octoberher birthdaytitled Yo . In it, she teased the album by briefly elaborating on its creation. In an interview, Inna revealed the release date for Yo to be late 2018, saying that she was working on adjustments. Inna also signed a record deal with Roc Nation. The singer subsequently announced the record's release date as 31 May 2019, which would be conducted by Global Records and Roc Nation. She further unveiled its cover artwork on her Instagram. It shows the singer nude with a freshly chopped fringe bob in front of a floral collage and handwritten lyrics of some of the songs from Yo. On the day of release, Inna also launched the website yosoyinna.com to accompany the album's release and organized a release party in Bucharest, inviting fellow Romanian celebrities. Inna envisioned Yo to be completely in Spanish, a language she had learnt by watching telenovelas, due to the vibe that she had gotten during a recent trip to Latin America. She remembers I was in the studio, ... listening to some instrumentals ... , I started with some lines and then, it turned out really easy to write the lyrics in Spanish . She further stated I never had a plan for it, we tried it in English but the music did not work that well. The singer took entire creative control over the album, which is why she chose the title Yo, referring only to herself, and contributed significantly to the songwriting. She elaborated on the songwriting process We write in gibberish, it could be any language. The base of the song is la la las or words with no meaning. Then we find the right words later. Inna described the songs on Yo as experimental and heavily influenced by gypsy music, a change in style from her previous EDM releases. She saw her change in direction to an ecletic and unclassifiable genre as an artistic necessity that assaulted her in the studio . Throughout the album, she also explores several singing styles, including vocal inflections influenced by Romanian folklore. The lyrics are written from the perspectives of several female characters. Each song delves into experiences Inna thinks she has lived in another life . For Yo, Inna collaborated extensively with Romanian producer David Ciente, who added natural and homemade sounds to the songs' instrumentation according to Inna, he has made out of everything from wood, metal, traffic sounds a beat on the microphone . Valentin Mafroy of the music website Aficia views Yo as a concept album. Various publications reported that the majority of its songs delved into the theme of love and empowerment. Some tracks address other themes such as Si, Mama regarding Inna's mother's advice about fame and false friends, as well as the optimistic La Vida which talks about karma, and Locura , delving on liberty in a relationship. Yo shows Inna's songwriting in a variety of genres, including house Te Vas , and dance and pop Tu Manera . Several songs use traditional Spanish genres or mix them with mainstream ones, such as Iguana club and salsa , Sin Ti dembow , and Gitana flamenco and electronic music . Contigo samples Inna's Nirvana 2017 , and the closing Fuego features the singer rapping throughout. Music critics received Yo with positive reviews, with Paloma Diaz Espineira of Los 40 praising the album's experimental and risky nature, citing Tu Manera and Gitana as highlights. The staff of Cosmopolitan saw Iguana as the best song on the album, but said that all of its tracks had a unique melody , the Inna touch , and were impossible to listen to without dancing . CelebMix's Jonathan Currinn echoed the sentiment, although criticizing the order of the songs on the tracklist. He wrote is another brilliant collection of tracks ... . Inna's new direction, for this era, suits her well and adds to her international star quality . Eleven videosone for each of the song on Yowere directed by Bogdan Paun, while production was handled by Loops Production Alexandru Muresan was hired as the director of photography.

Although his last album, Muy Dentro de Mi Corazon, was a success, Fernandez did not want to simply record another ranchera album. If I had released another album of just rancheras, people would have just expected the same thing, and then they would have begun to judge me by that one theme , Fernandez explained. He also noted bolero's popularity on radio stations and cited his waning radio airplay. After listening to Mi Tierra by Gloria Estefan, Fernandez sought Estefan's husband Emilio Estefan to have him produced Fernandez's next album.

"Yo Yo is a song by British recording artist Nicola Roberts, released as the third and final single from Roberts' debut solo album Cinderella's Eyes on 6 January 2012. Originally, Yo Yo was set to be Roberts' debut single, but Beat of My Drum was selected in its place. Beat of My Drum and Lucky Day , Roberts' previous singles, garnered positive comments from critics, but failed to impact commercially. Yo Yo was written by Roberts, Maya Von Doll and Dimitri Tikovoi while it was produced by latter, and was the first song to be composed by the group. Roberts also claimed the track had defined her musical style. Yo Yo is a 1950s themed electropop and synth pop song in which Roberts sings about an undecided lover. The song received positive reviews from critics, who compared Roberts' vocals to those of singer Kate Bush. Commercially, it was a failure, charting at number 111 on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was released on 30 November 2011 the video sees Roberts repeatedly changing outfit for a party in which she finds her love interest cheating on her, ending with an aggressive confrontation. It garnered positive critical responses although the low budget drew criticism. Roberts performed Yo Yo at London's G A Y nightclub and on the Alan Titchmarsh Show, among other occasions. Roberts explaining the lyrics and concept of the track. Nicola Roberts, who began her musical career as one fifth of the band Girls Aloud, struggled with loneliness and increasing isolation during her time with the group. A busy schedule and constant media criticism found her describing the time as a blur . Her exhaustion and troubles with negative media comments led to a state in which she had to harden herself, claiming that inside she was dying . These events inspired her debut album Cinderella's Eyes. Yo Yo was the first song she had written with Maya von Doll and Dimitri Tikovoi for the album. The recording was also one of the first songs Roberts wrote, and it helped define her musical style. Roberts blogged about the production of the track, writing that The productions incredible. The beat is just so constant and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like Id found my sound. And I was kind of looking at it like an outfit. So it was, if this was an outfit, what would this song need now So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. But what do we need to really set this song off A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off. So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy hands in the air. Roberts' debut single, Beat of My Drum , garnered acclaim from critics, but failed to impact commercially, charting at 27 in the United Kingdom. She released a follow up single, Lucky Day , which likewise garnered positive responses, but was even less successful commercially, charting at number 40 on both the Scottish and UK Singles charts. Writing as a guest blogger on the website Holy Moly in September 2011, Roberts announced that Yo Yo would be released as the third single from Cinderella's Eyes, initially citing a November release date the release was later delayed until January 2012. Roberts had originally intended for Yo Yo to be the first single from the album, but Beat of My Drum was instead chosen at the last minute . Roberts stated that it felt right to go with the latter song. Yo Yo was released digitally on 2 January 2012, with Roberts announcing on her official website that the single would be released in CD format featuring a live performance of the song in addition to the demo version of her song Sticks Stones seven days later. Additionally, two EPs were released on 6 January 2012. Yo Yo features 808 drums with a dramatic 1950s inspired pop pastiche . However, the 1950s concept goes completely out of the window for an unhinged bridge, which features a club mix which speeds up the drums featured in the song. The lyrics of the track discuss an uncertain relationship, leading to vulnerability, with Roberts describing it as a dark song. The song references a yo yo this is a metaphor for Roberts herself, a spinning yo yo on the finger of a hot 'n' cold lover . Described as confessional by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy, the song has a conversational performance, and Roberts' vocals were compared to that of singer Kate Bush. The song received positive reviews from music critics. Emily Mackay, writing for NME, described the chorus as a winning one, and noted that the impulse speed space synths are broken heartedly beguiling . In a separate review, Lisa Wright from NME found that while the song didn't match the success of Beat of My Drum . Wright said that the song is Not a cuss ridden introduction to Nicolas re emergence as an English Syd Tha Kyd, but a questionable metaphor about being like a crap 90s toy. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy found Cinderella's Eyes to be frustratingly under appreciated with Yo Yo being a shining example of Roberts' pop sensibilities calling it unashamedly radio friendly . The video begins with a man performing tricks with a yo yo in a white room, accompanied by shots showing Roberts in a fashionable looking house wearing a black silk dress. Then rapid shots show her in various other outfits, including a purple velvet dress, all the time showing the man performing tricks with the yo yo. As the chorus begins, Roberts is shown in the kitchen of the house, along with several women dancing with her. Another shot shows a man and a woman walking through a street embracing each other. This is later interspersed with shots of a fully clothed Roberts standing in a shower cubiclem getting increasingly wet. Roberts is shown leaving the house and seeing the man with whom she had danced with another woman. She returns to the house, and the man and Roberts are seen in the kitchen area with Roberts throwing a series of objects at him. Roberts discussing the concept of the video. Prior to the release of the video, Roberts released still images to website 3am. These showed her in what was described as some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house , while one showed her with her legs above her head wearing Kandee's caramel kisses shoes and a third and final seeing her cosying up next to a handsome chap . The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was playing with a pair of shoes . The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos for Beat of My Drum and Lucky Day , saying that it looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower. Mendoza found that Roberts was becoming quite the chameleon and had trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren , referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. She interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting t works because of the lyrics what, besides other people, can mess with your feelings more than trying on clothes Roberts performed Yo Yo at London's G A Y nightclub on 24 September 2011. She pre recorded a performance of Yo Yo for UK television programme The Alan Titchmarsh Show during the same taping as a performance of Lucky Day . The taping came after deciding Yo Yo would be released as the third single from the album, with Roberts saying, I absolutely love performing Yo Yo, it's my favourite one to do ... So I feel really close to Yo Yo. I feel like I lose myself when I'm performing it . After the release of the single, Roberts performed on The Album Chart Show during a special dedicated to her, performing three tracks Yo Yo , Beat of My Drum and Sticks Stones . Roberts also performed the song on British chat show Loose Women and on the Digital Music Awards. Yo Yo debuted at its peak of number 111 on the UK Singles Chart.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo%20%28Nicola%20Roberts%20song%29
"Yoda is a song by Weird Al Yankovic from his third album, Dare to Be Stupid 1985 . It is a parody of the song Lola by the Kinks. Inspired by the events of the movie The Empire Strikes Back, the song is told from the point of view of Jedi in training Luke Skywalker, and concerns his dealings with Master Yoda on the planet Dagobah. The song was initially written and recorded in 1980, during the original release of The Empire Strikes Back, and achieved success on The Dr. Demento Show however, securing permission from both Star Wars creator George Lucas and Lola songwriter Ray Davies delayed the physical release of the song for about five years. Yoda was never released as a single, and no music video was ever made for it. Nevertheless, the parody has gone on to be one of Yankovic's most famous songs. It was re released twice in 1994 on his second greatest hits set and the box set Permanent Record, and also on the 2009 compilation The Essential Weird Al Yankovic. The song is also a staple during Yankovic's live shows, and an idiosyncratic chant dubbed The Yoda Chant is often performed during the song's middle portions. Yoda was originally written by Weird Al Yankovic in 1980 when the epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back was playing in theaters. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke in the ways of the Force following the demise of Obi Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda had never occurred to me. He considered writing a song based on the break out character , but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use Lola which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan. Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a 4 track cassette Portastudio. This version of Yoda was a success on The Dr. Demento Show, and peaked at number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes. Yankovic wanted to include the song on one of his albums, since the demo version had been so popular. However, securing permission from both George Lucas and the Kinks delayed the physical release of the song for about five years. Although Lucas eventually gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Yankovic down. Yoda might have remained unreleased had it not been for a chance encounter between Yankovic and Ray Davies, who wrote Lola . When Yankovic asked him why he had not given his permission, Davies responded that he had never been asked. Davies ultimately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Yankovic's third album Dare to Be Stupid. For subsequent parodies, Yankovic has attempted to approach the songwriters themselves for permission rather than their publishers whenever possible. Yoda was re recorded on February 20, 1985. This version of the song does not feature the use of an accordion and is truer, musically, to the original Kinks song. Yankovic later said, It's kind of a backlash from the first album, where we had accordion on everything. It just became a little overwhelming to me. After Dare to Be Stupid was released, Yankovic considered Yoda a cool album track rather than a potential single due to the age of both The Empire Strikes Back and the original song. This, and the fact that the majority of the album's video budget went to the then current Like a Virgin parody, meant that a Yoda video would not be feasible. Nevertheless, the song has gone on to be one of Yankovic's most famous parodies and a fan favorite. The song was featured on the Greatest Hits Volume II 1994 , the box set Permanent Record 1994 , and the 2009 compilation The Essential Weird Al Yankovic. The song appeared on The Time Machine episode of The Weird Al Show, and on the compilation album Radio Disney Kid Jams. Yoda has been played at the end of every show for the tours promoting Yankovic's albums Dare to Be Stupid, Off The Deep End, Alapalooza, Bad Hair Day, Running with Scissors, Poodle Hat, Alpocalypse, and Mandatory Fun. Starting with the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, the song has been preceded by that album's Star Warsthemed single, The Saga Begins . For the Straight Outta Lynwood tour, the band moved both songs to the middle of the set, and performed Albuquerque as their finale. Beginning in June 2010, Yoda has again been the final encore. Unlike the album version of Yoda , which uses the same instrumentation as Lola , Yankovic will often add accordion accompaniment in live performances this can be seen on the video releases Weird Al Yankovic Live and Weird Al Yankovic Live The Alpocalypse Tour. Since 1991, an a cappella chant often referred to as the Yoda chant has been included in live performances, and is considered a staple of Yankovic's shows. Midway through Yoda , the band slowly ceases playing and goes into the chant, which Yankovic wrote himself. Originally, the chant consisted mainly of mnemonic syllables accompanied by synchronized movements from the band. Over the years, the chant has grown to include, among other things, pieces from Grim Grinning Ghosts the theme to Disneyland attraction The Haunted Mansion , phrases from The Trashmen's Surfin' Bird and Frere Jacques , and elements of the Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi chant. On the Mandatory Fun Tour in 2015, a piece of the four way crimp from The Mighty Boosh was also added. In 2015, as part of Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars , a benefit for New York Collaborates for Autism, Yankovic performed the song with 13 year old Jodi DiPiazza, a noted pianist with autism.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda%20%28song%29

In order to promote and support Yodel It , the singers made various appearances to perform the song, including at the 2017 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships, as well as in London, Madrid, Amsterdam and Tel Aviv. An accompanying music video was filmed by Dan Petcan in Cluj Napoca and was uploaded to YouTube on 21 April 2017.

The track was originally recorded with a solo vocal, but Florea was chosen as a featured vocal artist as Ilinca and Alexandru felt the initial version was incomplete. He received the offer to sing on the track two weeks before the song was to be submitted for the selection of the Romanian song for the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest. It was later revealed that Niculae wrote Yodel It initially for the Swiss band Timebelle, the Swiss representative for Eurovision 2017, and that it was planned to be the song that represented Switzerland in the contest with Ilinca as the band's vocalist. However, the track was rejected by the group in favor of Apollo . Alexandru submitted Yodel It to the Romanian national selection committee although it ha nothing Romanian in it .

Ilinca yodels prominently during the chorus, while Florea provides rap vocals. The song runs at a moderate tempo of 87 beats per minute. Bogdan Honciuc from Wiwibloggs likened its lyrical message to that of Taylor Swift's Shake It Off 2014 , as Ilinca teaches us to break free from the daily doom and gloom, but she suggests yodeling our hearts out instead of shaking it off . The song's instrumental was sent to specialists in Sweden to remaster prior to the duo's appearance at the Eurovision Grand Final in Kiev. Upon its release, Yodel It was met with a mixed response from music critics. Reviewers from Wiwibloggs had both positive and negative opinions of the recording, praising its staging potential, the mixture of multiple genres and the singers' stage presence, but also criticized the yodeling sequences. An editor jokingly wrote, Look, if Switzerland are sending a Romanian band this year, why shouldn't Romania send a yodeller in return Overall, the reviewers on the website gave the song 7.36 out of 10 points. A later review lowered the score to 5.69 out of 10 points. Matei Ruta from EuroVisionary noticed that Yodel It had a mass appealing sound and has the important quality of being an earworm . Critical commentary also likened parts of the song to the sound of the band The Script and will.i.am's Hall of Fame 2012 . The judges of the Selectia Nationala were positive and found that the song had a simple construction and applauded its catchiness. Traian Danciu of Adevarul similarly praised Yodel It and its optimistic message. The track was also predicted to rank highly at Eurovision by a number of international publications, and reached number six in the betting odds before the contest. Eurovision specialist Andrei Faur had a negative opinion of the track, calling it mediocre and unfeeling. He also noted yodeling was not a typical element of Romanian culture.

Later in the video, the ground under her rises to his level, and they sing to each other. Then various people are shown stopping what they are doing, the ground under them also rises to the sky, and they join the duo. The video closes with everyone dancing and having a good time on their respective towers. After its release, the clip amassed 250,000 views in 48 hours which, according to Wiwibloggs, is amazing for a Eurovision video . Honciuc, a writer on the same website, reacted favourably to the music video saying, The visuals highlight the positive message of the song but also the beauty of Cluj Napoca, Ilinca's hometown that serves as a backdrop. ESC Covers's Ian Fowell called it charming .

This order was later changed after Russia's withdrawal from the contest, resulting in Romania performing in fifth place. In an interview with Adevarul in March 2017, the singers stated that the 5,000 they had received after winning the Romanian national selection was fully invested in their live performance at the Eurovision. They also revealed that they were in the process of creating a simple movement to accompany the song's yodeling sequences. Ilinca and Florea's rehearsals in Kiev were scheduled on 2 May and 5 May 2017. Complaints about camera work were lodged, and Florea injured himself after falling off a cannon during the first rehearsal. The concept for the stage showwhich was done in Romania along with the stage graphics in Kiev was revealed during their first rehearsal. Florea thought that the concept reinforced the message of love saying, It's about making love, not war . In an interview, the head of delegation Marciuc stated that the performance would not be accompanied by pyrotechnics as it was impactful enough . The show was directed by Aurel Badea, Sergiu Ardelean was director of photography, and Gabriel Scirlet was the musical director. A scene where Florea jumps out from a cannon was inspired by a similar one from the 1997 movie Life Is Beautiful, representing the end of the war . The show began with a number of large toy soldiers drumming in the background. Colourful imagery was displayed during the rest of the performance, including colourful butterflies, blue clouds, white roses, blue musical notes and images flying all over the place along with the letters YODEL IT in different tones. The singers performed in a yellow circle, with Ilinca wearing an Athena Phillip dress designed by Rodica Puca, and Florea clothing designed by Adina Buzatu. At the end of the performance Florea appeared on a glittery cannon originally planned to shoot colorful objectswhich according to the singer would have represented an explosion of love and happiness followed by a second cannon which was introduced and displayed in the background. Florea's brother provided backing vocals. The concept was praised by EuroVisionary writer Michael Outerson, who called it by far the most colourful stage so far and concluded, It seems to be qualifying based on this performance. William Lee Adams from Wiwibloggs stated that the show really worked ... Oozing happiness at every turn, this was three minutes of feel good fun and predicted Romania would rank highly in the televote. Romania qualified for the Grand Final in sixth place with 174 points on 11 May 2017, ranked 15th by the jury's 26 points, and third by the televote of 148 points. Soon after, the country was scheduled to perform 20th in the final, following Cyprus and preceding Germany. Florea's disastrous attempt to kiss Ilinca at the end of their performance was the subject of controversy and irony on social media due to her wry facial expression. Adam Miller from Daily Express wrote, The 18 year old singer appeared to be mortified when her duet partner came in for the kill, squirming and leaning back to escape Alex's clutches. Ilinca's dress was also deemed too short, with Daily Express writer Helen Daly saying it flaunted her enviable pins and almost revealed more . The country reached seventh place in a field of 26 with 282 points, placed 15th by the jury's 58 points and fifth by the televote of 224 points. Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Romania in the second semi final and Grand Final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows. On the latter occasion, the nation received televoting points from 38 of the total 42 countries.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodel%20It%21
"Yoga jo Sanskrit pronunciation is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term yoga in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga, yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures called asanas. The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre Vedic Indian traditions it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and sramana movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, and gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged sometimes between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra. Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into a posture based physical fitness, stress relief and relaxation technique. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy. The impact of postural yoga on physical and mental health has been a topic of systematic studies, with evidence that regular yoga practice yields benefits for low back pain and stress. On December 1, 2016, yoga was listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage. The Sanskrit noun yoga is derived from the root yuj to attach, join, harness, yoke . The word yoga is cognate with English yoke . The spiritual sense of the word yoga first arises in Epic Sanskrit, in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, with the chief aim of uniting the human spirit with the Divine. The term kriyayoga has a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras 2.1 , designating the practical aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the union with the supreme due to performance of duties in everyday life. According to Panini, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga to yoke or yuj samadhau to concentrate . In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samadhau to concentrate is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology. In accordance with Panini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samadhi concentration . According to Dasgupta, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga to yoke or yuj samadhau to concentrate . Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi may be applied to a man or a woman or yogini a woman . The term yoga has been defined in various ways in the many different Indian philosophical and religious traditions. The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha liberation , although the exact form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated. According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal traditional meanings According to David Gordon White, from the 5th century CE onward, the core principles of yoga were more or less in place, and variations of these principles developed in various forms over time White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of yogi practice , different from practical goals of yoga practice, as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era, in the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools. There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization 33001900 BCE and pre Vedic Eastern states of India, the Vedic period 1500500 BCE , and the sramana movement. According to Gavin Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal. Pre philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500 c. 200 BCE. Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. Yoga may have pre Vedic elements. Some state yoga originated in the Indus Valley Civilization. Marshall, Eliade and other scholars note that the Pashupati seal discovered in an Indus Valley Civilization site depicts a figure in a position resembling an asana used for meditation, Mulabandhasana. This interpretation is considered speculative and uncertain by more recent analysis of Srinivasan and may be a case of projecting later practices into archeological findings . According to Crangle, some researchers have favoured a linear theory, which attempts to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis , just like traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas to be the ultimate source of all spiritual knowledge. Thomas McEvilley favors a composite model where pre Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre Vedic period and its refinement began in the Vedic period. Ascetic practices, concentration and bodily postures described in the Vedas may have been precursors to yoga. According to Geoffrey Samuel, Our best evidence to date suggests that practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early sramana movements Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas , probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. According to Zimmer, Yoga philosophy is reckoned to be part of the non Vedic system, which also includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and Buddhism does not derive from Brahman Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre Aryan upper class of northeastern India being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non Vedic Indian systems. The first use of the root of the word yoga is in hymn 5.81.1 of the Rig Veda, a dedication to the rising Sun god in the morning Savitri , where it has been interpreted as yoke or yogically control . The earliest evidence of Yogis and Yoga tradition is found in the Kesin hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda, states Karel Werner. The Yogis of Vedic times left little evidence of their existence, practices and achievements. And such evidence as has survived in the Vedas is scanty and indirect. Nevertheless, the existence of accomplished Yogis in Vedic times cannot be doubted. The Rigveda, however, does not describe yoga, and there is little evidence as to what the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama consciously regulating breath is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad c. 900 BCE , and the practice of pratyahara concentrating all of one's senses on self is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad c. 800700 BCE . The Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana teaches mantra repetition and control of the breath. Ascetic practices tapas , concentration and bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna sacrifice , might have been precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the kesin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000800 BCE and the Atharvaveda. Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda suggests the presence of an early contemplative tradition. Systematic Yoga concepts begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500200 BCE such as the Early Buddhist texts, the middle Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata. According to Geoffrey Samuel, our best evidence to date suggests that yogic practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early sramana movements Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas , probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. This occurred during what is called the Second Urbanisation period. According to Mallinson and Singleton, these traditions were the first to use psychophysical techniques, mainly known as dhyana and tapas. but later described as yoga, to strive for the goal of liberation moksha, nirvana from samsara the round of rebirth . Werner states, The Buddha was the founder of his system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time. He notes But it is only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the Pali Canon that we can speak about a systematic and comprehensive or even integral school of Yoga practice, which is thus the first and oldest to have been preserved for us in its entirety. The early Buddhist texts describe yogic and meditative practices, some of which the Buddha borrowed from the sramana tradition. The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecari mudra. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini. Some of the major suttas that discuss yogic practice include the Satipatthana sutta Four foundations of mindfulness sutta and the Anapanasati sutta Mindfulness of breathing sutta . The chronology of completion of these yoga related Early Buddhist Texts, however, is unclear, just like ancient Hindu texts. Early known Buddhist sources like the Majjhima Nikaya mention meditation, while the Anguttara Nikaya describes Jhayins meditators that resemble early Hindu descriptions of Muni, Kesins and meditating ascetics, but these meditation practices are not called yoga in these texts. The earliest known specific discussion of yoga in the Buddhist literature, as understood in modern context are from the later Buddhist Yogacara and Theravada schools. A yoga system that predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is difficult to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools. Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Buddhist texts are lost to time. Alexander Wynne observes that formless meditation and elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the oldest Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies prana . Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins nadis are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses. The first known appearance of the word yoga , with the same meaning as the modern term, is in the Katha Upanishad, probably composed between the fifth and third century BCE, where it is defined as the steady control of the senses, which along with cessation of mental activity, leading to a supreme state. Katha Upanishad integrates the monism of early Upanishads with concepts of samkhya and yoga. It defines various levels of existence according to their proximity to the innermost being Atman. Yoga is therefore seen as a process of interiorization or ascent of consciousness. It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga. White states The earliest extant systematic account of yoga and a bridge from the earlier Vedic uses of the term is found in the Hindu Katha Upanisad Ku , a scripture dating from about the third century BCE ... t describes the hierarchy of mind body constituentsthe senses, mind, intellect, etc.that comprise the foundational categories of Samkhya philosophy, whose metaphysical system grounds the yoga of the Yogasutras, Bhagavad Gita, and other texts and schools Ku3.1011 6.78 . The hymns in Book 2 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, another late first millennium BCE text, states a procedure in which the body is held in upright posture, the breath is restrained and mind is meditatively focussed, preferably inside a cave or a place that is simple, plain, of silence or gently flowing water, with no noises nor harsh winds. The Maitrayaniya Upanishad, likely composed in a later century than Katha and Shvetashvatara Upanishads but before Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, mentions sixfold yoga method breath control pranayama , introspective withdrawal of senses pratyahara , meditation dhyana , mind concentration dharana , philosophical inquiry creative reasoning tarka , and absorption intense spiritual union samadhi . In addition to the Yoga discussion in above Principal Upanishads, twenty Yoga Upanishads as well as related texts such as Yoga Vasistha, composed in 1st and 2nd millennium CE, discuss Yoga methods. Alexander the Great reached India in the 4th century BCE. Along with his army, he took Greek academics with him who later wrote memoirs about geography, people and customs they saw. One of Alexander's companion was Onesicritus, quoted in Book 15, Sections 6365 by Strabo, who describes yogins of India. Onesicritus claims those Indian yogins Mandanis practiced aloofness and different postures standing or sitting or lying naked and motionless . Onesicritus also mentions his colleague Calanus trying to meet them, who is initially denied audience, but later invited because he was sent by a king curious of wisdom and philosophy . Onesicritus and Calanus learn that the yogins consider the best doctrine of life as rid the spirit of not only pain, but also pleasure , that man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened , that there is no shame in life on frugal fare , and that the best place to inhabit is one with scantiest equipment or outfit . These principles are significant to the history of spiritual side of yoga. These may reflect the ancient roots of undisturbed calmness and mindfulness through balance in later works of Hindu Patanjali and Buddhist Buddhaghosa respectively, states Charles Rockwell Lanman as well as the principle of Aparigraha non possessiveness, non craving, simple living and asceticism discussed in later Hinduism and Jainism. Description of an early form of yoga called nirodhayoga yoga of cessation is contained in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata third century BCE . Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha Self is realized. Terms like vichara subtle reflection , viveka discrimination and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation. Mahabharata defines the purpose of yoga as the experience of uniting the individual atman with the universal Brahman that pervades all things. The Bhagavad Gita 'Song of the Lord' is part of the Mahabharata and also contains extensive teachings on Yoga. According to Mallinson and Singleton, the Gita seeks to appropriate yoga from the renunciate milieu in which it originated, teaching that it is compatible with worldly activity carried out according to one's caste and life stage it is only the fruits of one's actions that are to be renounced. In addition to an entire chapter ch. 6 dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation, it introduces three prominent types of yoga The Gita consists of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas verses , with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus delineating eighteen different yogas. Some scholars divide the Gita into three sections, with the first six chapters with 280 shlokas dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga, and the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga however, this is rough because elements of karma, bhakti and jnana are found in all chapters. Yoga is discussed in the ancient foundational Sutras of Hindu philosophy. The Vaisesika Sutra of the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, dated to have been composed sometime between 6th and 2nd century BCE discusses Yoga. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, an Indologist known for his studies on early Buddhism and Hinduism and a professor at the University of Lausanne, Vaisesika Sutra describes Yoga as a state where the mind resides only in the soul and therefore not in the senses . This is equivalent to pratyahara or withdrawal of the senses, and the ancient Sutra asserts that this leads to an absence of sukha happiness and dukkha suffering , then describes additional yogic meditation steps in the journey towards the state of spiritual liberation. Similarly, Brahma sutras the foundational text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, discusses yoga in its sutra 2.1.3, 2.1.223 and others. Brahma sutras are estimated to have been complete in the surviving form sometime between 450 BCE to 200 CE, and its sutras assert that yoga is a means to gain subtlety of body and other powers. The Nyaya sutras the foundational text of the Nyaya school, variously estimated to have been composed between the 6th century BCE and 2nd century CE, discusses yoga in sutras 4.2.3850. This ancient text of the Nyaya school includes a discussion of yogic ethics, dhyana meditation , samadhi, and among other things remarks that debate and philosophy is a form of yoga. During the period between the Mauryan and the Gupta eras c. 200 BCE500 CE the Indic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and coherent systems of yoga began to emerge. This period witnessed many new texts from these traditions discussing and systematically compiling yoga methods and practices. Some key works of this era include the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the Yoga Yajnavalkya, the Yogacarabhumi Sastra and the Visuddhimagga. One of the best known early expressions of Brahmanical Yoga thought is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali , the original name of which may have been the Patanjalayogasastra samkhya pravacana c. sometime between 325 425 which some scholars now believe included both the sutras and a commentary. As the name suggests, the metaphysical basis for this text is the Indian philosophy termed Samkhya. This atheistic school is mentioned in Kautilya's Arthashastra as one of the three categories of anviksikis philosophies along with Yoga and Carvaka. The two schools have some differences as well. Yoga accepted the conception of personal god , while Samkhya developed as a rationalist, non theistic atheistic system of Hindu philosophy. Sometimes Patanjali's system is referred to as Seshvara Samkhya in contradistinction to Kapila's Nirivara Samkhya. The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that Max Muller says that the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord. Karel Werner argued that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and early Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The Yoga Sutras are also influenced by the Sramana traditions of Buddhism and Jainism, and may represent a further Brahmanical attempt to adopt yoga from the Sramana traditions. As noted by Larson, there are numerous parallels in the concepts in ancient Samkhya, Yoga and Abhidharma Buddhist schools of thought, particularly from 2nd century BCE to 1st century AD. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is a synthesis of these three traditions. From Samkhya, the Yoga Sutras adopt the reflective discernment adhyavasaya of prakrti and purusa dualism , its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three epistemic methods of gaining reliable knowledge. From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of nirodhasamadhi, suggests Larson, Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhism's concept of no self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul. The third concept Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient ascetic traditions of meditation and introspection, as well as the yoga ideas from middle Upanishads such as Katha, Shvetashvatara and Maitri. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are widely regarded as the first compilation of the formal yoga philosophy. The verses of the Yoga Sutras are terse. Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries, such as the Vyasa Bhashya c. 350450 CE . Patanjali defines the word yoga in his second sutra yogas citta vrtti nirodhah Yoga Sutras 1.2 This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. I. K. Taimni translates it as Yoga is the inhibition nirodhah of the modifications vrtti of the mind citta . Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as Yoga is restraining the mind stuff Citta from taking various forms Vrittis . Edwin Bryant explains that, to Patanjali, Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object. If the meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of nirodha mental control , then its goal is the unqualified state of niruddha the perfection of that process , according to Baba Hari Dass. In that context, yoga union implies duality as in joining of two things or principles the result of yoga is the nondual state , and as the union of the lower self and higher Self. The nondual state is characterized by the absence of individuality it can be described as eternal peace, pure love, Self realization, or liberation. Patanjali's writing defined an Ashtanga or Eight Limbed Yoga in Yoga Sutras 2.29. They are In later Hindu scholasticism 12th century onwards , yoga became the name of one of the six orthodox philosophical schools darsanas , which refers to traditions that accept the testimony of Vedas. Yoga and Vedanta are the two largest surviving schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self soul, but diverge in degree, style and some of their methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti. Yoga Yajnavalkya The Yoga Yajnavalkya is a classical treatise on yoga attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya. It takes the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Gargi, a renowned philosopher. The text contains 12 chapters and its origin has been traced to the period between the second century BCE and fourth century CE. Many yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Yoga Kundalini and the Yoga Tattva Upanishads have borrowed verses from or make frequent references to the Yoga Yajnavalkya. The Yoga Yajnavalkya discusses eight yoga Asanas Swastika, Gomukha, Padma, Vira, Simha, Bhadra, Mukta and Mayura, numerous breathing exercises for body cleansing, and meditation. The Buddhist tradition of Abhidharma developed various treatises which further expanded teachings on Buddhist phenomenological theory and yogic techniques. These had a profound influence on Buddhist traditions such as the Mahayana and the Theravada. During the Gupta period 4th to 5th centuries , a movement of northern Mahayana Buddhism termed Yogacara began to be systematized with the writings of the Buddhist scholars Asanga and Vasubandhu. Yogacara Buddhism received the name as it provided a yoga, a systematic framework for engaging in the practices that lead through the path of the bodhisattva towards awakening and full Buddhahood. Its teachings can be found in the comprehensive and encyclopedic work, the Yogacarabhumi Sastra Treatise on the Foundation for Yoga Practitioners , which was also translated into Tibetan and Chinese and thus exerted a profound influence on the East Asian Buddhist and Tibetan Buddhist traditions. According to Mallinson and Singleton, the study of Yogacara Buddhism is essential for the understanding of yoga's early history, and its teachings influenced the text of the Patanjalayogasastra. Like the northern tradition, the south India and Sri Lankan based Theravada school also developed manuals for yogic and meditative training, mainly the Vimuttimagga and the Visuddhimagga. According to Tattvarthasutra, 2nd century CE Jain text, yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body. Umasvati calls yoga the cause of asrava or karmic influx as well as one of the essentialssamyak caritrain the path to liberation. In his Niyamasara, Acarya Kundakunda, describes yoga bhaktidevotion to the path to liberationas the highest form of devotion. Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain Indologists like Prof. Robert J. Zydenbos to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full fledged religion. The five yamas or the constraints of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali bear a resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism, indicating a history of strong cross fertilization between these traditions. Mainstream Hinduism's influence on Jain yoga can be see in Haribhadra's Yogadrstisamuccaya which outlines an eightfold yoga influenced by Patanjali's eightfold yoga. Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Hatha yoga emerged in this period. The Bhakti movement was a development in medieval Hinduism which advocated the concept of a personal God or Supreme Personality of Godhead . The movement was initiated by the Alvars of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries, and it started gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries. Shaiva and Vaishnava bhakti traditions integrated aspects of Yoga Sutras, such as the practical meditative exercises, with devotion. Bhagavata Purana elucidates the practice of a form of yoga called viraha separation bhakti. Viraha bhakti emphasizes one pointed concentration on Krishna. Tantra is a range of esoteric traditions that began to arise in India no later than the 5th century CE. George Samuel states, Tantra is a contested term, but may be considered as a school whose practices appeared in mostly complete form in Buddhist and Hindu texts by about 10th century CE. Tantric yoga developed complex visualizations which included meditation on the body as a microcosm of the cosmos. They included also the use of mantras, pranayama, and the manipulation of the subtle body, including its nadis and cakras. These teachings on cakras and Kundalini would become central to later forms of Indian Yoga. Over its history, some ideas of Tantra school influenced the Hindu, Bon, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Elements of Tantric yoga rituals were adopted by and influenced state functions in medieval Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in East and Southeast Asia. By the turn of the first millennium, hatha yoga emerged from tantra. Vajrayana is also known as Tantric Buddhism and Tantrayana. Its texts were compiled starting with 7th century and Tibetan translations were completed in 8th century CE. These tantra yoga texts were the main source of Buddhist knowledge that was imported into Tibet. They were later translated into Chinese and other Asian languages, helping spread ideas of Tantric Buddhism. The Buddhist text Hevajra Tantra and Caryagiti introduced hierarchies of chakras. Yoga is a significant practice in Tantric Buddhism. The tantra yoga practices include asanas and breathing exercises. The Nyingma tradition practices Yantra yoga Tib. Trul khor , a discipline that includes breath work or pranayama , meditative contemplation and other exercises. In the Nyingma tradition, the path of meditation practice is divided into further stages, such as Kriya yoga, Upa yoga, Yoga yana, Maha yoga, Anu yoga and Ati yoga. The Sarma traditions also include Kriya, Upa called Charya , and Yoga, with the Anuttara yoga class substituting for Mahayoga and Atiyoga. Zen, the name of which derives from the Sanskrit dhyana via the Chinese ch'an is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. Yoga practices integrally exist within the Zen Buddhist school. The earliest references to hatha yoga are in Buddhist works dating from the eighth century. The earliest definition of hatha yoga is found in the 11th century Buddhist text Vimalaprabha, which defines it in relation to the center channel, bindu etc. Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras with posture and breathing exercises. It marks the development of asanas plural into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage and, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word yoga today. Various yogic groups had become prominent in Punjab in the 15th and 16th century, when Sikhism was in its nascent stage. Compositions of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, describe many dialogues he had with Jogis, a Hindu community which practiced yoga. Guru Nanak rejected the austerities, rites and rituals connected with Hatha Yoga. He propounded the path of Sahaja yoga or Nama yoga meditation on the name instead. The Guru Granth Sahib states Listen O Yogi, Nanak tells nothing but the truth. You must discipline your mind. The devotee must meditate on the Word Divine. It is His grace which brings about the union. He understands, he also sees. Good deeds help one merge into Divination. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. In the context of this budding interest, N. C. Paul published his Treatise on Yoga Philosophy in 1851. The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga, not including asanas, to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s. The reception which Swami Vivekananda received built on the active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England Transcendentalists, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson 18031882 , who drew on German Romanticism and philosophers and scholars like G. W. F. Hegel 17701831 , the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel 17671845 and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel 17721829 , Max Mueller 18231900 , Arthur Schopenhauer 17881860 , and others who had to varying degrees interests in things Indian. Theosophists including Madame Blavatsky also had a large influence on the Western public's view of Yoga. Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the spiritual and the physical. The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the mostly Neoplatonism based currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Mircea Eliade brought a new element into the reception of Yoga with the strong emphasis on Tantric Yoga in his seminal book Yoga Immortality and Freedom. With the introduction of the Tantra traditions and philosophy of Yoga, the conception of the transcendent to be attained by Yogic practice shifted from experiencing the transcendent Atman Brahman in Advaitic theory in the mind to the body itself. Yoga as exercise is a physical activity consisting largely of asanas, often connected by flowing sequences called vinyasas, sometimes accompanied by the breathing exercises of pranayama, and usually ending with a period of relaxation or meditation. It is often known simply as yoga, despite the existence of multiple older traditions of yoga within Hinduism where asanas played little or no part, some dating back to the Yoga Sutras, and despite the fact that in no tradition was the practice of asanas central. Yoga as exercise was created in what has been called the Modern Yoga Renaissance by the blending of Western styles of gymnastics with postures from Hatha yoga in India in the 20th century, pioneered by Shri Yogendra and Swami Kuvalayananda. Before 1900 there were few standing poses in Hatha yoga. The flowing sequences of salute to the Sun, Surya Namaskar, were pioneered by the Rajah of Aundh, Bhawanrao Shrinivasrao Pant Pratinidhi, in the 1920s. Many standing poses used in gymnastics were incorporated into yoga by Krishnamacharya in Mysore from the 1930s to the 1950s. Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga Pattabhi Jois created Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, which in turn led to Power Yoga B. K. S. Iyengar created Iyengar Yoga, and systematised the canon of asanas in his 1966 book Light on Yoga Indra Devi taught yoga to many film stars in Hollywood and Krishnamacharya's son T. K. V. Desikachar founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandalam in Chennai. Other major schools founded in the 20th century include Bikram Choudhury's Bikram Yoga and Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh's Sivananda Vedanta Schools of Yoga. Modern yoga spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world. The number of asanas used in yoga as exercise has increased rapidly from a nominal 84 in 1830, as illustrated in Joga Pradipika, to some 200 in Light on Yoga and over 900 performed by Dharma Mittra by 1984. At the same time, the goals of Hatha yoga, namely spiritual liberation moksha through the raising of kundalini energy, were largely replaced by the goals of fitness and relaxation, while many of Hatha yoga's components like the shatkarmas purifications , mudras seals or gestures including the bandhas, locks to restrain the prana or vital principle , and pranayama were much reduced or removed entirely. The term hatha yoga is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, sometimes mainly for women. Yoga has developed into a worldwide multi billion dollar business, involving classes, certification of teachers, clothing, books, videos, equipment, and holidays. The ancient cross legged sitting asanas like lotus pose Padmasana and Siddhasana are widely recognised symbols of yoga. The United Nations General Assembly established 21 June as International Day of Yoga , celebrated annually in India and around the world from 2015. Yoga is practised with a variety of methods by all Indian religions. In Hinduism, practices include Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Laya Yoga and Hatha Yoga. What is often referred to as Classical Yoga, Astanga Yoga of eight limbs , or Raja Yoga is mainly the type of Yoga outlined in the highly influential Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The origins of the Classical Yoga tradition are unclear, though early discussions of the term appear in the Upanishads. The name Raja yoga yoga of kings originally denoted the ultimate goal of yoga, samadhi, but was popularised by Vivekananda as a common name for Ashtanga Yoga, the eight limbs to be practised to attain samadhi, as described in the Yoga Sutras. Yoga is also considered as one of the orthodox philosophical schools darsanas of Hinduism those which accept the Vedas as source of knowledge . Classical yoga incorporates epistemology, metaphysics, ethical practices, systematic exercises and self development techniques for body, mind and spirit. Its epistemology pramana and metaphysics is similar to that of the Sankhya school. The metaphysics of Classical Yoga, like Sankhya, is mainly dualistic, positing that there are two distinct realities. These are prakriti nature , which is the eternal and active unconscious source of the material world and is composed of three gunas, and the purusas persons , the plural consciousnesses which are the intelligent principles of the world, and are multiple, inactive and eternal witnesses. Each person has an individual purusa, which is their true self, the witness and the enjoyer, and that which is liberated. This metaphysical system holds that purusas undergo cycles of reincarnation through its interaction and identification with prakirti. Liberation, the goal of this system, results from the isolation kaivalya of purusa from prakirti, and is achieved through a meditation which detaches oneself from the different forms tattvas of prakirti. This is done by stilling one's thought waves citta vritti and resting in pure awareness of purusa. Unlike the Sankhya school of Hinduism, which pursues a non theistic atheistic rationalist approach, the Yoga school of Hinduism accepts the concept of a personal, yet essentially inactive, deity or personal god Isvara . Buddhist yoga encompasses an extensive variety of methods that aim to develop key virtues or qualities known as the 37 aids to awakening. The ultimate goal of Buddhist yoga is bodhi awakening or nirvana cessation , which is traditionally seen as the permanent end of suffering dukkha and rebirth. Buddhist texts use numerous terms for spiritual praxis besides yoga, such as bhavana development and jhana dhyana. In early Buddhism, various yogic practices were taught including These meditations were seen as being supported by the other elements of the eightfold path, such as the practice of ethics, right exertion, sense restraint and right view. Two mental qualities are said to be indispensable for yogic practice in Buddhism, samatha calm, stability and vipassana insight, clear seeing . Samatha is the quality of a stable, relaxed and calm mind. It is also associated with samadhi mental unification, focus and dhyana a state of meditative absorption . Vipassana meanwhile, is a kind of insight or penetrative understanding into the true nature of phenomena. It is also defined as seeing things as they truly are yathabhutam darsanam . The true nature of things is defined and explained in different ways, but an important and unique feature of classical Buddhism is its understanding of all phenomena dhammas as being empty of a self atman or inherent essence, a doctrine termed Anatta not self and Sunyata emptiness . This is in sharp contrast with most other Indian traditions, whose goals are founded either on the idea of an individual soul atman, jiva, purusha or a universal monistic consciousness Brahman . Vipassana also requires an understanding of suffering or dukkha and thus the four noble truths , impermanence anicca and interdependent origination. Later developments in the various Buddhist traditions led to new innovations in yogic practices. The Theravada school, while remaining relatively conservative, still developed new ideas on meditation and yogic phenomenology in their later works, the most influential of which is the Visuddhimagga. The Indic meditation teachings of Mahayana Buddhism can be seen in influential texts like the Yogacarabhumi Sastra compiled c. 4th century . Mahayana meditation practices also developed and adopted new yogic methods, such as the use of mantra and dharani, pure land practices which aimed at rebirth in a pure land or buddhafield, and visualization methods. Chinese Buddhism developed its own methods, such as the Chan practice of Koan introspection and Hua Tou. Likewise, Tantric Buddhism also Mantrayana, Vajrayana developed and adopted tantric methods, which remain the basis of the Tibetan Buddhist yogic systems, including the Six yogas of Naropa, Kalacakra, Mahamudra and Dzogchen. Jain yoga has been a central practice in Jainism. Jain spirituality is based on a strict code of nonviolence or ahimsa which includes vegetarianism , almsgiving dana , right faith in the three jewels, the practice of austerities tapas such as fasting, and yogic practices. Jain yoga aims at the liberation and purification of the self atma or soul jiva from the forces of karma, which keep all souls bound to the cycle of transmigration. Like Yoga and Sankhya, Jainism believes in a multiplicity of individual souls which bound by their individual karma. Only through the reduction of karmic influxes and the exhaustion of one's collected karma can a soul become purified and released, at which point one becomes an omniscient being who has reaches absolute knowledge kevala jnana . The early practice of Jain yoga seems to have been divided into several types, including meditation dhyana , abandonment of the body kayotsarga , contemplation anupreksa , and reflection bhavana . Some of the earliest sources for Jain yoga are the Uttaradhyayana sutra, the Avasyaka sutra, the Sthananga Sutra c. 2nd century BCE . Later works include Kundakunda's Varassa anuvekkha Twelve Contemplations, c. 1st century BCE to 1st century CE , Haribhadra's Yogadrstisamuccya 8th century and the Yogasastra of Hemachandra 12th century . Later forms of Jain yoga adopted Hindu influences, such as ideas from Patanjali's yoga and later Tantric yoga in the works of Haribhadra and Hemachandra respectively . The Jains also developed a progressive path to liberation through yogic praxis, outlining several levels of virtue called gunasthanas. In the modern era, new forms of Jain meditation have also been developed. One of the most influential ones is the preksa system of Acarya Mahaprajna which is eclectic and includes the use of mantra, breath control, mudras, bandhas, and so on. Vedanta is a varied tradition with numerous sub schools and philosophical views. Vedanta focuses on the study of the Upanishads, and one of its early texts, the Brahma sutras. Regarding yoga or meditation, the Brahma sutras focuses on gaining spiritual knowledge of Brahman, the unchanging absolute reality or Self. One of the earliest and most influential sub traditions of Vedanta, is Advaita Vedanta, which posits nondualistic monism. This tradition emphasizes Jnana yoga yoga of knowledge , which is aimed at realizing the identity of one's atman soul, individual consciousness with Brahman the Absolute consciousness . The most influential thinker of this school is Adi Shankara 8th century , who wrote various commentaries and original works which teach Jnana yoga. In Advaita Vedanta, Jnana is attained on the basis of scripture sruti and one's guru and through a process of listening sravana to teachings, thinking and reflecting on them manana and finally meditating on these teachings nididhyasana in order to realize their truth. It is also important to develop qualities such as discrimination viveka , renunciation viraga , tranquility, temperance, dispassion, endurance, faith, attention and a longing for knowledge and freedom 'mumuksutva .' Yoga in Advaita is ultimately a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness . An influential text which teaches yoga from an Advaita perspective of nondualistic idealism is the Yoga Vasistha. This work uses numerous short stories and anecdotes to illustrate its main ideas. It teaches seven stages or bhumis of yogic practice. It was a major reference for medieval Advaita Vedanta yoga scholars and before the 12th century, it was one of the most popular texts on Hindu yoga. Another text which teaches yoga with an Advaita point of view is the Yoga Yajnavalkya. This work contains extensive teachings on ten Yamas ethical rules and ten Niyamas duties , and eight asanas. It also discusses a theory of nadis and prana vital breath , and follows this with instructions on pranayama breath control , pratyahara sense withdrawal , meditation on mantras, meditative visualizations and Kundalini. Samuel states that Tantrism is a contested concept. Tantra yoga may be described, according to Samuel, as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu Saiva, Shakti texts, which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using geometrical arrays and drawings mandala , fierce male and particularly female deities, transgressive life stage related rituals, extensive use of chakras and mantras, and sexual techniques, all aimed to help one's health, long life and liberation. Hatha yoga, also called hatha vidya, is a kind of yoga focusing on physical and mental strength building exercises and postures described primarily in three texts of Hinduism Many scholars would include the Goraksha Samhita by Gorakshanath of the 11th century in this list. Gorakshanath is widely considered to have been responsible for popularizing hatha yoga as we know it today. Other hatha yoga texts include the Hathabhyasapaddhati, the Hatha Ratnavali, the Joga Pradipika, and the Sritattvanidhi. Vajrayana Buddhism, founded by the Indian Mahasiddhas, has a series of asanas and pranayamas, such as tummo Sanskrit candali and trul khor which parallel hatha yoga. Laya and Kundalini yoga are closely associated with Hatha yoga but are often presented as being independent approaches. According to Georg Feuerstein, Laya yoga yoga of dissolution or merging makes meditative absorption laya its focus. The laya yogin seeks to transcend all memory traces and sensory experiences by dissolving the microcosm, the mind, in the transcendental Self Consciousness. There are various forms and techniques of Laya yoga, including listening to the inner sound nada , practicing various mudras like Khechari mudra and Shambhavi mudra as well as techniques meant to awaken a spiritual energy in the body kundalini . The practice of awakening the coiled energy in the body is sometimes specifically called Kundalini yoga. It is based on Indian theories of the subtle body and uses various pranayamas breath techniques and mudras bodily techniques to awaken the energy known as kundalini the coiled one or shakti. In various Shaiva and Shakta traditions of yoga and tantra, yogic techniques or yuktis are used to unite kundalini shakti, the divine conscious force or energy, with Shiva, universal consciousness. A common way of teaching this method is to awaken the kundalini residing at the lowest chakra and to guide it through the central channel to unite with the absolute consciousness at the highest chakra in the top of the head . Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way. In 2013, Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli, servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger Pope Benedict XVI , said that for his Meditation, a Christian can learn from other religious traditions zen, yoga, controlled respiration, Mantra , quoting Aspects of Christian meditation Just as the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions, neither should these ways be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian. On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured. It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew. Previously, the Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation. In 1989 and 2003, the Vatican issued two documents Aspects of Christian meditation and A Christian reflection on the New Age, that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices. The 2003 document was published as a 90 page handbook detailing the Vatican's position. The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation can degenerate into a cult of the body and that equating bodily states with mysticism could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations. Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge. The letter also says, one can see if and how might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures but maintains the idea that there must be some fit between the nature of prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality. Some which fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity. Another view holds that Christian meditation can lead to religious pluralism. This is held by an interdenominational association of Christians that practice it. The ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains, enhances, and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed. In the early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patanjali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text Amritakunda was translated into Arabic and then Persian. Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures and breath control. Muhammad Ghawth, a Shattari Sufi and one of the translators of yoga text in 16th century, drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs. Malaysia's top Islamic body in 2008 passed a fatwa, prohibiting Muslims from practicing yoga, saying it had elements of Hinduism and that its practice was blasphemy, therefore haraam. Some Muslims in Malaysia who had been practicing yoga for years, criticized the decision as insulting. Sisters in Islam, a women's rights group in Malaysia, also expressed disappointment and said yoga was just a form of exercise. This fatwa is legally enforceable. However, Malaysia's prime minister clarified that yoga as physical exercise is permissible, but the chanting of religious mantras is prohibited. In 2009, the Council of Ulemas, an Islamic body in Indonesia, passed a fatwa banning yoga on the grounds that it contains Hindu elements. These fatwas have, in turn, been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India. Similar fatwas banning yoga, for its link to Hinduism, were issued by the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa in Egypt in 2004, and by Islamic clerics in Singapore earlier. In Iran, as of May 2014, according to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter of them in the capital Tehran, where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives. In May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoglu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga
"Yoga as therapy is the use of yoga as exercise, consisting mainly of postures called asanas, as a gentle form of exercise and relaxation applied specifically with the intention of improving health. This form of yoga is widely practised in classes, and may involve meditation, imagery, breath work pranayama and music. At least three types of health claim have been made for yoga magical claims for medieval hatha yoga, including the power of healing unsupported claims of benefits to organ systems from the practice of asanas and more or less well supported claims of specific medical and psychological benefits from studies of differing sizes using a wide variety of methodologies. Systematic reviews have found beneficial effects of yoga on low back pain and depression, but despite much investigation little or no evidence for benefit for specific medical conditions. Study of trauma sensitive yoga has been hampered by weak methodology. Yoga classes used as therapy usually consist of asanas postures used for stretching , pranayama breathing exercises , and relaxation in savasana lying down . The physical asanas of modern yoga are related to medieval hatha yoga tradition, but they were not widely practiced in India before the early 20th century. The number of schools and styles of yoga in the Western world has grown rapidly from the late 20th century. By 2012, there were at least 19 widespread styles from Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga to Viniyoga. These emphasise different aspects including aerobic exercise, precision in the asanas, and spirituality in the hatha yoga tradition. These aspects can be illustrated by schools with distinctive styles. Thus, Bikram Yoga has an aerobic exercise style with rooms heated to 105 F 41 C and a fixed sequence of 2 breathing exercises and 26 asanas performed in every session. Iyengar Yoga emphasises correct alignment in the postures, working slowly, if necessary with props, and ending with relaxation. Sivananda Yoga focuses more on spiritual practice, with 12 basic poses, chanting in Sanskrit, pranayama breathing exercises, meditation, and relaxation in each class, and importance is placed on vegetarian diet. At least three different types of claim of therapeutic benefit have been made for yoga from medieval times onwards, not counting the more general claims of good health made throughout this period magical powers, biomedical claims for marketing purposes, and specific medical claims. Neither of the first two are supported by reliable evidence. The medical claims are supported by evidence of varying quality, from case studies to controlled trials and ultimately systematic review of multiple trials. Medieval authors asserted that Hatha yoga brought physical as well as spiritual benefits, and provided magical powers including of healing. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika HYP states that asanas in general, described as the first auxiliary of hatha yoga, give steadiness, good health, and lightness of limb. HYP 1.17 Specific asanas, it claims, bring additional benefits for example, Matsyendrasana awakens Kundalini and helps to prevent semen from being shed involuntarily HYP 1.27 Paschimottanasana stokes up the digestive fire, slims the belly and gives good health HYP 1.29 Shavasana takes away fatigue and relaxes the mind HYP 1.32 while Padmasana destroys all diseases HYP 1.47 . These claims lie within a tradition across all forms of yoga that practitioners can gain supernatural powers. Hemachandra's Yogashastra 1.89 lists the magical powers, which include healing and the destruction of poisons. Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, have for various reasons made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. The yoga scholar Suzanne Newcombe argues that this was one of several visions of yoga as in some sense therapeutic, ranging from medical to a more popular offer of health and well being. The yoga scholar Andrea Jain describes these claims of Iyengar's in terms of elaborating and fortifying his yoga brand and mass marketing , calling Iyengar's 1966 book Light on Yoga arguably the most significant event in the process of elaborating the brand . The yoga teacher Bernie Gourley notes that the book neither describes contraindications systematically, nor provides evidence for the claimed benefits. Jain suggests that Its biomedical dialect was attractive to many. For example, in the book, Iyengar claims that the asanas of the Eka Pada Sirsasana cycle ...tone up the muscular, nervous and circulatory systems of the entire body. The spine receives a rich supply of blood, which increases the nervous energy in the chakras the various nerve plexuses situated in the spine , the flywheels in the human body machine. These poses develop the chest and make the breathing fuller and the body firmer they stop nervous trembling of the body and prevent the diseases which cause it they also help to eliminate toxins by supplying pure blood to every part of the body and bringing the congested blood back to the heart and lungs for purification. The history of such claims was reviewed by William J. Broad in his 2012 book The Science of Yoga. Broad argues that while the health claims for yoga began as Hindu nationalist posturing, it turns out that there is ironically a wealth of real benefits . Newcombe notes that Iyengar was sickly as a child, and that yoga with his brother in law Krishnamacharya had improved his health it had also helped his daughter Geeta, so his response to his students' health issues was an intense and personal one. In effect, Newcombe argues, Iyengar was treating remedial yoga as analogous to Henrik Ling's medical gymnastics. As early as 1940, Iyengar was using yoga as a therapy for common conditions such as sinus problems, backache, and fatigue. Iyengar was willing to push people through pain to them new possibilities. In the 1960s, he trained a few people such as Diana Clifton and Silva Mehta to deliver this remedial yoga particular asanas were used for different conditions, and non remedial Iyengar Yoga teachers were taught to tell students that ordinary classes were not suitable for serious health issues . Mehta taught a remedial yoga class in the Iyengar Yoga Institute in Maida Vale from its opening in 1984 she contributed Remedial Programs for conditions such as arthritis, backache, knee cartilage problems, pregnancy, sciatica, scoliosis and varicose veins in the Mehtas' 1990 book Yoga the Iyengar Way. However, Iyengar was deferential to Western medicine and its assessments, so in Newcombe's view Iyengar Yoga is positioned as complementary to standard medical treatment rather than as an alternative . Newcombe argues that in Britain, yoga largely avoided overt conflict with the medical profession by simultaneously professionalising with educational qualifications and deferring to medical expertise. After Richard Hittleman's Yoga for Health series on ITV from 1971 to 1974, the series producer Howard Kent founded a charity, the Yoga for Health Foundation, to Research into the therapeutic benefits to be obtained by the practice of yoga residential courses began in 1978 at Ickwell Bury in Bedfordshire. The Foundation stated that yoga was not a therapy or cure but had therapeutic benefits , whether physical, mental, or emotional, and it worked especially with the physically handicapped . Newcombe notes that a third organisation, the Yoga Biomedical Trust, was founded in Cambridge in 1983 by a biologist, Robin Monro, to research complementary therapies. He found it hard to obtain research funding, and in the 1990s moved to London, focusing on training yoga teachers in yoga as therapy and providing yoga as individualised therapy, using pranayama, relaxation and asanas. From the point of view of sports medicine, asanas function as active stretches, helping to protect muscles from injury these need to be performed equally on both sides, the stronger side first if used for physical rehabilitation. Researchers have studied the medical and psychological effects of yoga as exercise in a wide range of trials and observational studies, sometimes with careful controls, providing evidence of differing quality about yoga's possible benefits. The various types of claim, and the evidence for them, are discussed below. Much of the research on the therapeutic use of yoga has been in the form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality, including small sample sizes, inadequate control and blinding, lack of randomization, and high risk of bias. Further research is needed to quantify the benefits and to clarify the mechanisms involved. For example, a 2010 literature review on the use of yoga for depression stated, although the results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations. A 2015 systematic review on the effect of yoga on mood and the brain recommended that future clinical trials should apply more methodological rigour. The practice of asanas has been claimed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance to alleviate stress and anxiety, and to reduce the symptoms of lower back pain, without necessarily demonstrating the precise mechanisms involved. A review of five studies noted that three psychological positive affect, mindfulness, self compassion and four biological mechanisms posterior hypothalamus, interleukin 6, C reactive protein and cortisol that might act on stress had been examined empirically, whereas many other potential mechanisms remained to be studied four of the mechanisms positive affect, self compassion, inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus and salivary cortisol were found to mediate yoga's effect on stress. Back pain is one reason people take up yoga, and since at least the 1960s some practitioners have claimed that it relieved their symptoms. A 2013 systematic review on the use of yoga for low back pain found strong evidence for short and long term effects on pain, and moderate evidence for long term benefit in back specific disability, with no serious adverse events. Ten randomised controlled trials were analysed, of which eight had a low risk of bias. The outcomes measured included improvements in pain, back specific disability, generic disability, health related quality of life, and global improvement . The review stated that yoga can be recommended as an additional therapy to chronic low back pain patients. A 2013 systematic review on the use of yoga for depression found moderate evidence of short term benefit over usual care and limited evidence compared to relaxation and aerobic exercise. Only 3 of 12 randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias. The diversity of the studies precluded analysis of long term effects. A 2015 systematic review on the effect of yoga on mood and the brain concluded that yoga is associated with better regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal system, as well as a decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms in a range of populations. A systematic review in 2017 found some evidence of benefit in major depressive disorder, examining outcomes primarily of improvements in remission rates and severity of depression and secondarily of anxiety and adverse events , but considered that better randomised controlled trials were required. Trauma sensitive yoga has been developed by David Emerson and others of the Trauma Center at the Justice Resource Institute in Brookline, Massachusetts. The center uses yoga alongside other treatments to support recovery from traumatic episodes and to enable healing from PTSD. Workers including Bessel van der Kolk and Richard Miller have studied how clients can regain comfort in their bodies, counteract rumination, and improve self regulation through yoga. A 2018 systematic review of 12 studies, that had individually found positive effects compared to their control groups, was unable to find strong evidence of benefit from yoga for post traumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety following traumatic experiences, and called for more rigorous study design. A 2012 survey of yoga in Australia notes that there is good evidence that yoga and its associated healthy lifestyleoften vegetarian, usually non smoking, preferring organic food, drinking less or no alcoholare beneficial for cardiovascular health, but that there was little apparent uptake of yoga to address cardiovascular conditions and risk factors . Yoga was cited by respondents as a cause of these lifestyle changes the survey notes that the relative importance of the various factors had not been assessed. There is little reliable evidence that yoga is beneficial for specific medical conditions, and an increasing amount of evidence that it is not, as follows. A systematic review in 2013 found weak evidence for the use of yoga for rheumatic diseases, examining outcomes of pain and disability, with no evidence of its safety. A 2015 systematic review found no evidence of benefit in treatment of epilepsy or menopause related symptoms. According to the American Cancer Society, practice of yoga can improve strength and balance in cancer patients, is unlikely to cause harm , and does not interfere with cancer treatment . The society notes that yoga cannot cure cancer but that yoga may help to improve the quality of life in cancer survivors, as shown in a randomised controlled trial of women who had had breast cancer. Measured outcomes included fatigue, depression, and sleep quality. A systematic review in 2015 found promising evidence that exercise helps people with dementia perform activities of daily living ADLs , but no evidence that cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or depression were benefited yoga was not distinguished from other forms of exercise. A 2010 systematic review showed no effect of yoga on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, measured by teacher rating on the ADHD overall scale. A systematic review in 2019 concluded that there was not enough evidence to be able to assess the effectiveness of yoga for treating women with urinary incontinence. Although relatively safe, yoga is not a risk free form of exercise. Sensible precautions can usefully be taken for example the avoidance of advanced moves by beginners, not combining practice with psychoactive drug use, and avoiding competitiveness. A small percentage of yoga practitioners each year suffer physical injuries analogous to sports injuries. The practice of yoga has been cited as a cause of hyperextension or rotation of the neck, which may be a precipitating factor in cervical artery dissection.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga%20as%20therapy
"Yoga the Iyengar Way is a 1990 guide to Iyengar Yoga, a style of modern yoga as exercise, by the yoga teachers Silva Mehta and her children Mira Mehta and Shyam Mehta. They were among the first teachers to be trained by B. K. S. Iyengar outside India. The main part of the book is on asanas, yoga postures. This is accompanied by an introduction to yoga, and sections on pranayama yoga breathing , the philosophy of yoga, the surrender of the self including meditation, and recommended courses of asanas for different conditions. The book presents the asanas with a combination of a brief text and photographs of Mira and Shyam on a single page or a double page spread. The book has been well received by critics, who have called it an influential classic textbook and a backlist bestseller . The authors have been portrayed in some of the asanas illustrated in the book in a set of Indian postage stamps. At the time of the book's publication, Silva, Mira, and Shyam Mehta were teachers of Iyengar Yoga at the Iyengar Yoga Institute in Maida Vale, London. Silva, mother of Shyam and Mira, records that she had a crush fracture of the spine at age 25, leading to osteoarthritis. Yoga with B. K. S. Iyengar relieved the pain, and she went on to work helping people with physical problems to practise remedial yoga. Shyam and Mira learnt yoga from Iyengar from an early age. Shyam states that yoga has given him determination and the ability to concentrate on office work. Mira had a scoliosis which she gradually overcame with yoga, eventually becoming a full time yoga teacher. Silva ran the first yoga teacher training program approved by the Inner London Education Authority, from 1970. Mira has been called the most senior Yoga teacher outside India, recognised as an authority in all its aspects asana, pranayama, philosophy and therapy. Yoga the Iyengar Way was published in paperback by Dorling Kindersley London in 1990. It was reprinted in 2006 by A. A. Knopf New York and distributed by Random House, who describe it as a backlist bestseller . The book has been translated into Dutch, French, German, Korean, and Spanish. The book is arranged with an introductory section, three main parts, and an appendix. Each asana is described with a combination of short paragraphs of text and photographs about half in colour of Shyam or Mira Mehta. The book is in a large format, 215 mm 275 mm 8.5 in 10.8 in , close to A4 size, allowing for a large photograph of each asana together with several smaller ones showing details and stages for entering the pose. Some of the key Iyengar Yoga asanas such as Utthita Trikonasana are given a double page spread others get a single page. Each pose is named in Sanskrit in a pale colour, giving the effect of a decorative frieze at the top of the page and in transliteration with diacritic marks. Below that is an explanation of the meaning of the Sanskrit words, and a brief summary of what the pose achieves. Utthita Trikonasana is described in three steps, each with a small photograph the width of a column of text. A pair of small detail photographs show how to hold the ankle or to use a yoga brick for support. A 'focus' section instructs points to note in the pose. An inset photograph in the main image gives a back view, complete with detailed instructions in the caption for the attention needed to the back in the pose. A final 'Work in the posture' section instructs on the movements required to achieve a good posture in the asana. The scholar of religion Andrea Jain, in her study of the sociology of yoga, describes the Mehtas as a family of senior Iyengar Yoga teachers. Yoga Matters calls Yoga the Iyengar Way an influential classic textbook. The journalist and yoga teacher Ann Pizer, writing on Very Well Fit, rated it the best overall runner up yoga book of 2019, writing that the photos may look a little dated because of the unitards. However, they're almost preferable to the 'sexy' photos so often seen in more recent books. Pizer comments that many practitioners see the book as a complement to Iyengar's own Light on Yoga, and that the combination of big colour illustrations and explicit alignment points actually make it rather more approachable. The yoga teacher and journalist Marina Jung, writing in Australian Yoga Life, called the book a bestseller and highly influential throughout the world . The book's authors and their exemplary asanas are commemorated in a set of Indian postage stamps. Mira and Shyam appeared on a set of 4 stamps issued by the Indian Department of Posts in 1991 Shyam wearing blue in Bhujangasana on a 2 rupee stamp, and in Dhanurasana on a 5 rupee stamp Mira wearing red in Ustrasana on a 6.50 rupee stamp, and in Utthita Trikonasana on a 10 rupee stamp the images, all redrawn from photographs in the book, were described as perfect postures . These references indicate the parts of the Yoga the Iyengar Way text being discussed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga%20the%20Iyengar%20Way
